## About the Data

These datasets were used just for generated DLTN Metadata documentation; these will not be the final sets to be migrated into DLTN datastore for harvest by the DPLA.

Significant changes in metadata structure (schema changes, for example), will require the docs be updated accordingly.

## Documentation

See the Documentation subdirectory for the DLTN MODS MAP, which has preliminary mapping to DPLA MAP v.4. Local institution > DLTN MODS mappings will be in that folder as well as XSLT for each mapping's proposed transformation.

Local dataset review sheets are in the Documentation folder as well.
