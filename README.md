## About the Data

These datasets were used just for generated DLTN Metadata documentation.

## Documentation

See the Documentation subdirectory for the DLTN MODS MAP, which has preliminary mapping to DPLA MAP v.4. Local institution > DLTN MODS mappings will be in that folder as well as XSLT for each mapping's proposed transformation.

Local dataset review sheets can be found on the following wiki: https://wiki.lib.utk.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1901100
