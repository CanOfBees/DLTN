DPLA Metadata, Tech, and Content Information form
Most of the twenty-three questions on this form are required. If you do not have a response for a question, please answer "no response" or "n/a." 
It will take you about thirty minutes to complete the form and will require information about your collections, metadata schema, repository, and method for sharing records with DPLA.

If you have questions or need more information about the form, please contact Gretchen Gueguen, DPLA data specialist, at gretchen@dp.la.
