<dc:description>Mrs. L. C. French Appears
Before City Commission.
No   Petition   of   Complaint
Filed,   However—Street
Matters Talked.
The regular weekly meeting- of
the city commission yesterday
morning was featured by a spirited
denial by Mrs. L. Crozier French
that dances held in the Lyceum
building- are ever &quot;disorderly&quot; and
a characterization of the institution
as &quot;the only place I know of where
respectable young people may
dance.&quot; Mrs. -Frenc's address be-
fore the commissions was in anticipation of a petition of complaint
which she said she had been told
was to be introduced, but which
was not.
&quot;I have been in charge of the
woman's building for 15 years.&quot;
Mrs. French declared,&quot;, I have heard
continually complaints of dances
there being disorderly, but there has
never, as a matter of fact, been a
disorderly     dance     there. That
building was built so that dances
could be held in it and it's the only
place I know of where respectable
young   people   can      dance. We
have a rule that dances shall stop
at 11:30 and that we consider &amp;
respectable   hour.
&quot;We have required the young
men who have the dances in charge
to  have  a  doorkeeper and  a  plain
clothes man and a police matron to
attend, particularly to watch after
the girls. It seems to me that it
is our duty to give the young people a place to dance. What these
people mean by disorderly is  noise!
&quot;Now the other day there was an
orchestra going to pass through the
city and it was secured for a dance
here.     It   is   a   famous   New   York
orchestra and  this was  to be a  society event.    Now you know that society
never   goes  to  a   dance  before
10 o'clock and it is against  the law
for  them   to close  before 2.    I  was
the   hall   all   the    time   till      1
•    „**   '&quot;■■■• ladies chaperoned
after that.
&quot;That was a splendid band. I
wish that all the neighbors could
have been in that hall and heard
them. They would have been entertained, I am sure. There is a
great deal of time lost in sleep, especially by students. At 11 o'clock
a policeman appeared and said that
there had been a complaint of the
dance made at police headquarters.
Now the elite of the city was there
and that dance was not disorderly.
I assured the policeman that it was
not and he was satisfied and went
away.
Worth $5 to Her.
&quot;The dance went on till a quarter
of two and I wouldn't take $5 for
my part in it. Are We never to
have anything like that for fear of
breaking some man's slumber? It
hurts people to lose their tempers,
not to lose sleep, I give you that
free of charge.
&quot;I claim that the respectable
young people of the city have the
right to dance till half past 11
o'clock. Without the dances we
can't run the Woman's Building.
Everything in the building is all
right, if anything goes on outside
the building you are responsible,
not me, for you are responsible for
the  streets  of Knoxville.&quot;
Mayor Neal stated at the conslu-
sion of Mrs. French's remarks that
there was no action the board could
take as the petition anticipated by
her had  not been presented.

<dc:description>CO-OPERATE, INSTEAD OF
CRITICIZING COMMISSION

&quot;I have met many women who
criticise the city and the commissioners, but I have met few people who
are willing to spend the time bettering these conditions,&quot; stated Mrs. L.
Crozier French, at the weekly meeting of the good citizenship class,
which is held at the Lawson-McGhee
library every   Thursday  afternoon.
Mrs.   French   stated   that    women
had sufficient time to study the gov-
ernment, constitution and laws, and:
should put some thought on them es-
pecially since they have been granted
the franchise.
Mrs. French is opposed to the recall movement, because the citizens
were the ones who put the present
commission in office.
She advocates the mayor being
made the financial agent of the city.
She does not believe the present commissioner of finance is incapable,
but the office should be occupied by
the mayor.
She states the present commission
came into office when the city government was nearly bankrupt, and
could not be expected to immediately
put it on a sound basis.
This organization meets every
Thursday afternoon. The first meeting day of the month it discusses the
United States constitution,, the second Thursday of the month it studies
the laws of Tennessee, and the third
and fourth Thursdays are used in
studying the city government. It is
hoped that many women will take
the  opportunity  of    learning    some
helpful facts concerning the government, by attending the meetings.

<dc:description>MRS. L. CROZIER-FRENCH
MRS.  L. CROZIER  FRENCH 

Those   who   recall   the   active   interest
taken by Mrs.  L.  Crazier French in the 
club   world   of   Birmingham   during   her 
residence in this city and who know the
fearless policy and the thorough investigation she makes of all matters to which 
she   calls   public   attention,   will   not   be
surprised   at   her   latest   enterprise,    the 
starting   of   a   monthly   journal     to     be 
known  as   &quot;The People.&quot; 
Mrs. French will be editor and manager
of her journal, the first number of which
will  be  issued  in  Knoxville  this  month.
Mrs. French intends that her journal
shall be an exponent of the people. It Is
to be a publication that will fearlessly
defend the rights and privileges of the
people and will vigorously demand the
enforcement of the laws that have been
enacted for the good government of the
people. It will contain news of the
month, current events, articles political
and literary, items concerning art, science, religion, health, ethics and education.
No one will doubt that this journal will
be conducted on broad and educative
lines and that it will be a potent factor
in promoting good government.
Mrs. French's aims will be to arouse the
people of her city to certain conditions
that now exist and she asks co-operation in the effort to rescue municipal
and county affairs from the hands of the
partisan politicians, be they Republicans
or Democrats. She believes that for a
people to allow partisans to manage their
municipal and county affairs is to submit to be made victims of the spoils system. Mrs. French's journal, in other
words is to be devoted to &quot;the idealizing
of the real and the realizing of the ideal.&quot;
Among the pertinent questions asked by
Mrs. French, and which may strike a
responsive chord in many cities are the
following:
Why should the Sunday closing law be
enforced against stores in general but
not against barrooms?
Why was the office of police matron
abolished, after having been in successful operation for ten years? Abolished,
notwithstanding the earnest protest of
Knoxville's  best  citizens.
Why is it that we have not enough
money to make our public schools what
they should be?
Why is it that we have not even one
little plat of ground for a resting place
in  the  heat  of  summer?
Why is it that the ordinances in regard to the keeping of our streets free
of filth are not in any  degree enforced?
It is because the people have not organized.
It is because the people have not said
to the officials, &quot;You must do your duty!&quot;
It is because the people have not said
to the ring leaders, &quot;Thus far shalt thou
go  and no  farther.&quot;
It is because the people have had no
means of expressing their will.
This need of the people is a vital one.

<dc:description>To Mrs. L. C. French.
You are a wiser woman than I—who
am only an inconsequent citizen of a
rather conservative section—and it does
not become me to advise you, particularly in public, but &quot;suffer it to be so&quot;
this once for the sake of &quot;progress&quot; which
you so dearly love.
&quot;Don't give up the ship&quot;—which in
this case is no ship at all, but simply
a prospective little plat in a parkless
city.
You have initiated numerous reforms,
you have valiently led the way in many
noble movements.
Continue, I pray you, in well doing
yet a little longer, and champion this
much neglected cause to a glorious victory.
One swallow, we are told, never yet
made a summer, no more can one man—
be he mayor or what not—make a city.
Mr. McTeer was surely jesting when
he put the comfort and convenience of
himself and his horses, splendid animals
tho' they be, before the good and the
beauty of the town, but mayor or no mayor, let us have the park. It is high
time somebody made a move in this direction.
In the last census reports our city
stands out among her sisters in disgraceful distinction thus—&quot;Knoxville has no
parks!&quot;
What sermons might be preached on
these words for a text—&quot;Knoxville has
no parks!&quot;
What a commentary they form on the
enterprise  and ambition of her citizens.
The statement has been sown broadcast over the land, and all the world
knows or may know, that Knoxville is
the only city of its size in our country,
in all the world, like enough, which has
not a single park, plat or public square.
Think of it, men, brethren and sisters.
Think of it, and then subscribe not merely one dollar but every dollar you can
rake and scrape together to save this little plat from desecration
A CITIZEN.

<dc:description>In speaking of Mrs. L. C. French,
who is now in Chattanooga, the Chattanooga News says:
&quot;Mrs. Lizzie Crozier French is a frequent and welcome visitor in this city.
She  is  known  throughout    Tennessee
and the south as a woman who is pro-
gressive in the truest sense' of that term,
whose mind, heart and soul reflect only
that which is good and reject all that
is   evil.    Educated  to   a high   degree,
possessing rare refinement,   she unites
personal magnetism and love of humanity to such an extent that she is equally
approachable to the lowest and the high
est.    The proudest women in Tennesse
claim her as their personal friend. She
 is the founder of Ossoli Circle, Knoxville, the first federated club    in    the
south.

This Afternoon by Judge
R. P. Williams
PROPHETIC TOPIC
Municipal and State Government and Suggested Improvements Discussed
Ossoli Circle devoted its session
Monday afternoon to the timely con-
ideration of &quot;Our Local Government&quot;&quot; Mrs, L. Crozier French, chairman of the political science department which arranged the program,
termed the selection of this subject,
&quot;almost prophetic&quot; since the topic
was chosen several months ago and
is now so appropriate in view of the
recent enfranchisement of women
of Tennessee in municipal and presidential elections.
&quot;The County System of Tennessee,&quot; was discussed by Mrs. Lewis
Tillman with special reference to
the administration of the county government.
Miss Leah Fletcher led the general discussion on &quot;Suggested Improvements.&quot; Needed  changes in county
 government   were   subjects   of   brief
 talks by various members of the circle.
Recorder Williams'  Address
Recorder  Williams   in   his  address
on   &quot;Machinery  of Voting&quot; ' said    in
 part:
&quot;Madame   chairman   and   ladies:   I
 know of no higher honor that could
I be conferred upon a man than to ad-
dress this organization.  It being the
oldest  in   the   city  and   composed   of
 women who believe in   doing things.
 I  am not a  new  convert  to  woman
suffrage. I have believed in it many
 years and declared for it in a school
address     at     Fountain      City     High
school.   Why?   Because   I   believe in
women. If you will pardon me I will
 prove to you that the women of this
country  and the   world  have  always
been faithful  to  every  trust.  Let us
go  back  to  when   our     Savior     was i
crucified. What does the Bible teach 
us. That all of the men deserted and a woman  followed him to the cross.
Who was it first met Him when He 
arose from the grave? It was a woman.
Who  was   it  that  has   been  the 
stand  by  of the  church  and  schools
of   this   country   and   watched   after
the interest of the children while the
men   were   chasing   the   rainbow   of
fame or the almighty dollar? It was
the women.  Who was  the  (missing)

duties. The last legislature made it
a misdeameanor or fine for a person appointed to hold an election
not to serve without good cause.
&quot;They  appoint  an   officer  of election,   three   judges,   two   clerks,   two
registrars and one marker. The polls
in  the  cities  open  at  9  o'clock  and
close  at  7  p. m., in  the county district at 9 o'clock and close at 4 p. m.
How To Vote
&quot;Ladies, you no doubt would be surprised   when   I   tell  you   that   in   every
ward  in  the  city of  Knoxville at  each
election   there   are   ballots   not   counted
 simply  because  the man   who cast the
I ballot   did   not  know  how  to  mark  his
ticket.    The law requires he shall place
an X or cross mark opposite the name he
desires to vote for and instead of doing
that he scratched out the name of the
man he did not want to vote for.    The
law further requires you must pay your
poll tax thirty days before, the election. This tax for elections held in 1919 would 
 be the poll tax for the year 1918. There
ihas been a question raised that the la-
dies will not have to pay poll taxes to
 vote in 1919 as they were not assessed.
 This is a question of law that should De
looked  into,   in  fact  it  is  such  an im-
portant  question   in  my  opinion  a  test
case   should   be   brought   and   tested   in
supreme   court before our next  city elec- 
tion.   I know able attorneys have stated
you  are not liable for the poll tax  because you were not assessed.    There are
hundreds of voters in the city of Knoxville  who  are not assesed  by  the  tax
assessor on January 10, as the law requires,  their names are not on the  tax
books, but they desire to vote and they
go to  the trustee's office more than a
year after the assessment is made and
pay their two dollars.    This is placed on
the   pick-up   list   as   the   name   of   Mrs.
George   Templeton   was   placed   a   few
days ago.    On election day you will get
registration   certificates   and   your   poll
tax  receipt  and  go   to   the  polls.     You
will first go to  one  of the registrars  and
present  your  credentials.    He will give
you   your   ballot.   Then   you   will   hand
your   registration   certificate   and   your
ballot to what is known as the marker.
He  will  take both  and  place  the same
number, say 22, on both certificate and,
ballot.    This is done to keep any ballots
being voted from the outside or marked
by some one else than the voter. After
I this you will then go in the booth and
make a cross mark after the names of
each person you desire to vote for. Then
you will go to the officer of election, give
him your ballot, registration certificate
and  poll  tax receipt.    He  will call  out
your name and it will be checked on the
registration book by the registrars and
officer   will   say  voted  and  place  your
ballot in the box.
&quot;At 7 o'clock the officer of election
will announce the polls are closed and
no one is allowed to vote after that
hour. The officer then opens the ballot
box and from the ballots he calls each
name that has a cross mark opposite
the name. The two clerks on the talley
sheet record the votes, making a
straight mark for each vote including
No. 4 and the fifth vote received by a
candidate the clerk makes a slanting
mark across the four and says talley:
each clerk must have the same record
and this is kept up until all of the votes
are counted and the officer, judges and 
clerks sign the returns from their respective precincts and took by them to the
county election commission who meet at
the courthouse in each county and can-
vass the returns and make their reports on the results. If city officers are
to be elected, they report to tne city
commission, state officers to the state
election commission and secretary of
state. The judge's duty is to watch the
ballots and to pass upon all disputes, If
a man has made false statement or has
moved and his vote has been challenged
by some voter or citizen, then it is the
duty of the judge to pass upon the question if he is a legal voter.
Must  Pay   Poll  Tax

on   January  10,  the year  preceding  tne
e.iection, up to fifty [years] of age, must

<dc:description>&quot;I am owner of the Sphere,
Of the seven stars and the solar year,
Of Caesar's  hand and  Plato's  brain,
Of   Lord   Christ's   heart   and   Shakespeare's  strain.&quot;
This was the keynote to Mrs. L.
Crozier French's brilliant and interesting talk yesterday afternoon at the
Carnegie Library at 3:30 o'clock be-
fore a large and representative audi-
ence. The speaker was introduced with
a happy speech by Mr. G. H. Baskette.
&quot;Unity and Individuality,&quot; the topic
chosen by Mrs. French, was intelligent-
ly and cleverly handled. The quotations taken from the theories of eminent philosophers and scientist's who
have expressed their views along this
line, of Time, Space, Mind, Force, Matter, Motion, Life, Law, Light, Love,
Cause, Consequence, Circles, Color,
Chord, were dissected and interpreted
intelligentily, she also giving her own
ideas along these lines. The application of her subject was taken in like
manner:
&quot;The family, The Duties of Each
Member;&quot; &quot;Mother's Liberties;&quot;
&quot;Fathers' Privileges;&quot; &quot;Children's
Freedom;&quot; &quot;What About Punishment?&quot;
&quot;Who Is Mistress of the Kitchen?&quot;
The talk was delightfully informal,
many of her hearers asking questions
in regard to her subject. Her subject
this afternoon at the same hour at the
library will be on &quot;Dual Forces.&quot; She
will treat of the dual Sources in nature,
art  and literature.
On Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock
Mock Congress will take place, tendered by Mrs. L. Crozier French to the
club women of Nashville as an acknowledgement of the many courtesies
extended to her during her visit.
The  Call.
Notice is hereby given that on April
23, 1910, at Nashville, Tenn., will be
held a national congress of women to
discuss the most practical and effective
means of inducing governments to
give official recognition of the influence of women in human affairs by
establishing a department which shall
be the instrument by which this influence may be focussed and used as
the most important factor in social
progress.
Each state is entitled to four delegates. The credential card shall contain the name and address of, the delegate with the endorsement of the wife
of the governor of the state. As the
delegates must be individualized (if
married) it is desired that all such
subscribe themselves, giving name and
maiden name and a hyphen before the
husband's name which latter must be
spelled with a small letter.
No   delegate   will   be   allowed   from
Utah,     Wyoming,   Idaho     or   Colorado
having mired in the dirty Pool of politics. They are unfitted to associate with
women of influence.

Machinery of Voting
&quot;But my subject is the  Machinery
of Voting:   Years ago the sheriff of
the   various   counties   held   the   elections. But  the law has  changed and
now in Tennesseee we have  what is
known as the state board of election
commissioners. These men are elect-
ed   by   the   members   of  the   legislature,   two from   the   majority   party
and one by the minority party. This
board   meets   in   Nashville   and   they
appoint   three   men   in   each   county
who are known as the county board
of elections. 
&quot;Two are named from the majority
party and one from the minority
party. Elections are held in Tennessee every two years. In August the
year preceeding the election to be held the various county boards ap- 
point two men at each voting precinct to open the regislation books
for all qualified voters to register.
&quot;These books remain open for ten
days. To be a qualified voter in Tennessee you must be twenty-one years
of age before the day of election. It
is the duty of every qualified voter
when the biennial registration is held
to go to his voting precinct and register. You give the registrars your
name and address, your age, how
long you have lived in Tennessee and
how long you have lived in the county and district, also what state you
were born.
To be a voted and entitled to a registration   certificate  you   must   be  a
resident   of  the   state  one  year  and
the   county   six  months   and  district
twenty days.  If you  fail   to  register
during the general registration of ten
days  there  is  a  second  chance.   The
law  provides   that  twenty  days  before   each   election   that   the   county
election commission    shall      appoint
registrars   to   keep   the   books   open
three days, and this is known as the
 supplementary registration.       If you
 move   from   one   house     to    another
on   the  street    you     must    register.
The   registrars   are   two   in   number,
one a democrat and the other republican.   They  issue   you   a   certificate
good   for  two  years     from     August,
1919,   providing  you  do    not    move.
They  also   place your  name   on   the |
registration   book    numerically    and
then they copy it on  the other book
in   aphabetical   form.     Should     you
lose   or   mislay  your   certificate   you
can   go   to   the   polls,   call   upon   the
register to give you your number and
your   name   being  on   the   book,   you
are entitled to vote.
&quot;The next step is voting. The
county election commissioners' next
duty, ten davs before the election is
to appoint nine persons in each voting precinct to hold the election as
is named by law. All must take oath
of office  before  entering   upon   their (missing)

<dc:description>MRS. L. CROZIER FRENCH

WOMAN'S CANDIDATE FOR
COUNCILMAN FROM THE CITY-AT-LARGE
To The Voters of Knoxville —
Because of the failure of the committee of 18 to nominate a woman on the &quot;People's Ticket,&quot; a number of warm advocates of the city manager charter have requested me to allow them to put forward my
name as a candidate for nomination for councilman-at-large at the primary election, September 15th, 1923.
My consent has been given because I believe in a &quot;square deal for all&quot;—young and old, rich and poor,
white and black and men and women. Those who bear the burdens of family and municipal life should be
regarded as equal factors in home and city and no ban should be put on mothers and business women, because of sex.
My record as a public spirited citizen is known to all of those who have given attention to the educational and welfare activities of Knoxville during the last half century.
In 1885, with my sister, I took charge of the Female Institute which my grandfather, John Crozier,
(first postmaster) helped to found. About that time I bought a home and have been a tax payer ever
since.
In that same year I organized the
Ossoli Circle, a literary society for
women which has the distinction of
being the oldest club for women in
the south. At the end of five years,
being disappointed that I could not
prevail upon Ossoli Circle to take up
work for civic betterment, I organized the Woman's Educational and
Industrial Union.
Having educated my son and
started him in a successful business
career, I gave up my school and devoted my whole time to educational
and uplift work for city and state.
As soon as the trustees voted to admit girls to our university, the then
president, Dr. Charles Dabney, wrote
to me: &quot;The thing you have so long
worked for has come to pass—the
University of Tennessee is no[w] coeducational.&quot;
About 1890 I induced the city
council to establish the office of police matron, Knoxville thus became
the first city in the south to put a
woman in charge of women offenders. About this time I began soliciting the county court to establish an
industrial school for girls and boys.
Seven years from that time I was
successful and saw the present institution established.
I persuaded the King's Daughters
to establish the first kindergarten in
this city. —	
The first woman's exchange I also put in operation. A lady is now doing a splendid trade in beaten
biscuit who began as a child to make biscuit for that exchange.
All the time I was working to establish these permanent institutions I was helping the police matron
in rescue work.    Many girls who had taken the first downward step we returned to respectable society.
It is impossible for me to enumerate here all the civic activities that I have helped forward. Some
are: The first hospital for Knoxville, parks and play grounds, juvenile court and first refuge for unfortunates. 
I was chairman of the committee that established the Associated Charities, and was one of the founders of the Writers' Club.
In 1910 I organized the first local suffrage association. We had a state suffrage association for many
years, of which I was a member from its inception. I have been state president of the suffrage association,
also of the Federation of Women's Clubs and the first vice-president of the State Parent-Teachers Association.
As soon the legislature gave the women municipal suffrage I organized the Non-Partisan Municipal
League. Mrs. T. P. Miller served as chairman during its active existence and proved a most efficient one.
Because of this league's splendid work, twice as many women were registered to vote in Knoxville in our
first election after enfranchisement as registered in any other southern city.
Several years ago I was elected president of the board of directors of the woman's building, succeeding several presidents who had made a great business success of this woman's enterprise.
Mrs. Geo. F. Mellen only resigned the presidency after all debts had been paid and the building was
self-supporting. This enterprise bears witness that women are successful in business when given the
opportunity to exercise their business ability freely. 
I have given this hasty sketch of my civic work in the past so that citizens may draw their own
conclusions as to whether I would be an efficient and faithful servant should voters place me in the position
of a councilman from the city-at-large.
It is possible for me to give my whole time to the duties of a councilman, as I have no family to look
after, nor any regular business to claim my attention.
I am for every progressive improvement that will tend to make our city a desirable place in which
to live and a great business center, but I shall watch carefully that the means used to this end are practical and not wastefully extravagant.
The public may rest assured that everything that will safeguard the home and give adequate protection to women and children, the weak and unfortunate will receive my hearty  support.
One of the most positive traits of my character is that I will not allow myself to be used by any
ring or clique for personal ends. The righteousness of any proposed measure and the benefit that will
accrue to the public through its enactment must be shown me.
Voters of Knoxville, I ask for your support and promise in return efficient and faithful service.

<dc:description>ANTI-VICE LEAGUERS
AGAINST SEGREGATION
City   Commission   Asked   to
Reverse Its Order as to
Fallen Women.
FORMAL    PETITION    FILED
Mrs. A. H. Dailey and Mrs. L.
Crozier   French Address
Commissioners.

&quot;Speaking as the authorized repre- 
sentative of thirty-three women's or- 
ganizatlons of Knoxville,&quot; Mrs. A. H. 
Dailey appealed to the city commis- 
sioners to &quot;enforce the laws against 
the social evil.&quot; Mrs. L. C. French, 
who accompanied Mrs. Dailey in her
presentations to the city commission, 
argued against the theory of segrega- 
tion of vice, and urged the dissipation
of the evil and of the dual standard
of morality as between men and 
women.
These women addressed the com- 
mission, as a sequel to the enactment 
of an order one week ago instructing 
the police of the city &quot;not to pursue
or prosecute prostitutes, no matter in 
what section, of the city they may be, 
unless they are engaged in some in- 
dependent violation of the law, such 
as profanity, drunkenness, fighting or 
any of the penalties know to the law.&quot; 
They also protested against the 
theories and sentiments expressed in
Mayor Heiskell's two messages to
the commission, in which he treated
of the social evil in Knoxville, and ar- 
gued in favor of a segregated district.
Mrs. Dailey,  who is president of the 
Anti-Vice league of Knoxville  urged
the  commission  to   reconsider  its  action .     She   said   the   legislature     had
declared evil  resorts a mxisance,    the
police of the city  should  not    &quot;inter- 
fere  with  the     nuisance    law.&quot;     She 
argued that segregation is not a rem-
edy for the social evil, and stated that 
homes are ready for all fallen women
who wish to forsake evil.
Mrs. French's address was in the
nature of argument against the principles involved in the two messages
of the mayor. She discussed elementary phases of the social evil, declaring that in the past women were
forced into evil or suffer death, and
that the reason that it has prevailed
has been because men willed that it
should. She urged the downfall of
the double standard of morality for
men and women, and asked why the
men who are guilty should not be
segregated or declared a, nuisance.
Quotations of authorities cited by
Mayor Helskell in his messages were
attacked by Mrs. French. Of that
taken from the Encyclopedia Brit-
tanica she said: &quot;It is but the mere
printed opinion of fallable man, and
is therefore no ultimatum.&quot; As to
quotation that &quot;the elementary laws
upon which prostitution rests are
stronger than the artifical codes imposed by moral teaching, conventional standards, or legislatures,&quot; Mrs.
French said the truth of the matter is
that the social evil &quot;is contrary to
and in violation of every elementary
law.&quot;
Mrs. French seconded the request of
Mrs.  Dailey  in asking the mayor and
commissioners   &quot;to enforce  the  law 
made   by   the   last     state     legislature 
against prostitutes.&quot;
Upon motion of Commisisoner Sam
K. Hill, the address of the ladies was
ordered received, and referred to the
commission in committee of the whole.
The police order was passed a week
ago by Mayor Helskell and Commissioners McTeer and Hensley. Commissioners Flenniken and Hill were
not present at the  meeting.
After the women had presented
their protests Commissioner Hill moved that their communcations be filed
and referred to the commission as a
committee of the whole. This motion
was  accepted.
Commissioner John W. Flenniken,
of the department of streets and public improvements, read a communication in which he urged the commission to consider necessary legislation
in regard to streets and lights, stating that these things should come in
for consideration since other matters
had been considered at length.
He stated that the question of re-
paving Gay street is now ready for
action, and that the problem of bridges
is one of no small proportions, in
which it should be ascertained, said
he, who is responsible for repairs and
erection of new bridges over railroads, whether the railroads, the
Knoxville Railway &amp;. Light company,
or the municipality. He stated that
there is now in the files of the city
a lengthy opinion by the city attorney
on these matters and that action on
them should  be taken  at once.

<dc:description>Mr.   Flenniken   discussed   the   light- 
ing question and  said  that he would 
recommend   that  a  sub-committee  be 
appointed  to    investigate  the    advisability of erecting a municipal lighting   plant     that   citizens   might     get
cheaper light   and power than at present. .
Forty-inine arrests were made by 
the police last week, fines assessed to 
the amount of $510, and $255 collect- 
ed, according to the report of Chief of
Police  Ed. D. Connors.
Chief Sam B. Boyd, of the fire department, reported that three runs
had been made by the fire department.
Commissioner James A. Hensley
submitted the monthly report of the
police department which showed that
356 arrests were made, $2,166.50 in
fines assessed, and $799.15  collected.
The city electrician reported that he
had made thirty-five inspections, and
had issued 18 permits during the
month past.
By motion of Mayor Heiskell the
bill of Pickle, Turner and Kennerly
for service in connection with the
suit brought to retain $24,000 contingent fund set aside at the time of
the purchase of the city waterworks
plant was order paid. The amount
was $568.
It was decided to let out a part of
the work of constructing sewer laterals in the ninth ward connecting
with the Third creek sewer to contractors and Recorder D. G. Leahy
was instructed to advertise for bids.
The cost of the work is estimated at
$1,700.
Repaving of Gay Street
Commissioner John W. Flenniken
stated that as the conduit work on
Gay street would be complete in a
month, and everything in readiness for
the re-Paving of Gay street, the commission should advertise for bids for
work and material, so that the cost
and merits of all could be determined
before action is taken. He made this
as a  motion   which   was   duly   carried.
Mayor Heiskell voting the negative
Recorder Leahy was then instructed
to advertise for bids on all standard
material, to be received until noon
Monday, April 27, when the bids will
be opened.
The budget and tax rate ordinances
which have been held up for, consid-
eration of the commission as a whole
were advanced one reading when they
were brought up by Sam E. Hill
commissioner of finance and accounts
for the second time. Mr. Hill explained that the ordinances will really have to receive four readings, as
they will lie over a week upon the
third reading before passage.
An ordinance granting the Southern
Railway company permission to build
a side track on Campbell street was
passed on second reading. The ordinance providing the kind of paving
to be used on Gay street between car
tracks was passed on its third and
final reading. It provides creosoted
wood  block  paving.
Attention to the proposition made
to the commisison some time ago by
the trustees of the Lawson McGhee
library was renewed by a letter from
the trustees. The proposition was to
erect a $50,000 library building to be
used as a public library  in the same
name as at present, and lease to the
city for a period of ninety-nine years
all the expenses of the operation,
maintenance, etc., to be borne by city
was rejected upon moton of Mayor
Helskell. A motion was carried to invite a committee of the trustees of
the library to meet the commission in
council to discuss further a library
for the city. Mayor Heiskell appoint-
ed a committee composed of Commissioner Hill and McTeer to investigate
the cost of a lot, the cost of erecting a
suitable library building, and all in
connection  with  the matter.

<dc:description>Resolutions Adopted Urge Voters of Knoxville to &quot;Assert
Their Convictions of Right, and Demand the Enforcement
of the Law&quot;—Meeting Was Called to Protest Against
Commission's Order to Police, Preventing Latter From
Arresting Prostitutes, Unless Guilty of Some Other Offense—Dr. J. E. White, of Atlanta, Was the Speaker.
One Thousand Women Were in Attendance.
Taking the initiative in a movement
to secure the enforcement of the law
against segregated vice, a mass meeting
of women was held at Staub's theater
Sunday afternoon. Opening at three
o'clock the meeting continued until nearly five o'clock. Rev. J. E. White, D. D.,
of Atlanta, one of the most prominent
clergymen in the south, delivered the
principal address.  In presenting the
resolutions for adoption by the mass
meeting Mrs. L. Crozier-French made a
few brief remarks. Mrs. A. H. Daiiey,
president of the women's Anti-Vice
league,   presided.
The resolutions adopted are rather
mild in tone, appealing in nature, and
are not bitter toward the city oificials,
against whom they are directed, and
merely set out the grievances of the
women and ask the men of Knoxville
to come to the rescue of mortality and
Christianity that a new order may
dawn.
&quot;Knoxville's Shame.&quot;
Speaking from the general theme of
municipal cleanliness, Dr. White said
that Knoxville's shame is held out before the world. He said that the action of the commissioners of Knoxville
in adopting a measure, restraining tne
police from arresting immoral women
except for &quot;independent&quot; offenses against
the law, is the first instance of the
kind he has ever heard of. Knoxville
is advertised to the world, he said, as
a city inviting prostitution and evil.
The commissioners, he said, went on
record as declaring that they desire as
many violations of the law relative to
prostitution in the residential sections as
possible, and prohibit the police from arresting immoral women, violating the
law in the residential sections, except
when &quot;they shoot a fire cracker&quot; or
commit some other &quot;independent offense.&quot;
Dr. White Introduced.
Mrs. Daiiey called the meeting to order. Mrs. Matthew McClung opened
it   with   a   brief   prayer.
Mrs. Daiiey then introduced Dr.
White, who spoke for over one hour.
His address was eloquent an logical,
driving the points he desired to make
home with oratory that deeply impressed the audience. As he related incidents
of Atlanta's campaign against vice, and
told of the rescue of women of the
underworld from the Atlanta district
when the district was closed two yeais
ago, he brought tears to the majority of
the  eyes  in  the  audience.
In beginning his address, Dr. White
declared that one can and should exercise calmness in a good cause. A good
cause is a good cause on the scaffold
still, and leads to victory. A bad cause
is a bad cause on the throne still, he
said. Therefore, in engaging in a campaign against evil, those so engaged
can well afford to exercise calmness. It
is not such bad cause, he said. Those
so engaged can not exercise calmness,
when assailed,  he  declared.
&quot;The fight against vice is a good
one.&quot; he said. &quot;It is the cause of the
home, the heart of our civilization, manhood and womanhood, the boys and girls,
and the kingdom of God. It is the
cause of purity, patriotism, and the
cane of law and order. He discussed
the cause at length, impressing the fact
upon the audience that the &quot;cause against
the social evil, the liquor traffic and
all other modern public evils is one in
which Christian men and women may
well  enlist.&quot;
Municipal Weakness.
The next part of his address has to
do with municipal life from the history
of the world. History is one long record of the wickedness of cities, he declared. Prophecies have been made,
notably one in 1832 that if America
ever fell, it would be because of the
wickedness of the cities that were to
come. The nation has survived loog
enough, Dr. White said, to prove the
possibility of that prophecy being ful-
filled.
In the earliest ages,  men had dreams
of  fair  cities,  said Dr.   White.       The
ruins today  prove  that   a   city    cannot
survive unless its foundation is on God.
There are only three cities in the
world today, he said, which are ruled,
controlled and dominated by Christianity and Christian men and women, Edinburgh, Toronto and Atlanta. This
remark provoked applause from the audience.
He then told the history of the evolution from evil to good in these three
Cities, each gaining over the former
through the personal efforts of individuals. To Henry W. Grady, Dr. White
gave the credit for starting Atlanta's
evolution when, twenty-five years ago,
he sought to instill morality and Christianity into the fibre of Atlanta and the
people   of  Atlanta.
For several minutes Dr. White discussed Atlanta's successful campaign
for the abolition of the vice district,
paying a tribute to Chief Beavers, of the
Atlanta police department, and holding
him up as a hero of Georgia. &quot;Atlanta
is today controlled by Christian men,
placed in authority by the Christian
forces  of  Atlanta,&quot;  he  declared.
He said that there are not one hundred decent citizens of Atlanta who
now prefer the segregated district over
the present freedom from organized vice.
'Of those who claim to prefer the old
order, said Dr. White, you will find that
they are dominated by some financial
or other connection with the business.
He told of Atlanta's campaign meth-
ods in dealing with the movement, and
of the success the Christian people of
Atlanta have met with in dealing with
other evils, since the accomplishment of
their  anti-vice  victory.
Dominant Liquor Power.
The speaker declared that behind the
social vice and all other vice, is the
liquor power. When you strike the
liquor interests, said Dr. White, you
strike a power with a hand at Washington and at every state capital in the
land. It is a power, he said, that fights
for the millions in wealth it returns to
those interested in it. With this power,
he said, the Christian people of Atlanta
are now dealing.
In dealing with the local situation, he
declared that a single church, with a
united front, has power enough to set
a city on fire.
&quot;The situation in Knoxville,&quot; he said,
&quot;is one in which there ought to be no
doubt how every Christian stands.&quot; The
question involved is larger than the vice
question You will have to shift your
emphasis on the vice question, and make
the paramount question one of law enforcement and civilization. Your commissioners have vacated the law and
have declined to fulfill their oaths of
office. 1 have never heard of an instance like this. I have known lawless
and sinful cities, where the law was ignored and lawlessness reigned, but never
before have sworn officers of the law
published to the world that they hope
the law against prostitution will be violated as much as possible in resident
sections of the city. The police order
they issued invites prostitution, and
prostitutes to come to Knoxville. The
police are restrained from arresting any
prostitute unless she shoots a firecracker
or commits some 'independent' offense.&quot;
Dr. White declared he believed that
the majority of the Knoxville police
force feel and that they are conscious of
the fact that they are being made to
violate their oath of office, and would
prefer to do their duty. On this subject, he said that there isn't a community in the south that wouldn't rally
and stand behind a police officer that
did his duty regardless of orders received
from  those in  authority.
In his closing remarks. Dr. White
discussed the question of segregation.
He said that the question has been thoroughly studied by sociologists, scientists
and government experts, and all have
reached the common verdict that the
segregated district must go and is not
needed. He pointed to Chicago, Minneapolis and other large cities whose
people have driven the segregated districts  from  their borders.
Following Dr. White. Mrs. French
presented the resolution. She bespoke
the co-operation of every Christian woman in Knoxville in the campaign for the
riddance   of   social   vice  from   the   city.
The resolutions she presented, and
which were unanimously adopted by rising vote,  are  as  follows:—
The Resolutions.
Whereas, the position taken by
the city commissioners of Knoxville
at the instigation of Mayor Heis-
kell, through his special message in
regard to the nuisance law, is an insult to the womanhood of our city,
and.
&quot;Whereas, the city commissioners
have ignored the repeated appeals
our women that they enforce the
law. and.
&quot;Whereas,   the  women  of  Knox-
ville have no method of redress except  through   the  manhood   of our
city,
&quot;Therefore, be it resolved by t(missing)
mass   meeting  of  women  that   t(missing)
voters of  Knoxville are hereby u(missing)
gently requested to assert their con-
victions   of  right,   and  demand  the
enforcement  of     the  law,  or  take
such legal steps  as may  be necessary  to secure this end.
&quot;Second,   that   we   deeply   regret
that the state of affairs in our city
should   necessitate   this   action on
the part of women.&quot; Following the adoption of the re(missing)
tious,   cards  with     pledges    printe(missing)

<dc:description>Concerning    Remark   Said   to
Have Been Made by University Professor in Lecture.
It is here stated that Mrs. French
wrote an article complimenting the professor's lecture and here it is implied
that three years later she, with others,
made charges so enormous against him as
to be unbelievable.
I have read in the paper the report
of the lecture. There is no name signed
I have no recollection of having written
it and I do not think it is my style.
But let that pass. I objected at the
time of the lecture so much to some
opinions expressed that I stopped the
speaker and asked him a question with
the hope of hinting to him that he was
speaking imprudently. He did not take
the hint. Immediately on the close of
his lecture I went up to him and tried
to show him my disapproval of a part
of  his  conclusions.
A verdict has been rendered against
myself and several other ladies by a
committee—a verdict which by insinuation and implication reflects upon our
veracity and our having sympathy for
a  fellow-being.
I propose to write to the gentlemen of
this committee informing them that all
the facts of the case against these ladies
and myself were not laid before them
and that I demand a rehearing and that
we be faced with those who furnished
the material upon which the committee
based their report, which did us such injustice.
L. CROZIER-FRENCH.

<dc:description>TENNESSEE FIGHT
UNSETTLED BY
COMMITTEE
Although the special committee appoint-
ed by Dr. Shaw to consider the merits of
the claims of the delegate from Tennessee appointed to the national convention
by Mrs. Crozier-French and those appointed by Mrs. James McCormick was in
secret session at the Hotel Hermitage at
an early hour this morning they had been
unable to reach a decision as to which
faction was entitled to seats on the floor
of the convention.
The Crozier-French delegates were seated Thursday in the preliminary report of
the credentials committee brought in by
Mrs. Stanley McCormick, chairman of the
committee, but objection was immediately
offered to the report by Miss Erwin of
Chattanooga. Miss Irwin is one of the
delegates appointed by Mrs. James McCormick. Miss Kate Gordon of Louisiana
demanded that the respective claims of the
two contesting delegations be referred to
a special committee. This committee was
appointed by Dr. Shaw and they took up
the investigation immediately after the
night session at the Ryman auditorium.
The contest between the two opposing
factions in the Tennessee association dates
back to the resignation of Miss Elliott as
president of the state organization and
the subsequent election of Mrs. Crozier-
French, which the faction headed by Mrs.
James McCormick has claimed was entirely
irregular.    The first  break  in   the  ranks
of the Tennessee association took (missing)
in the spring of this year, but reached (missing)
actual split at the Knoxville convention,
when the two factions held conventions
in the hall independent of each other and
selected the two sets of delegates to the
national convention.
So complicated is the history of the rupture in the state association that it was the
opinion of many prominent national suffragists in close touch with the phases of
the case Thursday night that the special
committee appointed by Dr. Shaw would
be unable to decide which of the two opposing factions was entitled to seats in
the conventions and would in all probability refer the matter back to the convention.
It was learned from an authoritative
source that the personnel of the committee
would not permit of the possibility of a
compromise being reached, thereby agreeing to seat certain delegates from each
faction  in  an  effort  to  restore  harmony.
The delegates appointed by Mrs. Crozier.
French who were declared accredited dele-
gates to the convention in the credentials
committee's report brought in by Mrs.
Stanley  McCormick,  are as follows:
Mrs. Isaac Reece of Memphis, Mrs. John
M. Kenny, Mrs. Guilford Dudley, Mrs.
Joseph J. Roach, Mrs. Reau Folk and Miss
Emma Spencer, all of Nashville; Mrs. Fred
Jones of Chattanooga, Miss Sarah Rutherford and Miss Ada Fanz of Knoxville,
and Miss Sue White of Jackson.

<dc:description>OSSOLI MOVES
AGAINST SMOKE
Mrs.  L C. French Writes
To Women Of Knoxville.
Constitutional   League    Extends Invitation To Housewives To Join Crusade.
Ossoli Circle has inaugurated a
movement to abate the smoke nuisance in Knoxville and Mrs. E. Crozier French, members of Ossoli Circle, and chairman of the Constitutional league has addressed the following open letter to the citizens of
Knoxville, men and women, asking
their co-operation in bringing this
matter to a successful conclusion:
&quot;For many years the housewives
of Knoxville have uttered complaints
loud and long about the soot and
smoke that has been permitted to
invade their homes, destroying
ruthlessly their clothes and household furnishings, multiplying many
times the labor of housecleaning
and the cost of the laundry bill.
&quot;Many have said to me &quot;Please
start a movement to abate soot and
smoke and we will help&quot;
'Women of Knoxville, how many
of vou will make good an join in the
crusade just started by Ossoli Circle
to work for a purer atmosphere that
will conduce to greater cleanliness,
and better health?
&quot;The   civic   committee     of    Ossoli
went   before     the     commission     on
Tuesday  morning  and asked for an
ordnance that would require factories and engines to    consume    their
own  smoke.  The reply of the  commission  was  that   if     some    device
could be found that would abate this
nuisance   without   working   a   great
hardship  on  factory    owners,    they
would consent to act in the matter.
&quot;I   herebv   extend     an     invitation 
from  the   Constitutional   league     to
Knoxville citizens, women and men,
to  meet with   this  society     at     the 
Woman's building Wednesday afternoon at 3 o'clock to hear a proposition made by one who has success- 
fully put in operation soot and smoke
destroyers.
&quot;General discussion of the ways
and means of bringing about the
purifying of our atmosphere will be
called for, and it is believed that
much will be accomplished if the
people will get behind this movement
and push with all their might. How
many will help?
(Signed)
&quot;L. Crozier French,
&quot;Chairman,   Constitutional   League.&quot;

<dc:description>As soon as the legislature gave the women municipal suffrage I organized the
Non-Partisan Municipal League. Mrs. T. P. Miller served as chairman during its active
existence and proved a most efficient one. Because of this league's splendid work,
twice as many women were registered to vote in Knoxville in our first election after
enfranchisement as registered in any other southern city.
Several years ago I was elected president of the board of directors of the woman's building, succeeding several presidents who had made a great business success of this
woman's enterprise,
Mrs. Geo. F. Mellen only resigned the presidency after all debts had been paid
and the building was self-supporting. This enterprise bears witness that women are successful in business when given the opportunity to exercise their business ability freely.
I have given this hasty sketch of my civic work in the past so that citizens may
draw their own conclusions as to whether I would be an efficient and faithful servant
should voters place me in the position of a councilman from the city-at-large.
It is possible for me to give my whole time to the duties of a councilman, as I
have no family to look after, nor any regular business to claim my attention.
I am for every progressive improvement that will tend to make our city a desirable place in which to live and a great business center, but I shall watch carefully that
the means used to this end are practical and not wasfully extravagant.
The public may rest assured that everything that will safeguard the home and give
adequate protection to women and children, the weak and unfortunate will receive my
hearty support. 
One of the most positive traits of my character is that I will not allow myself to be
used by any ring or clique for personal ends. The righteousness of any proposed measure and the benefit that will accrue to the public through its enactment must be shown
me.
Voters of Knoxville, I ask for your support and promise in return efficient and
faithful service.
L. CROZIER FRENCH
(Adv.)

called by this organization, the at-
endance has not been large, and
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president of

<dc:description>ASK PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE TO ABATE IT                                                                                                                                       All Women of City Invited To Go To Women's
Building Wednesday.
The   city   commission   Tuesday
promised a committee from Ossoli
Circle  to   &quot;consider&quot;  the  passage
of an ordinance to eliminate the
smoke nuisance.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, chairman of the Ossoli committee,
urged the passage of the ordinance
and submitted to the commission
a copy of the Louisville smoke
prevention ordinance.
Commissioner Adams said he
would be willing to vote for such
an ordinance if convinced it would
really prove effective. He suggested that the commission communicate with other cities to learn
the methods adopted to prevent
smoke and whether or not successful.
Mayor Neal said this would be
done. He said he was not familiar with the use of smoke consumers.
Commissioner Wayland said
much of the smoke came from
railroad engines.
&quot;I doubt if we could compel
them to put on smoke consumers,&quot; said Mayor Neal.
Mrs. French invited all women
of the city to attend a meeting of
the Constitutional League at the
Woman's-bldg Wednesday at 3 p.
m., to discuss smoke prevention.

<dc:description>CITIZENSHIP CLASS
WORK COMPLIMENTED
Mrs. L. C. French, in her official
capacity as chairman of the good
citizenship class which is conducted
every Thursday afternon at 3
o'clock at the Lawson McGhee li-
brary has just received a letter
from the head, of the Welfare de
partment of one of the large coal
companies commenting upon te
work of the class. The letter is as
follows: &quot;I notice from the papers that
you are still conducting the classes
in Good Citizenship, and I wanted
to write and tell you how very important I think this is. Recent
events have shown this. The election of superintendent of city schools 
for example. I do not believe you 
could make a better contribution to
the times, or serve in a better way
that to help develop the naturally
public spirited side of women. My
experience of five years as social
service worker has shown me this
In fact it seems to me the men need
some such help as much as we do
I hope much from the advent of
women into public affairs, and your
classes will, I feel sure further this (rest is missing)

<dc:description>GOOD CITIZENSHIP CLASS
TO HOLD CALLED MEETING
It had been decided that the class in
citizenship would not meet in April, but
the decision of the supreme court on
April 9, on the legality of the ratification of the 19th amendment of the federal constitution by the Tennessee legislature and the passage by this legislature of several laws of special interest to women, has, in the opinion of the
chairman made a meeting this week almost imperative.
Thursday at the Lawson McGhee library, promptly at 3 o'clock. The meeting will be held and the following resolution submitted to the class:
&quot;In commemoration of the making of
the Volunteer state the 'perfect thirty-
six' of the union, it is recommended
that April 9th be celebrated in Tennessee as Citizens' day.&quot;
All interested in state laws are invited
to attend.

<dc:description>TO ABATE SMOKE
IF FUEL SAVED
Dads Favor It If Coal  Is
Saved.
Mrs. French's   Request For
Action Taken Under
Advisement.
Whether or not the city commission will pass an ordinance requiring factories in the city to equip
their standpipes with smoke consumers or their furnaces with smoke
abaters, in compliance with the request of Mrs. L. C. French, representing an Ossoli circle committee,
will depend on whether or not the
smoke eliminators will save fuel for
the companies.
  N.  B.  Kuhlman.   commissioner  of
public  safety,  announced  he  would
not vote on such an ordinance unless a saving was instituted by the
consumers. It is understood tha[t]
the other members of the commission agree with Commissioner Kuhlman on this point.
Mrs. French, in addressing her request to the commission, stated the
abaters would save fuel. The commission will send to other cities
where smoke ordinances are in effect
to secure copies of the measures and
information regarding the efficiency
of such a law.
If the plan is found feasible, it is
expected  the  commission  will   pass
such an ordinance.   A mass meeting
of women will be held today in the
Woman's building, under the auspices of the Constituional league, to
discuss the smoke question from all
angles and a further appeal may be
made to the commission. It will
probably be several weeks before
the commission acts on the project.

<dc:description>An &quot;Open letter&quot; to the Ring.
A  publication   has recently  made    its
appearance in    Knoxville    called    &quot;The
People.&quot;   Its editor and manager is Mrs.
L. Crozier French.   Mrs.  French is well
known to the people of Knoxville and to
many throughout the state and country,
as a woman of extraordinary ability, and
her courage  is no less  pronounced than
her ability is apparent.   She has a habit 
of speaking out on things in  which she
takes an interest, and doing it in such a
way  that the  services of  an interpreter
are not necessary to tell what she means.
Consequently &quot;The People&quot; is sure to be
read.    It is a monthly, and the first issue is before us.   In it we find &quot;An Open
Letter,&quot; addressed to some of the gentlemen believed by many to be allied with a
political  ring in  this  county.   Following
is the open letter:
Messrs. Cateses, McTeers, McMillins and
Others:
Sirs—Common report says you are the
manipulators of a Ring that was placed
in the nose of the dear people some years
ago and that by means of this Ring,
You &amp; Co. have been driving us wither-
so-ever ye would's ever since.
Now I am one of the People and I
seriously object to being led about by
Judge, Attorney-General, Sheriff, Tax
Collector, or even the Lord Mayor himself.
The League, I am told, is taking measures to break this ring and set the People—I was going to say free, but I hesitate to utter the word in this connection,
because it is just possible that the League
may only have the intention of breaking
your ring in order to insert one of its
own manufacture.
If I understand rightly the meaning
of the word ring one kind is no way superior to another be it gold, silver, copper, lead or iron.
A Ring is composed of those who say,
&quot;I want to get a certain thing or pass
a certain measure which it is not to
the interest of the people at large; now
if you will help me hoodwink, bulldoze
and coerce the People into letting me
have this, I will help you to get from
them, by fair means or foul, anything
that you may want.&quot;
Now such organizations or understandings exist not only in politics, but in
churches, school affairs, and clubs of all
sorts even in those of women. So, if you
gentlemen do compose a Ring I do not
know that you are any worse than the
average man or woman.
Now the Ring fever is a disease that
has made no inroads into my constitution
and consequently I feel myself peculiarly
fitted to make the attempt to eradicate
it from the system of the multitude.
Of my knowledge I do not know that
you gentlemen belong to a Ring. The
purpose of this letter is to ask you to
answer the simple question: Do you?
Have any of you, in even a remote degree, had anything to do with practicing
fraud at the polls?
Do you truly believe in the democratic
doctrine of the right of the majority to
rule?
If  none  of  you   have   ever  interfered
with  the  rights  of the majority to   ex
press  at the polls their  choice for can
didates, will you say  as much before  
notary public and send the certificate, t[o]
me to publish in the next issue of The
People?   For I think it a perfect shame
that innocent men should be talked about
as  you  gentlemen  are talked  about    by
the'peopie at large.   You, who are, some
of you,    deacons    and    elders    in     the
churches,  who  have wives and  children
who   must   be   greatly   wounded   by  the
malicious  abuse,  of which  you  may be
the innocent victims.
The People proposes to undertake the
defense of the maligned and I fell that
your cas'e should be speedily set right or
great injury may come upon you.
Yours to command,
EDITOR &quot;THE PEOPLE.&quot;

<dc:description>SMOKE NUISANCE TO BE CURTAILED  Constitutional    League    Will
Prosecute Campaign  For
Abatement of Evil
BUY    STOCK    IN    PROJECT
Ossoli Circle Expected to Help
in Selling of Shares—Try
Device Here Soon
Solution of the smoke abatement
problem for Knoxville was guaranteed yesterday when a group of ladies
at a meeting of the Constitutional
league took ten shares of stock and
pledged themselves to raise the additional ninety shares necessary before   a   certain   type   of   smoke  con-
sumer can be introduced here. 
Within three weeks time one of the
appliances will be in operation at the
Knoxville Pure Milk company,
through the permission of its owner
and persons interested in the experiment are invited to see it.
If the consumer proves to be satisfactory it is expected that the city
will pass an ordinance compelling
factories, mills, etc. to protect the city
from smoke by installing these consumers. The city commission recently expressed its favor of such ordinance, provided a satisfactory appliance should be found, and the expense
to the mill or factory owner was not
too great.
Neal B. Spahr, assistant city attorney, represented the city yesterday at
the meeting. At its close he admitted
that the appliance as explained by Mr.
John Morton, president of the fuel
saving company which manufactures
it &quot;looked like a good thing.&quot;
Ossoli circle, the organization which
started the movement by appearing
before the city commission, will take
up the matter further at its meeting
Monday and probably assist in disposing of the shares of stock.
The ladies were most enthusiastic
and greatly interested in getting
smoke abatement, as an aid to good
health and domestic economy. Ten
shares of stock were bought by them
within a few minutes. Ten other
shares sold yesterday to certain business men in the city further reduced the remaining number to be secured to 80.
Mr. Morton explained in detail how
the appliance is worked and quoted
figures to show that far from being a
burden in the way of expense, it actually saves coal because of the heat
which it generates.
Mr. Spahr stated that he thought
the city could force the railroad to
put smoke consumers on all switch
engines, and possibly all trains that
run through Knoxville. It was pointed out that two-thirds of the city's
smoke comes from engines.
Private homes will not be expected
to have smoke consumers, however,
Mr. Morton stated that by a careful
selection of the grade of coal burned,
much of the smoke in the residential
sections could he eliminated.

<dc:description>Mrs. L Crozier French Stands
For Protection Of City's Weak
Mrs.   L.   Crozier French,  woman's 
candidate for council at large, is in
for every progressive movement that
will tend to make Knoxville a desirable place to live and a greater business center, she declared yesterday
in announcing her platform. She
also declared that she is for adequate protection for women and children, support for the weak and unfortunate and a city government
that achieves its purpose without
waste or extravagance.
Another plea Mrs. French makes
for support is that she has no other
thing to occupy her and can devote
full time to the city's service.
Mrs. French has been active in
public life of Knoxville for many
years, having been the founder of
Ossoli Circle and other civic clubs
designed for the city's betterment.
Her experience also extends into
educational and uplift fields, where
she has worked untiringly.
Mrs.  French says  she  is    in    the race in response to urgent  requests
from her friends that she is to take 
up the women's cause in the election
and carry  it through.

<dc:description>NEAL CHARGES ORGY OF DEBT	
Accuses City Administration of
Weird Financing,
Declares    Floating Debt Now
Nearly $1,000,000—Alleges
Fraud Planned For Primary.
Charging that the present city administration has created a floating debt of
nearly a million dollars, besides increasing the bonded debt of Knoxville a million and a half dollars, E. W. Neal fired
the first heavy artillery of his campaign for mayor at a meeting of Eleventh ward voters at the Broadway Baptist church last night.
Thirteen candidates for city commissioner addressed the same meeting, as
did Mrs. L. Crozier French, who presided, and J. G. Johnson, the last two urging women to qualify to vote.
Despite the fact that they were limited to six minutes each, there was
more meat in what the candidates for
commissioner said at this meeting than
at any other public gathering held previously in the campaign. But the greatest interest was created by the speech
of Mr, Neal, who was granted additional time and spoke for 30 minutes.
Mr. Neal appeared with a copy of a
report on city finances submitted to
him by an accountant he employed to
go over the city records. He promised
a more full statement of that report at
some later occasion, when he could have
more time.
Declaring that if he had known the
condition of the city finances beforehand, he never would have announced
for mayor, because the task of refinancing the city would prove a tremendous
strain, Mr. Neal declared that if every
cent of the taxes assessed in Knoxville
for this fiscal year were to be collected, they would lack some $100,000 of
paying the floating debt alone.
&quot;I believe in progress,&quot; said Mr. Neal,
&quot;But I do not believe in this kind 'progress' and I think we should have some
idea of where money is coming from
before we spend it.&quot;
Nearly Million Floting [Floating] Debt.
Mr. Neal charged that when Mayor
McMillan went into office as chief executive of Knoxville, there was $22,518
owed in the current account and that
there was $97,000 to the city's credit in
the bank, a surplus over indebtedness
of about $75,000. He charged that on
June 30, last, there was owed $946,401,
with only $87,000 in the bank, nearly $1,-
000,000 difference on the wrong side of
the ledger in three years and eight
months.
Bonded indebtedness has increased
$1,500,000, he declared, many improvements having been made from bond issues and not from tax money received. He excluded in these figures the
water department, which is a separate
account. In connection with the water
department, Mr. Neal declared there
was an item of $204,768 on the books
charged to &quot;extraordinary expenses&quot; 
without further explanation. 
Mr. Neal charged that money has 
been transferred from one account to 
another; that money from bond issues 
has been spent for other purposes and
repaid later by money secured on notes. 
&quot;Why, the money for the Gay street .
viaduct has already been spent,&quot; he 
declared. &quot;At least there is nothing ,
shown on the bond account on the
date this audit was made.&quot;
Mr. Neal charged that the city has
borrowed so heavily from local banks
that they could lend no more and that
the administration had the last legislature pass an act enabling it to borrow
outside the state and that $190,000 or
more has been borrowed from New York
banks since that time. The interest account, he declared, is running at the
rate of $20,000 a year more than when
the present administration went into office.
Says Fraud is Planned.
Despite all this, Mr. Neal said, the
tax rate has been raised 35 cents.
Urging all decent people to register
and vote, Mr. Neal charged that negroes
are being imported and registered in
two or three precincts to be voted in
the coming election. He said he had
proof of this but did not name the person he holds responsible for this alleged condition.
If elected, Mr. Neal promised to have
regular office hours at the city hall
and that he would devote his attention
to the people's business and give a
business administration and try hard to
get itihe city out of its &quot;staggering load
of debt.&quot;
Dr. A. D. Albright, Neal Adams. Ben
S. Boyd, Major E. G. Cooper, Creed F.
Copeland, Hal H. Clements, Ed Gillen
waters, Nathan B. Kuhlman, John T
O'Connor, C. C. Popejoy, W. B. Richards, Roscoe Word and C. G. Wayland,
candidates for city commissioner, spoke
in the order named. All received an attentive hearing.
About 200 persons, the majority of
whom were women, attended the meeting.

<dc:description>TRUSTEES OF
UNIVERSITY
Hear Reports and Fill Faculty
Vacancies.
Decide to  Continue Summer
School Another Year.
Dr.  Stough Not Warranted in
Making   Charges Against
Prof. A. A. Schaeffer.
That Rev. Henry W. Stough, the evangelist, who conducted a campaign in this
city, was in no way warranted in the
statement he made concerning Prof. A.
A. Schaeffer, of the University of Tennessee, and that the evangelist should
have withdrawn these statements as soon
as he saw the letters that were furnished
by him to the trustees of the university, was the sense of the special committee of the university trustees which
took this matter under advisement at
the meeting of the board of trustees held
on Tuesday, at the university. The trustees of the university unanimously adopt-
ed   the  report  of  its  committee.
The meeting of Wednesday was attended by Governor Thomas 0. Rye, Commissioner of Agriculture Bryson and the
largest out of town attendance that has
ever been noted at the meetings of the
board. It was featured by a decision to
continue the Summer school next year at
least, by the election of a number of
professors, and by the annual hearing of
reports. The finances of the institution
remain practically as they were last year,
The meeting was held in the office of
the president, Dr. Brown Ayres, with
the following trustees present;—
Judge Hu G. Kyle, of Rogersville: H.
Clay Evans, of Chattanooga; Hon. W. P,
Cooper, of Shelbyville, former speaker of
the house of representatives; Mr. J. Ew-
ing Hite, of Gallatin; Spencer F.
Thomas, of Brownsville; Rowan A.
Greer, Bolton Smith and James S. Robertson, all of Memphis; I. B. Tigert, of
Jackson; Governor T. C. Rye, Commissioner of Agriculture Bryson, President
Ayres, Judge Hu L. McCkmg, James
Maynard, Sr., of Knoxville. Mr. Hite
had been reappointed, and Messrs Cooper
and Robinson being new members, the
statutory oath was administered by
Judge Hu G. Kyle.
President Ayres read his annual report
showing that the university had passed
through   its   most   prosperous   year.    It
showed the    grand total    of    student[s]
taught &quot;in our buildings in the regu[lar]
session was 1,278, being an increase [of]
108 over the preceding year,&quot;    The [num]-

<dc:description>Mrs. French asks The Journal and Tri
bune to publish her letter to the executive
committee of the University of Tennessee,
because the verdict of the special committee reflecting upon her veracity and
consistency of conduct has not only been
published in the public press, but is a part
of the record of the state university that
must go down to posterity. Mrs. French
asks the public to give her their help in
her efforts to have this unjust verdict ex
punged from the record.
To   the   Executive   Committee   of   the  University   of  Tennessee.
Gentlemen:—In the published report of
the meeting of the trustees of the university, I call your attention to the resolution
of a special committee under the heading
&quot;The  Stough   Case.&quot;
In the summing up of this case in the
last paragraph but one, my name is conspicuously used as one of several ladies
who it is implied are in some way re
sponsible for Dr. Stough's attack upon the
teaching of a professor of the university.
I wish to brand this finding of your special committee as a gross slaader of these
ladies and myself, hence I write to demand|
a re-hearing—not of the &quot;Stough Case,'
his case being no concern of mine, but of
the verdict against the ladies and myself
that we are guilty of making charges
against said professor that cannot be sub 
stantiated when we have not been given
the opportunity of defense before the body
that tried  and  convicted  us.
An early reply is solicited as to when I
may be allowed the privilege which is al
ways given the lowest criminal, of defending myself against a verdict which brands
me as guilty of conduct unbecoming any
self-respecting woman.
Yours for justice,
L.   CROZIER   FRENCH.
Knoxville,  Tenn., July 29, 1916.

<dc:description>The Stough Charges.
On motion of Mr. Maynard, a committee of the board not residents of
Knoxville, was appointed, and the case
of the professor, charged by Rev. H.
W. Stough with teaching immorality to
his classes, to examine the record and report their finding to the board, with their
recommendations in the premises. The
committee named was Bolton Smith, of
Memphis; H. Clay Evans, of Chattanooga and Hon. W. P. Cooper, speaker
of the Tennessee house of representatives, of Bedford county. After fully
considering all the correspondence in the
case, and all evidence the committee
made the following report, which was
unanimously adopted:—
&quot;Your committee having read the statement of Reverend Dr. Stough, and the
correspondence with him, as well as the
statements of Mrs. McGranahan, Mrs.
Knox, Mrs. Dodson. Mrs. Crafts and
Mrs. French, furnished by him, and subsequent correspondence with these ladles
from the president of the university, finds
that Dr. Stough's statements are in no
sense supported by the letters furnished
by him, and we feel that he should have
withdrawn his statements as soon as he
saw these letters.
&quot;Having examined the newspaper re-
port of the lecture of Professor Schaeffer
in The Knoxville Journal and Tribune of
June 20, 1913, prepared by Mrs. L. Cro-
zier-French, we feel warranted in relying upon the latter, written when the
lecture was fresh in mind, rather than
on the former statements prepared three
years later. We do not in the least suggest that the ladies' statements are not
the result of an absolute desire to be fair
to Professor Shhaeffer, but merely that
the report of Mrs. French, being commendatory in tone, is incompatible with
the belief that the statements now alleged were in fact in her mind when the
article for the paper was written. When
to this was added the denial of Professor
Schaeffer, that he ever held or expressed
such an opinion, and the denial of Pro-
fessorf (sic.) J. C. Pridmore, Miss Ruby
Franklin and Mrs. J. C. Pridmore, who
were present at the lecture, that any such
statements were made, we feel the accusation of these ladies to have been disproved as conclusively as it is possible to
disprove statements made after the lapse
of three years.
&quot;Besides, the charges are so enormous
that we could not find any man of clean
life guilty  of them unless  the evidence were conclusive, and no one can claim
this to be true in this case.
(Signed)
 &quot;BOLTON SMITH, Chairman.
&quot;H. CLAY EVANS

<dc:description>WOMEN AND CITY
POLITICS TOPIC
Mrs. L. Crozier French Will Address Morristown Club Feb.
22 On Important Subject
&quot;Activities of Women in the Problems of a City Government,&quot; will be
the subject of an address to be delivered by Mrs. L. Crozier French, president of Ossoli circle at the citizenship
day program of Somo Sala circle, February 22, at Morristown. This will be
the leading address of the day; other
five minute talks being given by different members as follows:
&quot;Types of City Government.&quot;
&quot;Mayor and Council Type&quot;—Mrs.
Harris.
&quot;Commission Forb&quot;—Mrs. Witt.
&quot;City Manager Plan&quot;—Mrs. Phillips.
The theme for the subjects under
discussion is suggested by the quotation from Lowell which heads the
program:
&quot;New occasions teach new duties;
Time makes ancient good uncouth.&quot;
The Morristown club is greatly interested in a practical solution of some
of the problems which face every community, and hopes to follow up the
discussions by some action that shall
result in permanent good to all concerned. It is particularly fortunate in
securing as a speaker Mrs. L. Crozier
French who is one of Knoxville's most
active and brilliant club women, and
who has been for some time at the head
of Ossoli circle.

<dc:description>An Open Letter To The Knox
County Election Commission.
Gentlemen:
It has been announced that your
commission has instructed registrars
to compel women to give their exact
age when applying for a registration  certificate.
It is the purpose of this communication to ask you to give your
reason to the public for giving such
instruction.
It is most probable that many
are as much puzzled as I am, as to
the necessity or advisability of such
an interpretation of the election law.
I hope that it is not due to mental
weakness that I cannot think of one
single reason why registrars should
know the exact age of any one who
applies for a certificate to vote. The
registrar must have reason to believe that the applicant has arrived
at the legal age, twenty-one, which
is required by our state law of every voter. Why should the registrar
know anything more as regards the
age of applicants?
One of the commission is reported
as saying, &quot;The women now have
got into politics and they must be
reconciled to complying with all requirements.&quot; If the requirement is
one which in no way promotes the
interest of the public but is most
displeasing to many electors, why
should they obey it? I have not the
election law to which to refer, but
I venture to say it is not the intent of that law to pry into the
private personal affairs of electors.
Every elector should resist, by endeavoring to have changed, any law
which approaches tyranny even
though it involves so small a matter as  the exact age of the voter.
You are not compelled to put a
tyrannical construction on this law,
why do so?
MRS.   L.   C.   FRENCH.

<dc:description>UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR DEFENDED DOUBLE MORAL
CODE, SAYS MRS. FRENCH
Suffragist Leader Charges Instructor Schaeffer With Having
Said Woman is More to Blame in Delinquencies Than the
Man—Answers Resolution Published by Daily Papers That
Reflected on Veracity of Ladies Who Heard Educator Lecture in 1913.
Editor of The Voice of Labor:
When Dr. Stough was in Knoxville
he heard through a second party a
remark made by a lady that a certain
professor of the University of Tennessee had said that he, the professor,
believed in a double standard of morals. Whereupon Dr. Stough made an
attack upon the university. The executive committee demanded his authority. The lady whose remark was
the cause of the attack telephoned me
and asked me if I would stand by her
in her statement. I replied that I
would and I did, so did three other
ladies.
When the trustees met a resolution
exonerating the professor and reflecting upon the ladies' veracity was passed and published in the daily papers.
I wrote a protest, stating the truth
of the whole case. The Journal and
Tribune and the Sentinel refused to
publish this.
As your paper wears no muzzle, I
am taking the liberty of asking that
you will be so kind as to give us ladies the opportunity in your columns
to defend ourselves against this great
injustice that has been done us. I ask
you to publish my bill of complaint
addressed to the legislative educational committee which lately visited
the university, composed of the fol-
lowing members of the
general assembly: Messrs. Rooks,
Mathews, Cameron, Kittrell and De
Priest.        L. CROZIER-FRENCH.
A Bill of Complaint.
Addressed to the committee appointed by the legislature to investigate the
eduactional institutions of the state.
By Mrs. L. Crozier-French, Knoxville,
Tenn.
Honorable Sirs:—At the last meeting of the board of trustees of the
University of Tennessee a resolution
was passed which reflects upon the
veracity and integrity of the conduct
of several ladies of Knoxville, myself
among the number. I copy the resolution from the Journal and Tribune
of a July, 1916, issue, as follows:
&quot;Having examined the newspaper
report of the lecture of Prof. Schaeffer in the Knoxville Journal and Tribune of June 20, 1913, prepared by
Mrs. L. C. French, we feel warranted
in relying upon the latter written
when the lecture was fresh in mind,
rather than upon the former statements prepared three years later. We do not in the least suggest that the ladies' statements are not the result of an absolute desire to be fair to Prof. Schaeffer, but merely the report of Mrs. French being commendatory in tone is incompatible with the belief that that the statements now alleged were in fact in her mind when the article for the paper was written.When to this was added the denial of Prof. Schaeffer that he ever held or expressed such an opinion and the deniual of Prof. J.C. Pridmore, Miss Ruby Franklin and Mrs. J.C. Pridmore, who were present at the lecture, that any such statement was made, we feel the accusation of these ladies to have been disproved as conclusively as it is possible to disprove statements made after the lapse of three years. Besides, the statements are so enormous that we could not find any man of clean life guilty of them unless the evidence were conclusive and no one can claim this to be (missing).
Though the daily papers published
the resolution condemning the ladies,
the Journal and Tribune and the Sentinel refused to publish my statement
of the whole case.
Enclosed please find the following
papers which I submit to you for your
consideration.
By Mrs. L. Crozier-French, letter to
the executive committee, a protest to
the special committee, letter to trustees, letter from M. E. church, South,
statement by Prof. Schae:er (sic.) before
trustees and letters from Dr. Ayres.
Respectfully submitted.
(Signed) L. CROZIER-FRENCH.
Knoxville, Tenn., Feb. 12, 1917.
Letter to Committee. '
To the special committee, appointed
by the trustees of the Unixersity (sic.) of
Tennessee to act upon the Stough case.
Messrs. Bolton Smith, H. Clay Evans
and W. P. Cooper.
Gentlemen:—In the Knoxville Journal and Tribune of July 25 is published a resolution signed by you that reflects upon the veracity of several ladies, myself among the number. The
implication is there made that we were
in part responsible for, and involved
with Dr. Stough in an attack made
upon the character of the teaching of
 a Professor of the University of Tennessee, your statement in part is, &quot;the
charges are so enormous that we
could not find any man of clean life
guilty of them unless the evidence
were conclusive and no one can claim
this to be true in this case.&quot; Mesdames
Knox, Dobson, McGrannahan, Graft
and myself are named as having given
this evidence, I am writing to you to
say that this is a base slander upon
these respectable women. We furnished absolutely no evidence upon which
Dr. Stough could be justified in making charges &quot;so enormous that no man
of clean life could be guilty of them.&quot;
Just here I wish to emphasize the
fact that no one could possibly disapprove more of the public attack of Dr.
Stough against the professor and the
university than I do. Hence it seems
most unjust that I should be put conspicuously forward as either his aider,
abettor or informer. Yet my alleged
action is made the basis upon which
your decision is given which exonerates the professor and reflects upon
the veracity, intelligence and discression of myself and others.
Your honorable committee will note
 that  the  basis    upon    which    Prof.
Schaeffer is acquitted and the five la-
dies accused of propogating an enor-
mous charge against an innocent man
is the statement that Mrs. French
wrote a complimentary article about
Prof. Schaefter's lecture in the Journal and Tribune. I pronounce this
statement utterly false. I have never
written at any time any complimentary article of Prof. Schae:er (sic.) or his
lecture.  When  I  saw  this  statement in the paper I telephoned to Dr. Ayres 
to know upon what authority the com- 
mittee made the assertion that I had 
written a complimentary article of 
the lecture of Prof. Schaeffer. He re- 
plied upon the authority of Prof. 
Schaeffer, and he added, &quot;We thought 
you had done it because it was so well expressed.&quot;                                                                                                                      Upon this flimsy testimony the committee based their decision without attempting to prove the truth of the assertion.
Denial of &quot;Compliment-&quot;
Your resolution states that Mrs. L
Crozier-French wrote a complimentary
article of a lecture of the professor
delivered on June 19, 1913, and in 1916
she made contrary statements. The
evidence upon which you make this
charge against me was furnished you
by said Professor. I pronounce this
evidence false. I wrote no article complimentary of the lecture and I did
verbally condemn in no uncertain
terms that part of the lecture treating of prostitution. I took issue with
the professor himself during the delivery of the lecture in order to give
him a hint that he was touching on
dangerous ground. For he was ad-
dressing an anti-vice league composed
of women organized for the purpose
of helping the churches to do away
with the segregated district and to
furnish homes for the inmates of
 houses to be closed. He said during
his lecture it was useless to work for
the breaking up of prostitution, that
as far back as any record of peoples
existed this institution had been maintained in all countries of the world
and that it always would continue.
That the prostitute was such because
of her heredity and that she could not
escape from that destiny. I interrupted the professor here to ask if he
did not think many young girls
through ignorance or innocence or because of violence were reduced to so
low a social position that they could
not rise, and in consequence were
forced to join the professional class
of unfortunates? He said no doubt
there were some such, but very few.
Double Standard.
I had been so accustomed during
thirty years of public work to hear
men claim that man's necessities caused this condition of a permanent class
of women to be sacrificed, that I could
not help but suspect that the professor
held with many of these the necessity
of a double standard of morals, but
not being willing to place him in that
class without confirmation of my conclusions, at the close of his lecture I
went up to him and said: &quot;From
things you have said in this lecture
I am forced to certain conclusions and
I wish to put to you a direct question,
'Do you believe in a double standard
of morals?'&quot; His reply was, &quot;Yes, I
do.&quot; I said with indignation: &quot;Then I
have nothing more to say to you,&quot; and
left the room. Other ladies remonstrated with him upon his position and
were confirmed in the opinions they
had formed that he believed in a double standard of morals along sex lines.
Criticized Shaeffer.
You see here, the professor shows
that he believes the girl should be
 judged more strictly than the boy.
This is what is called the double standard of morals. I replied that I did
not believe the girl should be held to
stricter accountability than the boy. I
tried to show him that the laws of nature, those of our civil codes and ethical laws all demand alike chastity on
the part of both man and woman, and
that custom must be made to conform
to these demands.
Having no assurance that I had in
any way succeeded in changing the
professor's views, I deemed it my duty
to inform the president of the university concerning the position of the
professor on the double standard. I
therefore had a long interview with
Dr. Ayres on the matter. I took him
two books on the subject of the necessity of chastity for men, to place in
the university library.
Dr. Ayres said he believed the professor was a moral man, that he would
not do anything to injure the students. To this I replied that I made
no charges against the man's moral
conduct, never having heard of him
until a few days before his lecture,
but that I thought that any teacher of
biology was dangerous for the young
who excused the double standard of
morals because a number of people
condoned sexual immorality in men.
I considered that my responsibility
ended with my report to the president
of the  university.
Added Testimony.
Three years later, and several days after Dr. Stough's criticism against the professor, I was asked by Mrs. Knox if I would add my testimony to hers and others that the professor had said he believed in a double standard of morals. I said that I would and I did so by signing my name to the fol-
 lowing   statement:   &quot;At  the   close   of 
Prof. Schaeffer's lecture I put to him
this direct question, 'Do you believe in
a double standard of morals?' His reply was, 'Yes, I do.'&quot;

<dc:description>I.
WOMAN'S CANDIDATE FOR
EflyMCILMilll FBflM THE CITMlT-UllliE
To The Voters o! Knoxville &gt;~
Because of the failure of the committee of 18 to nominate a woman oh the &quot;People's Ticket,&quot; a num¬ ber of warm advocates of the city manager charter have requested me to ^low them to put forward my name as a candidate for nominatioif for councilman-at-large at the primary election, September 15th, 1923.
My consent- has been given because I believe in a &quot;square deal for all&quot;:—^young and old, rich and poor, white and black and men and women. Those who bear the burdens of family and ¦municipal life should be regarded as egua^ factors in Jioma^njd^ty and no ban should be put on mothers tend business women, be¬ cause of sex.-:- ' ¦   ¦    &lt;&quot;'~~   ~ ,   ¦~-¦—•¦—-••    --
My record as a public spirited citizen is known to all of those who have given attention to the edu¬ cational and welfare activities of Knoxville during the last half century.
In 1885, with my sister, I took charge of the Female Institute which my grandfather, John&quot; Crozier, (first postmaster) helped to found. About that time I bought a home and have been a tax payer ever since. ¦ •    .        _ ' &quot;    .
In that same year I organized the Ossoli Circle, a literary society for women which has the distinction of being the oldest club for women in the south. At the end of five years, being disappointed that I could not prevail upon Ossoli Circle to take up work for civic betterment, 1 organ¬ ized the Woman's Educational and Industrial Union.
Having educated my son and started him in a successful business career, I gave up my school and de¬ voted my whole time to educational and uplift work for city and state. As soon as the trustees voted to ad¬ mit girls to our university, the then
president, Dr,-Gharte8 Babney, wrotfe«^&quot;^'^
to me: &quot;The thing you have so long worked for has come to' pass—the University of Tennessee is no co¬ educational.&quot;
About 1890 I induced the city council to establish the office of po¬ lice matron, Kno!xviIle thus became the first city in the south to put a woman in charge of women offend¬ ers. About this time I began solicit¬ ing the county court to establish an industrial school for girls, and boys. Seven years from that time I was successful and saw the present insti¬ tution established.
I persuaded the King's Daughters to establish the first kindergarten in thii? city. ¦  ¦ .. ,^..;-^„,.,..,... jf--—-&gt; •
The first woman's exchange I also put in operation. A lady is now doing a splendid trade in beaten biscuit who began as a child to make biscuit for that exchange.
All the time I was working to establish these permanent institutions I was helping the police matron in rescue work.   Many girls who had taken the first downward step we returned to respectable society.
It is impossible for me to enumerate here all th^ civic activities that I have helped forward. Some are: The first hosjpital for Knoxville, parks and play grounds, juvenile court and first refuge for unfortu¬ nates.- i    .,::,,.   ..¦¦¦'/¦¦.,: V ',::;¦;¦¦.¦¦¦- ¦;
I was chairman Of the committee that established the Associated Charities, and was one of the found- .eis of the Writers' Club.
In 191Q I organized the first local suffrage association. We had a state suffrage association for many years, of which I was a member from its inception. I have been state president of the suffrage association, also of the Federation of Women's Clubs and the first vice-president of the State Parent-Teachers Asso¬ ciation. . ' .
As soon the legislature gave the women municipal suffrage I organized the Non-Partisan Municipal League. Mrs. T. P. Miller served as chairman during its active existence and proved a. most'efficient one. Because of this league's splendid work, twice as many women were registered to vote in Knoxville in our first election after enfranchisement as registered in any other southern city.
Several years ago I was elected president of the board of directors of the woman's building, suc¬ ceeding several presidents who had made a great business success of this woman's enterprise.
Mrs. Geo. F. Mellen only resigned the presidency after all debts had beei^ paid and the building was self-supporting. This enterprise bears witness that women are successful in business when given the opportunity to exercise their business ability freely. •
I have given this hasty sketch of my civic work in the past so that citizens may draw their own conclusions as to whether I would be an efficient,,ai){l faith|ul servant should voters place me in the position of a councilman from Hhe city-at-lai'ge.
It is possible for me to give my whole time to the duties of a councilman, as I have no family to look after, nor any regular business to claim my attention.
I am for every progressive improvement that will tend to make our city. a desirable place in which to live and a great business center, but I shall watch carefully that the means used to this end are prac¬ tical and not wastefully extravagant.
The public may rest assured that everything that will safeguard the home and give adequate protec- ^ tion to women and children, the weak and unfortunate will receive my hearty support.
One of the most positive traits of mv character is that I will not allow myself to be used by any ring or clique for personal ends. The righteousness of any proposed measure and the benefit that will accrue to the public through its enactment must be shown me. .
Voters of Knoxville, I ask for your support and promise in return efficient and faithful service.
V*-- &lt;^- &lt;;?•

<dc:description>MRS. L. CROZIER-FRENCH MRS. L. CROZIER  FRENCH
ThOM who recaU .tt»«t active Inferest taken by Mrs. L. Crsvier French In the club world of l31rfelncham during her residence In this cKy and who know the fearless policy and the thorough investi¬ gation she makes of all matters to which she calls jiubllc'attentlort, will not be surprised at her latest enterprise, the startinK Of a monthly Journal to be known as  &quot;The People.&quot;
Mrs. French will be editor and manager of her Journal, the first ftumber of which' will   be   itsued  In  Knoxville  this  month.
Mi* French Intends that her Journal shall be an exponent of the people. It is to be a publication that will fearlessly defend the rights and privileges of the people and will vigorously demand the enforcement of the laws that have been enacted for the good government of the people. It will contain news of the month, current events, articles political and literary. Itoms concerning art, sci¬ ence, religion; health, ethics and educa¬ tion.
No one will doubt that this Jouvral will, be conducted on bread and educative lines and that !t will be a. potent factoe In promotins g«ocl government.
Mrs. French's aims will be to arouse the people of her city to certain conditions that now exist and she asks co-opera¬ tion in the effort to rescue municipal and county affairs from the hands of the partisan politicians, be they. Republicans or Democrats. She believes that for a people to allow partisans to manage their |-municipal and county affairs is to sub- mit to be made victims, of the spoils sJ'S- tem. Mrs. French's Journal, in other words la to be devoted to &quot;the idealizing of the real and the realizing of the ideal. &quot; Among th,e pertinent questions asked by Mrs. French, and which may strike a responsive chord in many cities are the following; ,
Why should the Sunday closing law be enforced against stores In general but not against barrooms,?
Why war the office of police matron abolished, after having been In success¬ ful operation for ten years? Abolished, notwltiistandlng the earnest protest ,of KnoxviUe's best citizens.
Why Is It that we have not enough money to make our public' schools what they should be? •      .    .
Why Is It that we have not even one lltUe plat of ^ground for a resting place In  the  heat of summer?
&quot;Iiy io ft that the ordinances In re¬ gard to the keeping of our streets frfn of .flltl] are not In any degree enforoAl? , It Is because the people have not or^' gantzed.
' It Is because the people have not sali to the ofriclals, &quot;You must do your duty!&quot;'; It Is because the people have not said to the ring leaders. &quot;Thus tar shalt thoU go and no farther.&quot;

Dr. White ^ve'the credit for starting Atlant.-i's eTolutlon when, twenty-fire years sg.), he sought to instill morality and ChrU- tianlty inlo the fibre of Atkuta and the 1Ms&gt;pie   of  AtlaHla.
For several minutes Dr. White dis¬ cussed Atlanta's successful campaign for the abolition of the vice district, paying a tribute to Chief Beavers, of the Atlsnta police department, and holding hlni up as a hero of 'Georgia. &quot;Atlanta is today eontroUed by Christian men, placed In authority hy the Christian forces  of Atlanta.&quot; he  declared.
He said that there are not one hun¬ dred decent citizens of Atlanta who now prefer the segregated district over the present freedom from organized vice. 'Of those who claim to prefer the old order, said Dr. Wliite. you will find that they are dominated by some financial or other conuection with the business. He told of Atlanta's campaign meth¬ ods In dealing with the moveinent, and of the success the Christian people of i Atlfinta have met with iu dealing with othei evils, since the accomplishment of their  anti-vlce  victory.
Ddminant Liquor Power.
The speaker declared that behind the socia! vice and all other vice, }s the liquor power. When you strike the liquor interests, said Dr. White, you strike a power with a hand at Wash¬ ington and at every state capital in the land. It is a power, he said, that fights for the millions in wealth it returps to thos'e Interested in it. With this power, he said.' the Christian people of Atlanta are now  dealing.
In dealing with the local situation, he declared that a single church, with a united front, has power enough to set a city on fire^
&quot;The situation in Knojctille,&quot; he said, &quot;Is one in which there ought to be no doub*- how every Christian stands.&quot; Tho question involved is larger than the vice question You will have to shift your einpliasis on the vice question, and make the paramount question onetif law en- forcpiuent and civilisation. Your com- inissloner.s have vacated the law and have declined to fulfill their oaths of ofTlce. I have never heard of an in¬ stance like this. I have known lawless and sinful cities, where the law was ig¬ nored and lawlessness reigned, but never before have sworn&quot; officers of 'the law published to: the world that they hope the law against prostitiition will be vio¬ lated as much as possible in resident sectionB of the city. The police order they issued Invites nrustitutloa, and prostitutes to come to Knoxville. The police aife restrained from arresting any prostltufe unless ghe,shoots a firecracker or commits some 'indenendent' offense.&quot;
Dr. White declared he believed that the majority of the Knoxville police force feel and that they are conscious of the fact that they are being made to violate their oath, of office,  and would
Jireler to do their duty. On this sub- ecT, he said that there isn't a com-. mtinity in the south that wouldn't rally and stand behind a police officer that dii his duty regardless, of orders received from those in authorilT.
In his ck&gt;Ring reKarlks. Dr. . White discussed the question of segregation. He said that the question hag been thor- oughlj Studied bv sociologists, scientists and government experts, and all hare readied the common verdict that thf segregated district must go. and is not needed. He pointed to Chicago, Min¬ neapolis and other large cities- whose people have driven the segregated dls- trirts  from' their- borders.
IFollowing   Dr.   White.   Mrs.   French 1 presented the    resolution.    iShe bespoke i the co-operation of every Christian worn-1 ao iu Knoxville in the campaign for the riddance   of   social   vice  from   the   city. The   resolutions   she   presented,   and which were unanimously adopted by ris¬ ing vote,  are  a.s  follows:—
The Besolutions.
Whereas, the otwition taken by the city commissioners of Knoxville at the insMgation of Mayor .Hels¬ kell, through his special message In regard to the nuisance law, is au in- 8uU to the womanhood of our city, and.
&quot;Whereas, the dtv commissioners hav« ignored the repeated appeals our women that they enforce the law. and,
&quot;Whereas,  the  women of Knoz- ' rllle have no method of redress ex¬ cept through  the manhood  of our city.
&quot;Therefore, be it resolved by the msss meeting of women that the voters of Knoxville are hereby 'or- gently requester) to assert their con¬ victions r,i right, and itemand the enfOTcen-.ent of the law, or take such legal steps as may be neces¬ sary to .tecure this end.
&quot;Second,   that   we  deeply   regret that the stale of affairs In our city should   necessitate   this   action   op the part of women.&quot; Following the adoption of t]ie tc' tlonii.  cards with    pledges    PraMi &quot; '  ,     '&quot; ,&quot;     '    ¦¦—&quot;ii*&quot;&quot;***.

MRS. L CROZIER FRENCH WOMAN'S CANDIDATE
FOR
COUNCILMAN FROM CITY-AT-LARGE
To Hie Voters of KnoxviUe:—
Because of the failure of the committee of 18 to nominate a . woman on the &quot;People's Ticket,&quot; a number of warm advocates of the city manager charter have re¬ quested me to allow them to put forward my name as a candidate for nomination for councilman-at-large at the primary election, September 15th, 1923.       ^
My consent has been givert because I believe in &quot;a square deal for all&quot;—young and old, rich and poor, white and black and men and women. Those who bear the burdens of family and municipal life should be regarded as equTlTactors in home and city and no ban should be put on mothers and business women, because of sex.
My record as a public spirited citizen is known to all of those who have given at¬ tention to the educational and welfare activities of Knoxville during the last half century.
In 1885, with my sister, I took charge of the Female Institute which my grand¬ father, John Crozier, (first postmaster) helped to found. About that time 1 bought a home and have been a tax payer ever since.
In that same year I organized the Ossoli Circle, a literary society for w;ppieii which has the distinctiop of being the oldest club for women in the sojjth. At the end of five years, being disappointed that I could not prevail upon Ossoli Circle to take up work for civic betterment, 1 organized the Woman's Educational and Industrial' Union.
Having educated my son and started* him in a successful business career. I gave up my school and devoted my \«*ole time to educational and uplift work for city and state. As soon as the trustees voted to admit giils to our university^ the then president, Dr. Charles Dabney wrote to me: &quot;The thing you have so long worked for has come to pass—-the University of Tennessee is now co-educational.&quot;
About 1890 I induced the city council to establish the office of police matron, Knoxville thus became the first city in the south to put a woman in charge of wopien offenders. About this time 1 began soliciting the county court to establish an industrial school for girls and boys. Seven years from that tirne 1 was successful and saw the pres¬ ent institution established.
I persuaded the King's Daughters to establish the first kindergarten in this city.
The first woman's exchange 1 also put in operation. A lady is now doing a splen¬ did trade in beaten biscuit who began as a child to make biscuit for that exchange.
All the time 1 was working to establish these permanent institutions I was help¬ ing the police matron in rescue work. Many girls^who had taken the first downward step we returned to respectable society.
It is impossible for me to enumerate here all the civic activities that 1 have helped forward. Some are: the first hospital for Knoxville, parks and play grounds, juvenile court and first refuge for unfortunates.
I was chairman of the committee that established the Associated Charities, and was 'one of the founders of the Writers'Club.&quot;
In 1910 1 organized the first local suffrage association. We had a state suffrage association for many years, of which 1 was a member from its inception. 1 have been state prcjsident nf the suffrage association, also ogthfiFederation of Women's Oubs and

TENNESSEE HGHT
UNSETTLED BY
COMMIHEE
Although the spedal committee appoint¬ ed by Dr. Shaw to consider the merlta of the claims of the delegate from Tennes¬ see appointed to the national convention by Mrs. Crosier-French and those ap¬ pointed by Mrs. James McCormick was In secret session at the Hotel Hermitage at an early hour this morning they had beat Dnable to reach a decision- as to which faction was entitled to seats on tbe floor of the convention.
The Cro«ler-French delegates were seat¬ ed Thursday In the preliminsry report of the credentials committee brought In by Mrs. Stanley McCormick, chairman of tne committee, but objection was Immediately offered to the report by Miss Brwln of Chattanooga. Miss Jrwln Is one Of tbe delegates appointed by Mrs, James Mc-l Cormlck. MUb Kate Oordon of Lonlslaniil demanded that the respective claims of the -two contesting delegations be referred to a special committee. This committee was' appointed by Dr. Shaw and they took up tbe investigation Immediately after tbe night session at the Ryman auditorium.
The contest between the two opposing tactions In the Tennessee association dates back to tbe resignation of Miss Elliott as president of the state organisation ana the subsequent election of Mrs. Crosier- French, which the faction headed by Mrs James McCormick has claimed was entirely Irregular.    The first  break  in  the  ranks
(rff  the  Tennessee  association took  _ In the spring Of this year, but reached »
actual  split at  the Kno»vlHe &quot;-
when   tbe   two   (actioas  held
In the hall Independent of, each 	
selected the two sets of delegates to the national convention. i
So complicated Is the history «t the rap¬ ture In tbe state association that it was the opinion of many prominent national sor- fragists in close touch with the phases ot ihe case Thursday night that the special committee appointed by Dr. Shaw would- be unable to decide which of the two op-, posing factions 'was entitled to seats m the conventions and would in all probabil¬ ity refSr the matter back to the conven¬ tion.
It was learned froM an aothorlMti've source that the personnel of the coqimittee would not permit of the possibility of ¦ compromise being reached, thereby agree¬ ing to seat certain delegates from each faction  in  an  effort  to  restore harmony.
The delegates appointed by Mrs. Crosier. French who were declared accredited dflj; gates to the convention in the credentlaUr committee's report brought In by Mrs. Stanley  McCormick, are as follows:
Mrs. Isaac Reece of Memphis, Mrs. John M Kenny, Mrs. Guilford Dudley. Mrs. Joseph J. Boach, Mrs. Reau Folk and Miss Emma Spencer, all of Nashville; Mrs. Fred

Suffragist Leader Charges Instructor Schaeffer With Having Said Woman is More to Blame in Delinquencies Than the Man—Answers Resolution Published by Daily Papers That Reflected on Veracity of Ladies Who Heard Educator Lec¬ ture in 1913.
Editor of The Voice of Labor:
When Dr. Stough was in Knoxville hfc heard through a second party a remark made by a lady that a certain professor of the University of Ten¬ nessee had said that he, the professor, believed in a double standard of mor¬ als. Whereupon Dr. Stough made an attack upon the iiniversity. The ex¬ ecutive committee demanded his au¬ thority. The lady whose remarlc was the canse of the attack telephoned me and asked me if I would stand by her in her statement. I replied that I would ind I did, so did three other ladies. ^
When the trustees met a resolution exonerating the professor and reflect¬ ing upon the ladies' veracity was pass¬ ed and published in the daily papers.
Though the daily papers published the resolution condemning the ladies, the Journal and Tribune and the Sen¬ tinel refused to piiblish my statement of the whole case.
Enclosed please find the following papers which I submit to you for your consideration.
By Mrs, L. Crozier-French, letter to the executive committee, a protest to the special committee, letter to trus¬ tees, letter from M, E. church, South, statement by Prof. Schae:er before trustees and letters from Dr. Ayres.
Respectfully submitted.

Tenn, Honorable Sirs:—At the last meet-
{ing of the board of trustees of the University of Tennessee a resolution was passed -which reflects upon the veracity and integrity of the conduct ''of several ladies of knoxville, myself amtyig the number. I copy the reso¬ lution from the Journal and Tribune of a July, 1916, issue, as follows:
''Having examined the newspaper report of the tecture of Prof. Schaef¬ fer in the Knoxville Journal and Tri¬ bune of June 20, 1913, prepared by
these respectable women. We furnish¬ ed absolutely no evidence upon which Dr. Stough could be justified in mak¬ ing charges &quot;so enormous that no man of clean Ufe could be guHty of them.&quot; Just here I wish to emphasize the fact that no one could possibly disap¬ prove more of the public attack of Dr, Stough against the professor and the university than I do. Hence it seems most unjust that I should be put con¬ spicuously forward as either his aider, abettor or informer. Yet my alleged action is made the basis upon which
Dune 01 ou«« ^v, *^;&quot;' ^-'XrVVnt^ri  your decisioH is given which exonor MPS. U C. French, we feel warranted  ^ „rofes8or and reflects unb.
ih relying upon the lattet &quot;Written when the lecture was fresh in mind, rather than upon the former state¬ ments prepared three years later. We do not in the leaat suggest that the ladies' statements are not the result of an absolute desire to be fair to Prof. Schaeffer, but merely the report of Mrs. French being commendatory in tone, is incompatible with the be¬ lief that the statements now alleged were in fact in her mind when the article for the paper was written. When to this was added the denial of Prof. Schaeffer that he ever held or expressed such an opinion and the de¬ nial of Prof. J.   &lt;;.    Pridmore, Miss
ates the professor and reflects upbH the veracity, intelligence and discres- sion of myself and others.
Denial &lt;rf &quot;Coinpliment&quot;
Your resoliition states that MrSi L. Crozier-French wrote a cmnplimentary article of a lecture of the professor delivered on June 19,1913, and in 1916 she made contrary stetements. The .evidence upon which you mako this charge against me was furnished you by said Professor. I' pronounce this evidence false. I wrote ho article com¬ plimentary of the lecture and I did verbally condemn in no uncertain terms that part of the lecture treat- :ing of prostitution. I took issue with the professor himself during the de¬ livery of the lecture in order to give him a hint that he was touching on dangerous ground. For he was ad¬ dressing an anti-vice league composed bf women organized for the purpose of helping the churches to do away with the segregated district and to furnish homes for the inmates of houses to be closed. He said during his lecture it was useless to work for he breaking up of prostitution, that s far back as any record of peoples xisted this institution had been main- ined in a}! countries of the world d that it always would continue. [That the prostitute was such because of her heredity and that she could not escape from that destiny. I interrupt- ied me professor here to ask if he did not think many young girls through ignorance or innocence or be¬ cause of 'violence were reduced to so low a social position that they could not rise, and in consequence were forced to join tbe professional class of unfortunates? He said no doubt th«re were some such, but very few.
Douhle Standard.
I had been so accustomed during thirty years of public work to hear men claim that man's necessities caus¬ ed this condition of a permanent class of women to be sacrificed, that I could not help but suspect that the professor held with many of these the necessity of a double standard of morals, but not being willing to place him in that class without confirmation of my con¬ clusions, at the close of his lecture I went up to him and said: &quot;From things you have said in this lecture I am forced to'certain conclusions and I wish to put to you a direct question, 'Do you believe in a double standard of morals?'&quot; His reply was, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; I said with indignation: &quot;Then I have nothing more to say to you,&quot; and left the room. Other ladies remonstra¬ ted with him u^on his position and were confirmed, in the opinions they had formed that he believed in a dou¬ ble standard of morals along sex lines,
Criticized ShaeiFer.
You see here, the professor shqWa that he believes the girl   shouIdT be
[judged more strictly than    the   boy.
iThis is what is called the double stan¬ dard of morals. I replied that I did not believe the girl should be held to stricter accountabiUty than the boy. I tried to show him that the laws of na¬ ture, those of our civil codes and eth-
,ical laws all demand alike chastity on
'the part of both man and woman, and that custom must be made to conform to these demands. Having no assurance that T had in
jimy way succeeded in changing the professor's views, I deen»^d&quot;it my duty
I to inform the president of the univer¬ sity concerning the position of the professor on Sie double standard. I therefore had a long interview with Dr. Ayiws on the matter. I took hiin two books on the subject of the neces¬ sity of chastity for men, to plaice in the university library.
Dr. Ayres said he believed the pro¬ fessor was a moral man, that he would

Your honorable committee will note ^no charges against the man's moral
that the basis upon which Prof. Schaeffer is acquitted and the five la¬ dies accused of propogating an enor¬ mous charge against an innocent nian is the statement that Mrs. French wrote a complimentery article about Prof. Schaefter's lecture in the Jour¬ nal and Tribune. I pronounce this statement utterly false. I have never written at any time any complimen¬ tary article of Prof. Schae:er or his WCture. When I saw this statement in the paper I telephoned to Dr. Ayrss
Ruby Franklin and Mrs. J. C. Prid-! to_know upon what authority the com- more, who were present at the lee- j mittee made the assertion fiiat I had ture, that any such    statement    was   vvritten a complimentary    article    of

That Rev. Henry W. Stough, the'evan¬ gelist, who conducted a campaign In this city, was in no way warranted in tha statement be made concerning Prof. A. A. Schaeffer, of the University of Ten¬ nessee, and that the evangelist should have withdrawn these statecients as soon as he saw the letters that were fnrritohed by him to the trustees of the unlvor- sity, was the sense of the special coin- mlttee of the university trustees which took this matter nnder advisement at the meeting of the board of trustees held on Tuesday, at the university.

Added Testimony.
Three years later, and several days after Dr. Stough's criticism against the professor, I was asked by Mrs. Knox if I wouia add my testimony to hers and others that the professor had said he believed in a double standard of morals. I said that I would and I did so by signing my name to the fol¬ lowing statement: &quot;At the close of Prof. Sohaeffer's lecture I put to him this direct question, 'Do you believe in a double standard of morals?'

Mrs. L. Crozier French Will Ad¬ dress lyiorristown Club feb. 22 On Important Subject
¦&quot;Activities ot Women In tho Prob- If-ms of a City Government,&quot; 'will be Ihe subject of an address to be de¬ livered by Mrs. I&gt;. Crozier PreU'ch, pres¬ ident of Ossoli circle at the citizenship ilay proerara of .Somo Sala circle, Feb- •I'liaryZZ, at Morrlstown. This 'wlU be ihe leading address of the day; other live minute talks being given by differ¬ ent members a.s follows:
&quot;Types of City Government.&quot;
&quot;Mayor and Council Type&quot;—Mrs, Harris.
&quot;Commls.&gt;ilon F-orb&quot;—Mrs. Witt.
&quot;City Manager Plan&quot;—Mrs. Phillips.
The thenin for the subjeots under discussion is suggested by the quo¬ tation from Lowell which heads the program;
&quot;Xew occasions teaoh new duties; 'lime  makes ancient good uncouth.&quot;
TI\e Morrlstown elulv Is greatly In- I'ertsted In a practical sqlution of some ut the problems which face every com¬ munity, and ho\)os to follow up the discussions by Rome action that shall result Iti' permanent good to all con¬ cerned. It Is pBrticuisrly fortunate in securing as a .speaker Jilrs. L. Croiler French who is ono of KnoxviUe's nrost Hctlve and brilliant olub 'women, and- who has been for some time at the head of Ossoli circle.
Aq Open Letter To The Knox &lt;; Oountj Election Commission,
. Gentlemen:
It has been announced that your commission has Instructed rcBtstiars to compel women to give their exact ase when applying for a registra¬ tion cortlficato. -
It is the purpose of this com- itunioatlon to ask you to give your reason to thu public for slvlng; such instiuellon.
if id' aioat probable that many are as mpch puzzled as I am, as to the necessity or advisability of such an Interpretation of the election law. I hope that it Is not due'to mental weakness that I cannot think of one Biiigle reason why registrars should know the (;xact age ot any one who applies for a certificate to vote. Tho feeistrar must have reason to be¬ lieve tha^ the applicant has arrived at the leaal age, twenty-one, which is rcfiulrtil by our state law of ev¬ ery voter. Why should the registrar know anything more as regard^ the ago  of aiiplicautsT
tine of the commission la reported us saying, &quot;The women now, liayo STOt into politics and they must be. rerohcilcd to complying with all re- 1 qiiirements.&quot; If the rcQuirement is ohe which in no way promotes the Interest of the public but is most displeasing' to mafiy oloctors, why should they obey It? I have not the &lt;'l«&gt;cliort law to Vhlch tO refer, but 1 venture to say ii Is not the in¬ tent of that law to nry into the private per.sonal affairs of electors. Kverv elector should resist, by en¬ deavoring to have changed, any law which approaches tyranny . even though It Involves so small a mat¬ ter aa the exact  age of the voter.
Toll are not compelled to put a tyrannical construction on this law, why do 'SO?

PETITION HOOPER TO —^ ^    NAME WOMAN JUDGE
jlre. I,. Crozier French, well known Mmohg' Memphis club women, &quot;social workcrs»and ei|ual suffrage advocates has become a &lt;-'.indidate for judge of tho 5uv.enilo court at Knoxville. She Is the first woman in the state to public¬ ly aspire to such an office.
A number of Memphis women have written letters supporting her Candida cy. Mr». French has many closa friends here. She Was a prominent figure In th« convention of the Ten- i nessee Mothers' congress In Memphis last year, and this year the congress has Indorsed a bill enabling women tp become members ot school boards and juvenile court Judges.
&quot;No policemen nor lawyers are al¬ lowed In a Juvenile court Of the right' character.&quot; declares a pttltlon to Gov. Hooper which has found many Mem¬ phis signers, and seeking the appoint¬ ment of Mrs. French to the place. &quot;Visitors should be ad'^lttc'' only by tickets issued by tho judge. The whole idea Is to remove the children as far as possible from the suspicion of crlmo, and to keep as secret as pos¬ sible the delinciuonrles of children, to the- end that reformation may be ac¬ complished without the hardening processes that might ordinarily follow the ordinary trials In other courts.
&quot;It was happened that this idea haa
not obtained with some of the    men
I who have liceh placed at the head ol
: Juvenile courts in several ot our cities
i and that In .^onsoquenc« no great Inni,-
' jirovenicnt has b»s*n made In regard to
i tho condition o« children over the oW
I mode of trial.    No one who has    not
1 served an apprenticeship to uncial ser-
\'tco Is tltted for tbe place of juvenile
imlae.&quot;—..Jlejtnphla N^s tfclniltar.
Mrs. I,. Crozier French was unanlnro'jsly endorsed as an inde¬ pendent candidate for councilman from the city at large by a group ^f representative women assembled t the Lyceum building yesterday fternoon.
Mrs. French's nomination came t tha, end of a rat^her lengthy dis- tusalon ot the action'of the Comrait- ee of 78 in falling to name a woman n the People's ticket, Mrs. George '. Mellen and Mrs. C. A, Weaver lacing her name before the  meet-
in calling the meeting to order Ira Frencli had stated that it was ot the purpose either to nominate r endorse a candidate at this time, . sitnpiy to discuss the situation onfrontlna: women from its various niries. She said she te\f. the citl- pns' committee had made a mistake I assuming to name a ticket^—a Ight that was delegated alone to he primary, and that she did not nderatand how 18 people out of 1)0,000 could nominate  16 people on
ticket and that nobody else should an. She then asked for nominations &gt;r chairman and Mrs. Stuart Tows as chosen. Mrs. 8. M. Miller was ected secretary.
Discussion of the matter at issue as entered upon iirunedtately, .¦ery woman expressing herself as favor of a woman on the council, id the organisation of the women the ciiy to stand behind such a
ndidatr.
&quot;We   must   not   He  down   on   this
oposition simply because the men not    nominate    us.&quot;    said    Mrs.
eaver. &quot;and I think It Is not only
¦t but rlaht that a woman should
ter the race.&quot;
Miss Kate White    said    that she

ndidacv of a women earlier In the

Present indications are that S|ena- tot 8hi«Ida &quot;WiU be ajipointed to the •ttMHeme coart bench in which event, |^,««!j«« oX UnftedL Statia S«iutor (iDuld be vacant, and the vacancy irc«ld have to b« filled by the gov- «rapr. A movement was started yes¬ terday in Knoxville to have Gov. Taylor appoint Mrs. L. Grozito French to succeed Sen. Shields. i Mrs French has contrlbatcd sever- id ar'JcIes to the HERALD on pol¬ itical and educational matters, which makes this appointment ot IckhI In¬ terest. She has been prominent in many reforms in stato laws, and is held m h*gh esteem by Knoxville peo¬ ple, vh?fe she has 9,?ent many yoars of her life. Should Mrs. French be Appointed, she would be the first we&gt; man io over serve in the United States Senate. Mrs. Felton who* was recently appointed in Georgia to iill out the unexpired term of Sen. Tom Wfttava will likely never take her seat in the senate, but will simply be given the title of seJiator with the salary for the few months of the «n&lt; expired term.
1 *^   &quot;&quot;StatMT and sShenT Heard
il     Before IntroduclflR Dr.  R. F. Op 11 enhlmei-, al.so a member of the  pres¬ ent board,  Mrs.  French   referred to the fact that Mrs. Belle Karna Mor¬ ris   was     &quot;unfortunately&quot;     On     the ' i-'pople's ticket but that friends and I sttjJportera ot Mrs. French and Mrs. 1 Miller were anxious that she should I ba'   elected  iis  a  member    of    the Between  three  and  four  hundred! men and women, among them sev-j eral  of the Itidopendent oandldate.&lt;!! for council and school board, greeted Mrs. Fi-ench and 1 stened to an ad¬ dress into wiiich she Injected a great deal ot humor, and sarcasm d!recte&lt;l at the PenpJe'^R ticket and tho com- -fliittee of 18.   Mrs. French made herl , talk lagiilfe.^ answer to an editorial j reaarOIBx Tier tisndidacy    appearint i iJMonday In The Knoxville News, but digressed at intervals to discuss the failure  of the  rommittee  of, 18 in i place her on the People's ticket, and the action of tlv&gt; T.ieague of Women Voters   in   withdra-^ing  its  support from her.   ^h« declared that only a small  part of. the    Knox    County Jjeague of Women Vol«-» 'was lend- '.ng support  to  tlie People's  tk;ket, and   that   later on   the  organization would establish Itself as the balance of power In thlhga political. B«pudlation Personal Mrs; French denied that she  had ever said the People's ticket  should be' repudiated because It dW not con¬ tain a woman, but that she herseli had  regulated  It.
&quot;I also repudiate tho committee of !    I   do   not   consider  *.hat

tnat anything should be done that would hinder other groups who are dotiuc what they thought was for the hest interests of the city. &quot;We want women with brains—not women with social notoriety or those virho want to see their names in the news¬ paper,&quot; said Miss White.
Mlsa White later replied to Mrs. H. C. MilnOr who niade the state¬ ment that she was not interested in the people's ticket either for or usainst It, by saving that she (Miss Whitel was very much Interested in the success ot Mr. Brakebiii. the people's candidate In her district and that she was working dally for his election.
At this Juncture Mrs, French arose ,ina said that she wished to present (crtaln  matters to the meeting.
&quot;I am going to tell the truth Just as thought I were sworn.&quot; said &gt;Irs. French. ' &quot;I never tell anything b'.it tha truth and this makes people say that Mrs. Frianch slaps folks in the faoe. As soon as the new charter was t&gt;aBsed a certain woman came to me&quot; and said, 'I hear we are to have a woman on our ticket, and I want to say that 1 want you to let me put yoiir name forward as a candidate. I regard you as the logical candidate for that place, and I believe it Is I'llpable to everj'body that your life wcrk has been of a public charac- ttr. I believe you should represent us on the ticket and want you to let us put your name before tiie peo¬ ple.'
&quot;Then the Constitutional League in a moment of enthusiasm advo¬ cated my candidacy, and so my hat was In the ring. &quot;Then I understood that I was not to do any more. The I^eague of Women Votera was to do the rest—somebody else was the rest—and I was most unhappy tnct cn«&quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot;i'' w» .Tww - jyjMPfW ,** Woman a

Sl» denied that she set th» WO- muh's movement above good aov- crnment. but said that. she had worked for the enfranchisement of women that goo.l government mlah* colne about. She said that she had not sought to hold office, and that she had never worked to put a WO-^ man iu DUblic office in her life.        ^
Mrs. French referred to the fa&lt;&lt;t tl»t she was being accused of vtiintc to the camp of the politiciana &quot;Thei- tell mo they are 'mllcif nolltldana.&quot; said Mrs. French, &quot;but I do not core.

Would Keep Men  Btraight
The speaker said tlmt many people did not like hef because she snoke her mind too plainly, and she aave due notice that If she worn elecfed to speak her nUnd would keep the 10 B peak her in Ind would keep the men straight.&quot; Terhau.s 1 am bold about speaking the truth.' 'said Mrs. French, &quot;but its rather a relief some¬ times amonir so many liars to see the naked truth walkinsr about.
She concluded her talk with tn :-p- peal for support, tj such a degree that the primary would settle the matter and she would not have to continue her campaign for election on September 2.
.Mrs. 8. L Bxanch. eampaien man- uRer for Mrs. French Introduced Mrs. Thomi'.a Poaeock Miller, can¬ didate for member of the sohool boai-d. Mrs. Miller sUted her claims for election, the chief one be- in-.- her record aa a member of tl»e present board. She said she consid- eiod herself the school patrons can¬ didate, and that she would continue her iMwt efforts to servo them ir tleoted. ,</dc:description>

TO MRS. L.C, FRENCH,
I President Ossoli Circle—
i        DEAR MRS. FRENCH:    Your calling of a mass meeting ' for Sunday afternoon to hear a lecture on &quot;Selected Motion Pictures&quot; and to have an open forum on that subject, is a j splendid act of good citizenship.

I       Censorship is not the remedy.   Tlie motion picture, like the! sorshlp.,
drama, the play, and the newspaper, is an interpretation of fP'^'t^''^^ ^&quot;&quot;o™ the point of view of
life, and a criticism of government and institutions.   As such a_i *^^ mother.   She is a mother her-

IMrs.   L.   Crojsier   I'-rftnch, Knoxville,   Tena. Dear Sirs. French:   I beg to ackti ecelpt   of   the   copy   of    the    n (lassed at a meeting of a Knox con mittee&quot; of the Tennessee brniH'h cf lonal   Women's   party,   oil   Manli which   please   accept   my   than*!&quot;. ,   I   trust  that  those   who  control feanisjitlon   of   the   bouse 'will gl^i ppportunlty  to &quot;iote on  the auii'Twl (the constitution.    I  am  transmjul,. letter to Mr. KItehIn,  leader &lt;&gt;t the mu.iiu- ity, with the shggfstlon that the committed [having this legislation in chnrBi- report Out ithe amendment for the consiiltraloD of the jhouse, ete.
With great respect,  I  am &quot; Sincerely,
&quot;r.   W.   AUSTIN.
The position of the married wo- en, according to the laws of Tennessee, is nothing more or less than that of a slave. It may be very provoking to many of the residents of the state to have such a statement made, but the,- [reiteration of disagreeable truths is a necessity if reforms are to be [carried forward.
ll   In   1909   being   chairman   ot  one Ipf  the study &quot;sections of  Ossoli,  I Ijrought to the notice of the mem¬ bers,  the  legal  status  of  the  wo- knen of  T-ennessee.      The    women were amazed  to find that a mar- fled woman in this commonwealth poses control  of .lU    her property, ¦eal and personal and cannot make will  except under great restrlc- ions.       That   she     has    no   legal Ight  to  the   control   of  her  chil- Iren.    and    that    though the law Ives   her   husband  control  of   all ihe   possesses,   there     is   no   ade- ;Uate   punishment   for   him   if  he ill's  to use  this  property  for the lupport   of  wife  and  family.      If :hi8   Is   not     the     condition -of  a ilave  then I do  not know what a ijjve's condition Is. l^omen having been kept in Ig- lOrance of their true position  be- 'ore the . law,    this    condition  of things was a surprise to most of tlife members of OssoM-    A motion was passefl. unanimously  that  the phalrman  of  law  and  constitution bt the    State     Federation   should ipring, the legal status  ot the  wo-  . [ineai of Tennessee to the notice of Ihe  1'&gt;deration    &quot;Of  clubs,   with   a .' riew  of seeing If something could hot he done to improve the mar- Hed' wornan's   position&quot; before  the law.
This was done at the convention hIch met in Nashville In May, jffao. A resolution was passed that , Uie pre.sident appoint a commlt- m(^ tu compile the laws concerning fie women of Tennessee ana that report be made to the next con- jentlon; The president, Mrs. Mc- (ormlck. appointed Mrs. French, ihalrman, and left to her the se- ei'tion of the other members ot I ho committee. She wrote to each president of the federated^ clubs of the state, asklnR that she. appoint a member of this committee froin ' her (dub, In this way interest was aroused in the dub.-^ all over the state and the women began to study diligently their poslti^ft before the, law. IMany of them were told by the men of their family and even by lawyers, of some reputation in the state, that it wtis al' a mistake, about the laws of Tennessee not l&gt;elng ad- vanlBgeouB to women, and one of the examples the.v gave in evi¬ dence, wras that a married woman (lid not have to keep a contract. These repvesentatlvt'S ot women have not the moral sen.se sutncient- . cultivaifc^.tc;!. rp.tognlsse the fact hot   such 'a   Uiw  is  ,i degradation
to&quot; the women instead ot a protec-     \ tion.    Sucli a law can  be nothing but degrade as it reflects not oflly upon   the   Intelligence    of  women, but upon her moral sense as well. We are told that the early fath¬ ers   ot  the   church     at    a  council onco   debated    the  question  as  to whetlier a  woman had a soul.    It .seems  the  lawmakers   of  Tennes-   ' see decided this point in the nega¬ tive.    This  matter     of    the   legal status of the women of Tennessee was reported upon by Mrs. French at  the convention  in  Chattanooga in  1910, and at  the convention  at Memphis by Mrs. Turney, of Nash¬ ville, In 1911, and by the president of   the   Federation  In  Sewanee  in 1912   when   .she  made   it  the  sub¬ ject   of  her annual  address.      No one    subjo&lt;;t    has    received   more attention  from   the  State   Federa¬ tion.'than   this.       The  matter has been  brought  twice  to  the atten¬ tion of the Tennessee Bar associa¬ tion, and both times a motion was passed  that    changes    should    be made  in our    laws    'reinovlng the disabilities ot married women. One or more bills have been Introduc¬ ed  into  the present legislature  In compllanqe    with   this    semiment and   it   is 'hoped     there     will     bo enough statesmenship in that body to   perceive   the   right   thing   and to do it. .
Reports from the' capital say that the judiciary committee after a heated discussion, have decided to report favorably on.' the removal of  married  women's disabilities.
Some of the friends of equal suftrage say it is not good policy to 'work for. a change in our an- .tiquated laws, as tliey are su'ch' good evidence . ot the futility -ot ha'V'ing women represented by men; with tho hope of .getting full ,1us- licc for the women. Bad men do not care for lustice ahd good ones, are too much engaged with tryln|f to get justice for themselves and families to spend time looking af¬ ter the rights of women in general. Good men take care' of their own ,families and naturally tlnd this -occupies most of their time and intelligence. Who can blatne them, if they forget the-fact that they are the political representa¬ tives of all women who are dis¬ franchised '.'
Republican governments were established because _ wise men found out all (jiasses must tie put in a position to defend their own rights otherwise pross in.iustice would be done to man&gt;'. Women have been ao long considered on¬ ly, aa appendages to men, that many, not very intelligent people, find it difficult to readjust their thought and give women place as individual units.
The question wo now await with interest is, will - our Tennessee representatives now in session, be equal   to  the hccasionj^

Such has been the query of many In¬ different and the vitally opposed to women's right to exercise the ballot.
But thlsre Is no doubt In the minds ot some women as to what they are going to with It. Such were women attending the- &quot;Victory Banquer' given Tuesdny evening at the Wo¬ man's building in special compliment to the members of the legislature from Kast Tennessee, who cast their votes for ratification at the recent special session bt the legislature. I &quot;The New Citizenship&quot; was the i keynote of the talks of the evening, ! and each -peaker referi-ed. to the new freedom and emancipation of women with Its consequent responsibilities, privileges and opportunities.
Mrs.' l/. ,C. Fienoh, who was Iden¬ tified with the suffrage struggle since Its' inception in Tennessee, presided as the toastmistress of the even¬ ing. ¦ Mrs. French ' was ' attired in black lace, and with this costume wore a banner of yellow, purple ahd v/hlte, the colors ot the National Woman's Party. She had worn this banner on Ihe occasion ot her Inter¬ view with Gov. Cox and &quot;Senator Harding as a member of the commit¬ tee of women selected by Miss Alice Paul, national .chairman ot the wo¬ man's  party,   ¦
Senator   Houk   Speaks   First
Shortly after the guests had Been seated at the tables,' and while the first course Was being served, Mrs. L. C. French, the toastmistress, an¬ nounced that Senator John C, Houk one of the guests of honor, must leave the meeting early In the evening, and therefore he would speak at tnis time. Senator Houk, who was Slig-ht- ly Indisposed,,spoke briefly.' —-^ have been In the midst ot the battle for the past ten years,&quot; he salii In referring to his efforts on be¬ half Ot the cause of- women's suf¬ frage. &quot;The proudest moments of my lite came when I wrote the suf¬ frage plank in 'he progressive pjat- form of 1912. I was laughed at then. But this plank passed the republican convention In 1916, four years before It was Included In the democm i:;: platform In 1920. I have stood for suffrage tor ten years and I still ij stand for It. irbelleve that If'I had tnOt stood as firmly and as loyally aa I did stand, that It Wpu^ not have passed.

Mrs. French was the second speak¬ er ,, &quot;Pioneers&quot; was the general theme of her talk In which she ga'Ve unstinted praise to the work ot Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw Frances E, Wfllard, Mrs. Fllzabeth £,yle Saxon, of Memphis, and Mrs. .Llde Meriwether, of Memphis. Mrs. French was generous In her praise ot the work ot the W. C, T. U. leaders, whom she said had been most Valuable exponents of . suffrage as thgy realized that they could attain many of their desires through the ballot. In speaking of Dr. Mary Shaw, she remarked that she was the greatest woman speaker she had ev- ' er heard, and had almost uncanny (powers ot presiding over a mass {meeting, despite the tact that Mrs. Shaw was no parliamentarian. &quot;I never knew her to make a mistake. I hear&gt;d her and Mrs. Emmallne Paukhurst on the same progrram one evening, and both were mild, sweet, charming, not hasty, and haa me power of converting all who heard them,&quot;  said she.
Mrs. French eoncluded her talk with references to antl-autfrage lit¬ erature that had been sent her, whlct she said she would distribute If there \',as a .request for It.
On a large purple and white banner Ijabove Mrs. French was this legend: ^¦The Immortals J5xB0—1,&quot; Ex¬ plained by Mrs. French this means the twenty-five senators, the fifty representatlvee In the lower house, minus   Seth   Walker,

Harry T. Burn's Address.
Representative; Harry T. Burn ot McMlnn tounty, who changed his vote In the final roll call, was b^far the moat popular gentlernan sp^ker of the evening.
In presenting Mr. Burn, Mrs. French said: &quot;I will now ask Mr. Burn tO tell us what ie really got out of the situation, as a result of casting his vote for suffrage ratification.&quot;
In response, Mr. Burn stated that it had Indeed been a great privilege to him finally to suppbrt suffrage, and that he emerged from the fight with a &quot;clear conscience.&quot; Continuing he said:  .
&quot;To the chairman, and, to the or¬ ganizations represented, permit me to say that I appreciate the honor you do me by Inviting me to be present this evening.
&quot;And It Is with much pleasure that I salute those who have acquired 'The New Citizenship' as 'Fellow citizens In the truest sense!&quot;
&quot;The opportunity given the Women ot America, of Tennessee, Of Knox¬ ville, and to the individual, to assist In''placing higher standards in the political world, and to Institute need¬ ed moral reforms, will not be neglect¬ ed. The Interest being manifested proves this assertion to be true.
&quot;Do not understand me tO predict great reforms as sweeping the coun¬ try In a short period, but that with tho ballot as a weapon the correcting measures will 'gradually be applied by the entlrec ltlzenV»lp, men and' women. •
&quot;The credit tor the great reform that produces the opportunity for the women to sheifeiher portion In the struggles that will be .,'fought by means ot the. ballot, belongs to the women themselves, and It Is to them that the suffrage service medal should be given.
&quot;I ampleased that fate gave me an opportunity to -have a small part In making Tennessee 'The Perfect 88th,' but the fact should be recognized that right ultimately triumphs and it Ten¬ nessee had not acted t'nen some other state woud have done so. 'To the credit of the Volunteer States let It bo said-that the majority of tho men In the governing body made of Ten¬ nessee a Ouldlng Star to the women of America who w«re seeking political freedom.
&quot;Since ^The New Citizenship' is the attaining of political liberty^ we may expect personal, domestic, educational and ecohomio rights, for women, to foUow In rapid succession. These will ultlmaOaiy place la which to Uve,
&quot;Tou all have hedrd the fear ex¬ pressed that the good women will not -vote. Let me say that the Women win not, as they never have, endeav¬ ored to escape the perforihance of duty and to vote Is now a duty. And the mothers will not cast their ballot with only the present to be thought of but tor the good ot coming genera¬ tions as well.
Hopes For Better Schools.
&quot;If the new citizenship would re¬ sult In only one thing—better scboola then It would be worth while. Ignor¬ ance-^ what endangers America to¬ day. Proper education so that each woulti understand would do much to abolish the strife between capital and labor, and solve many other trouble¬ some problems. To Wiose-who claim- they tear that social legislation sup¬ ported by the mothers of America will causa unreasonable tax budgets, let me say that the cost of saving Am¬ erican civilization for the world can riot be valued In dollars and cents.
&quot;There are many things I would like to say to you but I have a motto that I try to keep before me when at¬ tempting to talk to others; and that motto is 'Waste not the time of others by trying to tell them something they already know.' aturally, this motto causes me to talse very little ot the time ot this audience!
&quot;I would enjoy telling you what I see In the future of Amerlc» because of the Influence for good that has recently been liberated—tor I am somewhat of a dreamer—but the problems that confront us are stern facts; questions requiring an Imme¬ diate answer; and I am oonfldent the enlightened womanhood ot A&gt;n-

&quot;Therefore  I    would    congratulate you on tho victory you have won and tentative for the great good yOu will do by be- • npme. ing a part of the governing i^ower It °' Knox this great nation!&quot; ¦   Z'^^'^'

Jtrs. Mycr, of Chattanoo/iu, ' spoke on the ladies' auxiliary of the Kiwan- is club th.at has been formed in tTliat- tanooga and the work It is doing. The j'lub has forty-fiye merirbrrs siiid Mrs. Myer.' and Is at present suPPly'&quot;6f eighty-seven children with &quot;millii A ItrainedJn-urse Is maintained by the organiizatioa to visit homes needing mi»dical inspection and treatment.

Mra. Myer stated that the auxiliary was first formed as a social adjunct to the Chattanooga Klwanisi club, but it was soon felt If the organization was to be maintained, there must be some definite objective other thari .'i social one. As a woman'.s n.itural In¬ stincts lead her tb think of the wel¬ fare of the./Vliild, hence the child wel¬ fare worif' was adopted as tlis main objective of the aiixili;ny. A larBo delegation from the cnjajilzationwas present h.t the luiichi'on. and was presented  by  Mrs.  Myer.

Mrs,  '¦   '•    Rutherford  presided at

The ladies o#-the Knoxville Ki Wania Chit) wish to convcv* throiifjli me, as their chairman, to 1410 \'lsit- iiig ladies of the Convention, thei:' very great' pleasure , in being yolir hostess on this occasion; also tlie'lr personal appreciation for such a large attendance. It shows that we are In¬ terested in common' with our hus¬ bands.
. I have nevef seen a body of men so [deeply wedded to .a club as are-*lie Klwanians. I beileve tliere is a great¬ er per centage of real, live, active members in the Kiwanis Club tiian any other organization, and of course we, as the wives, are very proud of this fact. .
Convention    Meant   Much
i doubt if we fully, appreciate and
realize  what  Kiwanis   means  to  our
I men, and I am sure that such con-
1 ventlons as this, where we can work
and  learn  more about Kiwanis,  will
&gt;•   a   great   kiapiratidn   to   us.   As   1
study Kiwanis I am more and- more
Impressed   with   the   fact   that   they
should have s(.)mething like a Ladies'
Auxiliary,, for,I see many avenues in
which we could do good.
r am greeting you all today on be¬ half of The Knoxville Club. X sincere¬ ly hope that you will go away from the convention Just as happy as we are that you came.
.Mrs, Hal Mould, of PlncvlUO^, Ky., responded to the grecling, uxpj-esslng her appreciation of th(; courtesies that the- Knoxville women have extended the visitors and stating that-she and the other guests await an opportunity for returning the hospitality that has been so generously offered them in this city.

WITH 71 CANDLES ON BIRTHDAY CAKE MRS. L CROZIER FRENCH Jll^imCENCES Ojfl THE PAST
A birthday cake with seventy-one candles! That is what will be dis¬ played today at the dln-ner to be given In honor of the seventy-first Ijlrthday pf Mra. L.ucy Crozier French. Seven¬ ty-one years old—and yet as youth¬ ful In manner and as vigorous in mind and body as though she were tnany years younger, Mrs. French la today one of the most interesting per¬ sonages of Knojiville. Her memory Is richly stored with treasures of the pity^s history. And her'B has been no mean part In making Knoxville hls-
torj'.
Born on the site where stands the present building of The Knoxville Sentinel, Mrs. French remembers the time when, Main street was the grpat business district of Knoxville and Gay Its, best residential section. 'When she'&quot;was two, years old her father pur¬ chased the li(?iise where today t&lt;5wora the Farragut Hotel.      The old house
had been built by Mr. Hazen, and Mr. Crozled bought It from Mr. Nlles. The residence wa« surrounded by a fine lawn, bijrdered with sugar maple trees, and hero many a band of sol¬ diers resting In Knoxville while en route to Virginia dui-ln-g the Civil war would lie down in the cool shadows of the trees to sleep.
Had To Move Twice.
Mr. Crozier was a prominent Seces¬ sionist, and whc;n Nashville fell, be¬ lieving that East Tonnesaee would succumb next to the triumphant arms of the north, he moved his family to Atlanta. But after a six months stay there, the Crozier returnea to Knox¬ viUe, where they remained until the approach of Genieral Burnside's army made the fate of KnoxviUe uncertain, when they took refuge In southwest Virginia, at a town then knoMm as tilberty, and now called Bedford City, '
It was two years after the war be-

Branch, of XmoxvtUe, state chairman of the? ¦Woman's Psrtx tor^TOnnessee Is perfecting -h«* «ta;w[»Ooirin wtiewe, »*«••»&lt; the slate, appointing chalrmon and delegating certain duties to differ¬ ent clubs. Osaoll Circle, betnc the oltttot woman's club In the South, has been given the lead in furnish- ing this room.
The bulldlnr as described by Mra. Branch, who recently turned from Washington,. Is beautiful. It was purchased by Mrs. O. H. P. Bel¬ mont and given to the Woman's' Party as a national home. The building 1« on Capitol Hill tmi was used as the United fitaxea capitol in 1913 when the capitol wa« de¬ stroyed by fire. It was from one of the balconies of this mannbn that President Monroe gave his inaugural address.
Mrs. Branch was told that some states 'Were being given the privi¬ lege of furnishing a ^room in this building which could&quot; be used by women of those states when visiting Washington. As Tennessee was the thirty-sixth, and the deaielve, state to ratify the nineteenth ametidment to th« oonstitutlon_(|»BMiMtj MvUeut*
ly fitting that Tennessee should have a room. Mrs. Florence Bayard Hll- les; of Delairare, chairman of the house furnishing committee, ap¬ pointed Mrs. Breach as state chair¬ man for Tennessee.
On suggestion of Mlss Sue 'White ot Jacluoo, Tenn., tt. has been de¬ cided to dedicate the Tennessee room to Mrs. L. C. French because of her work In the interest of women.
Every efort will be made, accord¬ ing to Mrs. Branch, to secure furni¬ ture of colenlal design and authentic history. The history of each piece will be written on a placard an4 placed near ao that visitors can read It at a glance. In addition to the history, of the gift the placard *lll bear the name of the doiior.
As It now stands the room re¬ quires much preliminary ^wwl? be¬ fore it is in condition for furniture. It win be necessary to scrape paint and- repapar walls, work that Is esti¬ mated to cost about »J0O. The wood¬ work Is said to be unusually beauti¬ ful, being of an Inlaid design of mahogany, bird's eye maple, and walnut,
Ossoli Circle Is to appoint a oom- mittee in tho near future to solicit contributions for both money and furniture throughout Kast Tennes-
fore they dalred return In p«ce to Knoxville .where they.now made their permanent home.
Here In the gay period succeeding the war, Lucy Crozier made her debut into society, after completing her edu¬ cation at the Oonvent of Visitation at Georgetown. Knoxville had never en¬ joyed so gay a time as during these years, when the town was full of young soldiers just returned from the war, and every girl had more beaus than she quite knew what to do with. It was an informal stitrfety, with not much money, but there was an abun¬ dance of fun and good spirits. So numerous were the young men that the rule was made that at a dance no one could mak« an engagement for a dance until (he preceding one had been called. This was to give an op- liortnnity to the newacomers In the lown who wished to enjoy the com¬ pany of the girls, and were apf to be crowded out by the boys who had long resided In Knoxville.
Played In Dramatics.
A weekly dance was given by the Young Men's Dancing club at the old Union Bank which stood opposite Ed McMillan's present home on Main street. Mr. Hodgson, brother of Frances Hodgson Burnett, a musical genius of note, and organist at the  Hrst PresbyterlM»' church played «ic piano in the band, and gave to the young people such music as has sel¬ dom been enjoyed sirfce. Mrs. Bur¬ nett was frequently seen at these weekly entertainments. At one time 3lie played the comedy woman's part In &quot;She Stoops To Conquer,&quot; when Mrs. French acted the leading'V-oIe as yilas Hardcastle. So gifted was Mra. Burnett on the stage that tnany of '.ler friends believed that had, she not -ievoted herself to literature-she might easily have attained fame aa an ac¬ tress.
At the age of twenty-one, just fifty years ago today, Lucy Crozier became the bride of W, B. l^ench. The two had grown up together, and after a separation during the war, the old acquaintanceship blossomed into ro¬ mance. A't tliat time Mr. French was tmshier at Cowan McClung's but ia,- ter became the first cashier of the Bast Tennessee Bank,
Onl.v a few months after the mar¬ riage,  Mrs.  French was left a widow

Off£|ers were elected and resolu¬ tions denouncing the present ad¬ ministration and favoring a return to the aldermanic form of govern¬ ment 'were adopted at a recent meeting, of taxpayers of the twen¬ tieth and twenty-first wards, held in the Junior Order ynited Ameri¬ can Mechanics' halU'^
The officers, to Hfc^wthe taxpay¬ ers' mpvement, waWpamed as fol¬ lows: J. V. PfeML chairman; George N. Wagoiiw.t secretary. Executive committeie, B. L. Mon¬ day, chairman ;H.M. Mynatt, Mrs. Roddy, Mrs. Doyle, U. L. Barker, French Brogden, and Tommie Compton. &lt;
The resolution was adopted as follows: ^ ,
^ &quot;First, 'Whereas, the city admin¬ istration has climaxed a long line of blunders in which the people of Knoxville are made the victims of the rankest type of frauS, that they have ever known, with an un¬ just and ridiculous tax assessment. &quot;Second, 'whereas, the result of this assessment, if-it is allowed to stand'will result in wholesale rob¬ bery of the smallhome owners of this community and adjacent com¬ munities.
&quot;Third, -whereas, we have looked upon our city administration'-with tolerance and forbearance,    givinsi our officials every   opportunity/JC make good   their   task   that t^JVj wnicfl tll6 newspapers stand as be¬ ing the only safe course to pursue in any matter relating to our city 3 government,    this     course     aloiy| would lead to relief.   We appe«I jM the city-at-large   for   a safe   a/^ sane leadership to lead the   ho^'-^ owners and the taxpayers of K; ¦ville out of the mire of debt, justice,  broken promises and sonal favorites into which we fallen.
&quot;Fourth,   we   favor   a clean-up of all    the    city oCB b,. with the exceptions of   Coundj-pj Monday, Sterling and Blanc./p,-,
&quot;Fifth, we stand for the I chl dermanic system • of govern evi the plan of our forefatfter* Joff has never failed.&quot; sul

Has woman NO I'LACK in this .sort of politics.
The truth Is: a largo part of the op¬ position to woman suffrage grows, ]f&gt;t, out of a fear on the part of the worst men that woman's vote will Interfere with tlifir sinful practices; and '2ud, out of a disposition on the part of women lo say &quot;ditto&quot; to whatever men niiiy fa¬ vor.

2n(l.    The    second    argument against woman  suffrage  is  that she  Is  untit   to | bear arms in time of war.

(Delly Cbronlrle,. April 8, 18H8.)
Our editorial on wom.vu sullragi'. !:ist J Sunday, having attracted such o.viriior- dinnry uttention, and. we having been repeatedly i'e&lt;iues(ed to jfjve oiir vicrtS of the results of wnman suffrage, do iioi feci entirely at liberty to discoptinuo ilio discussion.
The opponents of woman .siffirage a-'C fond of drawing two pictures: lone repj'i:; sentiug women lowering theipselve.s ii.v el;^'.f giug in all sorts of politjcal ininu r- aliliJY'i', the oilier repri'sciiting base men as staining women's g.iriuents and ehar- iicler in the w hirls of poUlical (gorrup- lioii. ~ .

WoinaiV's vote will be for peace, for Orbltratiou of national difficulties, for keepiuj; the sword sbciithed and the black flag of death, forever fiivlcil.
Tho arms-beiiriug argument means that if woiueu will beionie auiiiisou.s ger hearts of lieuils ami like

then   she   will  appi'«|Hmate- near enough to  tlin greatness Oi  man to be iiriowr.f Uo  vote!
I     If  war  is man's mission and  desliu.i jX.O O'XK would have the rljtlil to vote. Kvery   ipiestioii   would   be   dcciikd   by brute force.
Voting implies that peace is man's niis-.,,- slon  and  destiny,  and  that Intelligence, Sfnre In general (if morality, justice and right are his wer.p- ous.  (!an't  woman use these w»apons',
3rd. The crowning argument wilii many against woman-suffrage is thi' third: that it would not purify politics, but  would   debii.se   her.
This grows out of n misconception of jxilitlcs and is answered under thu liv
would be to promote the wdfiire of ber self, her husband iinil tier children »s human beings rather tiiaii as citizen*^ a nation.

SUSAN B. ANTHONY
fTo thc-cdlfor of the .Suflfrage depurtinenl , of The Jofcifcl and IV-BS^J^p-^SP*-:. Madam:—-Tlie following statement re- ¦garding Susan B. Anthony has appeored in newspapers all over  th-; conntry:
&quot;She WAS uiuilterably &lt;'Pposed to po- Htical partisanshiip, believing that the suffrage could be obtained only through the assistance of its frieude In all par¬ ties.&quot;
Historical evidence does not bear out this  assertion.
In 1869, at t!he first natioTial  conve^i- tion  of  the  Natilonal   Assficiation,   Miss Anthony'.s   position   was   cnunoiated   by the president in tbe following words: &quot;No harmonious    action    on any auestion can ever be secured except as a strict party measure.      Hence ' we appeal to the party in power.&quot; In 1S72,  after    all    the parties bad, i through    tlieir    platforms,    taken then- stand on  the  Woman Suffrage Isue.  nn anpeal was sent out in the name of the National Woman Suffrage association, &quot;¦n'omen  of  the   United  Stales.&quot; it     read,     &quot;the hour    fm'     iiolltlcaJ aotion has come.'    For the first time iu  the hisfor.v  of our country  wo¬ man has been recognized in the plat¬ form of large and dominant party.&quot; The appeal   then  went  on  to explain the refusal of 't'he democratic party and of the  liberal  party.  Under  the  lender- ship of Horace Greeley,  to support the demand  of women,  and closed  Willi  an Impnssioued anpeal to women of all par¬ ties to lay aside all party a ffillatijons and ^ork for  the success of  the republican party.
&quot;Let n.s throw our whole influence of voice and pen Into this campaign and. in making it a succpsk for tlie republican party, make it a success for ourselvefi. Do not liesltAtc. do not vflc'llnte: let no party or persona' rouKiderntion bias you to act flgaiiiet the renublicnn part.v at this niomeii-
totnil crisis.
Kemoraber that we owe. it a debt of gratltudo that it has made for us tliis opportunity, I that it has thus launched our canse ? Into the political arena, where it I must go on aud on, till justice for ; -womeu e^all at la.Ht triumph In a ; true republic; a government of the people, by the people and for the people.&quot;
On behalf ot the National asso¬ ciation, SUSAN B. ANTHONW President. MATILDA JOCBLYN GAGE, Chairman executive committee. ,    Tlie  Hev. Olyuipia Brown,  Who waa one of the leaders of  the  white house denumatration on  March  4tb,  was one | Yet   it of the pioneers wl!o campaigned for the    schooli- republican   party   ht this   campaign   of 1872, as a resolt of that appeal to wo- tiaen. In June, 1872, Miss Anthony said:
&quot;Mjf ^^ew of our trna position, is
to  hold .ourselves as  a :balaiice of
power,  to give aid and cwnfort to
'    any  parfj- wMch shall inscribe on
:   its bannen; 'Freedom for Women.' If
'    I am a   jepu'bUcan    or    liberal or

supporting Ihe piipullst p3rty.
&quot;I have not allied myself with anT party nor shall I all.v   myself wKn. any-party,  save the one of justice and e&lt;inallty for women; bnt the time has coane  when  I  strike,   and  pro¬ claim my contcoipt for the triekoters who put their political  heel on the rights of women at tlie very time when their help is needed most.    I never,    in    my   whole  forty  years ¦work, so utterly' repudiated any sot of politicians as I do those republi¬ cans    of    Kansas,      \&gt;'lieu it Is a mere matter of theory, a  thoneand miles away from a  practical ques¬ tion, they can 'resolve' pretty words, bnt when the crudal mpment comes they   sacrice  ue  without  conscience or  honor.       The  hubbub   with   the repnbBcns  shows    that    they  have been liit In the right place.&quot; IThen,  reasserting that same splendid j.goapel  of  loyalty  of   women   to  women that    she    had     proclaimed     In     1872. twenty-two years before, she said: &quot;I was uever surer of rny position that no self-respecting woman dionld wish or work for the   -iuccesa of a party   that    ignores     her   political rights.&quot;
This was the identical position taken by the Congressional Union and the Woman's party in the recent campaign. It endorsed uo candidste or party; but opposed the party&quot; in power, which, with the-iroTi'er to act, refused by official caucus vote, to old the car.se of women. After reading the paptrs today, and noting the small consideration given to the disfraucliised women who. forgetting the fight of women for women, gave their aid to the democratic party, re¬ gardless of its opposition to their sex. 1 am wondering 'if peiltsps tiiey will not. ponder deeply on Misji Anthony's words of 1872:^^
&quot;T cannot unilersrann how any self rtsspectlug woman can do other¬ wise than refuse lo accept any party that ignores her sex.&quot;

llias I&gt;aura Claj' in ber recent lecturo at MarketHall told a little story In refutation of tho old clmrge that there Would be utt one left at home to take care of the babies if women went to the polls.
A tourist, it seems, wanting to get information at first band in rewird to the workings of equal suffrage in Colo¬ rado, strolled over to the voting place on election day. Presently two women came along, each carrying a baby, and began chatting with a, pleiusant looking invididual 6t the male persuasion, who stood at the door of the building. After a '

disappointing to me. I went to hear the sermon for the purpose of getting a good , J logical, working reason why women should : not be allowed to vote. The text I. Cor. 11-a, &quot;But 1 would have you know that the head of every mau Is Christ, and that the head of the woman'Is the m.'vn,- and j the head of Christ Is God.&quot; This nxiy—I | say tt may—refer to douicstlc relations lu the mind oC the writer. 1 do not pretend to enter Dr. llronghton's own -domain and liiteqjrct the lipostle for hlui, but I won¬ der why he did not take for his text I. rCor. 1,4. i-X&gt;, 'M.ct your Women keep sil¬ ence 111 the ciMii'clii-s; for It is not per¬ mitted unto theui to speak; bUt they are coniniauded to be under obedience as also salth thi' law.

This certainly Is one ste'p removed from the   home,   and   the    prohibition     here   Is plain   anl   positive,   yet   a   literal   applica¬ tion  ot   this  would  not  be allowed  In  the doctor's  own   church.

Democracy WAS   not   known   to   I'uul,   though   perhaps the  fn-eilom of    the' Indivldunl  hud    been dreamed  of  by  some  of   the   Grecian  and Uoiuan   stutesuieu.   ; in   I'aul's     day     the man's  relation  to the goverunient  was   to pay   his  tax  and   be  silent  about   the  ad- mlulstratlou of public affairs.    He nowhere referred   to  any   participation   of   his   own in   affairs   of   state.     There   U   no   &quot;tally sheet&quot; to'shoxy that he ever voted.   &quot;Blnce lie   took   no. part   In   governmental   affairs except   to  declare  that   &quot;the   powers   that be are ordained of Goil,&quot; wc could,hardly presume,  though he Was Inspired, that his 1} Writings could  have any  relation   or  bear¬ ing  upou  polltl(,'al  matters,  except from a standpoint   of  general   morals.     We   might \, as   well   say   he  forbade   a   high   tariff   or I the  tierman submaTlne warfare as  to say ]f he forbade woniuii suffragt-.    But It would '¦' seiiu In harniony with I'aul's logic In splr- IIual   teaching  for  hlui     to  declare   in  the light   of  preseut   day events   that   If     the j woman Is held to be amenable to the law j In  Its  civil,and  crlmluul  upplli'atlon,    she | should   have  a   voice   In   making   that  law. | It Is as logical  that Gideon's  request that j- [I the  sun  stand   still   until    he  fought    his i !' hittth-s   ptoves   that   the   siiu   moves   about   , Uie    earth   as   it    Is    to   declare    that   he texl   fo.rliade yvomau   suffrage.

She, not oelug able to defend (he issues of the ballot by physical strength; or, lu other words, as aue can¬ not shoulder her musket and march on to war by the&quot; side of her brother, she should Jiol i&gt;e allowed to go to the ballot box with blni.

NATION RIDICULES FAMOUS DIVINE
Says Anti-Suffrage Logic of Dr, Lyman Abbott is Neat and Be¬ witching^
\
Dr. Lyman Abbott, in his re¬ cently published &quot;Reminiscences,&quot; expresses deep aflfection for his .jvife, but says: &quot;She loyally sup¬ ported my views, even when she did not share them, and w6 were of one mind.&quot;
The Nation of Jan. 27 com¬ ments on this point as follows': &quot;llow natural is Dr. Abbott's op- pusition to, woman's suffrage! Put into words, the argument ly¬ ing impUcitly beneath this state¬ ment would run somewhat as fol lows: The well-regulated man and wife arc of one mind, even when they do not think alike, and tliut mind is the husband's. Therefore, it is sure of perfect expression if the husband does the voting. One may accept or reject the conchl|ion, but the log¬ ical n^llliiillllJllljiijiiutncnt is bcw

STATE DELEGATIONS JOIN PtCXET^LINE
AT THE WHITE HGjiSE^
; Dtiegatlons from- three states ctnic Jrtst week to take their place In tbo plcke* guard stationed ,b.v, the concres- sional Union In front of the White Honse to show the President that the women of the country are waiting for him to aot on tbe federal amendment before the end of the 64th congress.
Moiiday was Distflct of Cohimbla day as It is eacli week. Pennsylvania day, Thursday tlie 24tli, brought from that state »u enthusiawtic group of women eageii to stand sentinel all day till night¬ fall, Tlicy were, however, divided Into squads-that served in regular turns until four o'clock, when the whole long line was stretched across the front of the while house from gate to gate, reiter¬ ating with Ihelr banners the question that keeps the congressional imion •taudlng guard, &quot;ilr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?&quot;
The \ew York delegation on Jannary 26 carried on-thoir banners phrases from President Wilson's book, &quot;The New Freedom.&quot;
&quot;lilberty Is the fnndairiental  ile- hiaud of the human spirit.&quot;
&quot;We are interested in Uie United States, politically speaking, in noth¬ ing but human liberty.&quot; Twenty-four women came down from New York to join the picket line on one of the coldest and most blustering days fA. the .year.    They  stood etauncnly on guard,   however,   wind-whipped   but   se¬ rene, calling the President's own words to his attention when l«e came In iste in the afternoon.
Virginia day, Saturday, teoaglit a group of delegates who had made a long over-night Journey by boat ami train to &quot;prove that the women of this most con¬ servative state are taking their part in the movement for federal suffrage.
Plans are proceeding for the demon- stratldn In whi&lt;?h the picketing will cul¬ minate on March 4th. At twelve o'clock on that day President Wilsoji will take the oath of office at the capitol. Mrs. Bohert Baker le arranging far a great &gt;| delegation of voting women, supported by non-voters, to meet him after the oath ha« been taken to protest againet his first term's having gone out without action on the federal amendment and to ask that he begin, his new texni by In¬ itiating legislation which will bring about the passage of the-aiea&lt;*ure.
Indignation Spreads,
In the meantime indiguatiou was spreading like a furious fire throiij,'li all classes of citizens and by morning Wash¬ ington wa« ablaze with righteous wrath. AdTocates of the women took up their case in the senate and the hou.sc, and passed resolntions demanding an InvesU- yation of the shameful failure to furnisn the necessary guards. Already hnu-1^ dreds of Jetters, petitions and re.solution.s f from prominent people all over Uie coun¬ try, have been i-ecelyed by Lleuienant .Hobson, -who has constituted himself tlie cuaiutuvn of the sutfragists. Thus ended the first national suffrage parade so long iu the planning, so arduous, iii the execution. But as Dr. Shaw saysc if antl-suffragists, women or men, think &gt;e frightened by the un^eem- f a hostile ft»ob they are very ken.

The- formerMianiplonM the cause bt equal suffrage, while the,; latter voiced her reasons for being op¬ posed to gi^fiug the hallot to women.
Although tbe cause of equal suffrage in Ivnoxvilie has^een upheld on nnmer^ one occa.«Ionw by earnest imrtisans, It witr the firat time that the &quot;antis&quot; had ballon advocate on a local rostrum, and the debute was one Of the most Interest¬ ing ever lield here.

&quot;As a patriot,&quot; the speaker continued,
&quot;I give way to none.    There nre various
ideas of patriotism.    My idea Is one of
love   and   reverence   for   the   principles
upon which onr government Is founded..
Much do I honor and revere the prin- j ciploB of our government, which I hold
to be  a  governraeut of  the  people,  by

&quot;Wc hold these truths to be self- evident,  that all  men  are created equal;  that they   are  endowed  by this creator with certain unalienable rit-'hts,  that among these,   are life, liberty and tlie pursuit of happiness; that to secure'these rights, govern¬ ments nre Instituted among men de¬ riving  their joat  powers  from  the Consent of the governed; that &gt;vhen- ever  any  form  of government  be¬ comes destructive of these ends, it is the right ot the people to alter .: or to aboiish it, and to institute new government,  laying  Its  foundations on such  principles,  and  organizing its powers in such form as to them as sbaU seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.&quot; Anotlier Quotation was given from the declaration of rights of 'Tenncsseq, and the   speaker  declared   that  iipon   these sho  would   base her argument  for  the enfranchisement of women.
&quot;Alany ideas, said the speaker, had been advanced as to whether all men are born firee and equal. Many hold that .they are not. and that the rich and the poor are not equal. I hold that no government shall do aught to prevent ever.v human being,bom Into the world.

Ancw and ainttsing feature of the cou- test-s over equiil suffrage in u\any Jegis- laliire.s   this   year   i.s   the   eagerness   of
imemliers to make party capital  out of
, ths^qiicatjon.    The more for-Highted men
jin ail parties see that women are going
jto:got   the   ballot.     However   oyposird
Ithey may iHjrsonally be to equal .suf,be called frage. and however desirous to Ktave itfafter marriage, wouldn't a few com', off 111! the last miuiile, they do not .. „,,„„_ „-^„ („¦&gt; tthvo a hMirr-'i want their parlv to incur the ill „.,ii| | PUcationa creep in?

Now It occurs to ua that it ' is mighty hot weather to be fussing aibout such trlffles. If Ruth Hale refuses to be called Mrs. Broun, Witat the heck do we care, but why try to sot a lot of other women by the ears about thla matter?

And what of the children, It any aind why so? Mr. Jones and Miss Smith, being legal husband and wife, | have offspring. What name does said ofts|n-ing take, for certainly Miss Smith, having suih pride in her name, never would consent to, having the little darling called Jones and Mr. Jonea, if he be any kind of , a father at all. will seriously ob¬ ject to anything but Jones. Maybe, thi&gt;y could call'him or her Jone.i- Smith. But, supose a Jones-Smith, grown to maturity, shc^M nia(-ry a Brown-White, would the child of that union be forced to bear fOur names? The League says no, that the child should bear the name of either the mother or the father, tho parent:! agreeing at Its birth.
After all. It make small difference, In our opinion, what the Lucy Stone League believes. But It does rathe;' strike at the foundation ot clvilly.a- tl«n, the family, and the family, heaven knows, has had many blow-. delivered at It In recent years, yet The Journal and Tribune has rather abiding faith in tbe common sense of the great mass of the people and mich frills as that advocated by thla t«««ue are merely rlpiries on the j ocoim of Hte, a cause for merriment

But have we not noticed that as soon as (and   before)  a   new  duty   arrives    for woman those who have kept pace with Its  progress are  ready  to assist those who are Ignorant t»f Its full exercise? The recent victory In New Tork has -  brought forth eulogies from many lead¬ ing.iournals on thO'splendid and mast¬ erly  organization 'of women,  who con¬ ducted, the cijimpatgn, eliciting the sur- 1   prise and admiration of well known lead- i   ars ill politlcalllfe.

THE VOTE AND &quot;niK VOTER.
(By Ifary Sumner Boyd) ¦What is CtttzenshlpT For tho time be¬ ing, ; in order to have a working defini¬ tion, we will say that cltlsena are ot two kinds; full or &quot;active&quot; citizens who have, both political and civil rights, and partial or &quot;passive&quot; citizens—these will give us some trouble later—who have olvll rights alone. Only as citizen of a state can an Amerlean have full citizen¬ ship for only tn this way can he have voting rights. But only as a citizen,of the United States does he gain the fun¬ damentals of civil rights.
With   certain   Important   limitations, the federal  constitution leaves to the states the decision as to who shall be full voting citizens and who shall not. On their pait, the states with the ex¬ ception of eight,  in conferring voting citizenship lay down as one requirement that a voter must have first of all that degree of citizenship which the United States government alone can give. The sight exceptional states (Arkansas, Oela- . 'ware,   Indiana,  Kansas,   Missouri,   Ne- I braska, Bouth Dakota and Texas) give I voting rights to iaiens who have tak I en out their f^rst papers, &quot;declared theU- 1 Intention&quot;  to  become citizens of    the •pCnitod States. Among Jurists there is I doubt aa to whether these statoa have I not assumed a power to which they have no right   In   allowing  persons  not  yet naturalised to vote for members of con¬ gress. A case haa never come to federal courts however, and the federal consti¬ tution. In the first of-Its four Important references to voting qualifications, spe- oiflcally provides that electoral quaHfl- cattons In respect to congress shall 1)0 teti to t'ne states. Article I, Section 2, -ttt'itoe Constitution of the United States says:    &quot;The   house   of   representatives shall be composed of members chosen . , . by the people of the several states and  the  electors  in   each   state   shall have the quallftoatlons for oloctors of the most numerous branch of tho state lagislaturo.&quot;
In only two raspoots, ono minor and ono major, does the federal constitu¬ tion control voting citizenship. Of pros- Uantlal elections, Arttele II, Section 5, •ays: &quot;Each stata shall appoint in such manner as tho lagiidaturo thereof shall docroe. a number of electors.&quot; Tho United States dooroos that not the oloc¬ tors onumoratod by sUto constitutions but thoso doDldod on by tho sta^o legls- UUuros shall oloot tho president of the United States.
Tho major limitation on tho states' P&quot;'^?'&quot; ^„''*J«&quot;&quot;'&quot;'' Totlnir citizenship la th« XV Ataandtnent of tho United Stato. ConMttOtion. &quot;The right «r WtJ.

should ba ono concrete result. Thus an education In voting essentials oould bo carried to clvlo centers, to community meetings in school houses, to existing aooietles, to groups of women of differ¬ ent spheres, localities, customs and languages, to the end that What Every Woman Voter Should Know may bt carried to Every Woman Voter.

Historically this amondment was pre¬ ceded by Article XIV, Section », which attempted Indirectly to glvs tho fran¬ chise to male negroes in respect to Csd- eral offl'?lals and legislators by provid¬ ing that reprasentatlon In congress should be I'eduocd in the same propor¬ tions na the number of male citizens twenty-one years and over, denied the franchise by a state bears to tho whole number of male citizens of voting ago I in that state.

TBB WOMAN'S PABTY IN TftE BNITBD
STATK8 (Traaslatsd from tbe ItalUui- of sa Artlel* In   &quot;i.-JC»«c»&quot;  Borne,  Italy   Fab.   1«,  U19)
One of the most Interesting of American KDclnl movements i» certainly that of tke v.'ubion, wbo bwe formed hers a rtal party ot their own, active and powerful both jii those stales Ia wbleb they vote (about one-balf) and Sa those In which they do mit vet  vote.
it Is not possible to be long In''Amer¬ ica today without hearing the &quot;(&gt;|ckets&quot; spoken of, at times' with harsh severity, and at others with 'the highest and most sincere eDtbaslasm, even on the part ot men.
Aiiytlilus which ttxcttes such diversir of opinions end seKtlments cannot tell, to arouse tha Interest of one who studile* a glveu country. &quot;The Pickets,&quot; the name which fiimlllarly distinguishes the mem¬ bers of the National Woman's party, are iiiit cxceptloua t» this rule. This party which constitutes the most active sec¬ tion &quot;f tbe .suffrage movement In Amer¬ ica, fcpresents a partlcnlarly Interesting phase ot tbe political activity of the wom¬ en of the Vtitted States.
,fl'he KatWoal Womaii's party was form¬ ed a few imurs ago by tho younger and more iirllli,.;&gt;t siilrts of the &quot;National Woman's Kutttage Association of Amer¬ ica,&quot; Under the active direction of Miss AlUe I'aul. a fiuinll band of criimders bo- came convinced that for effective propa¬ ganda and BucaxNful political action It was neeesaary to^ use more direct and mors energetic mothodii. It was out of a acMsm over thU guesilon ot methods that there developed thi- Katlonal Woman's Party,, nltli a i|ulto dcllnlte plan ot action, un¬ der the clever ,leadership—and, we may Hay, Nomonbat autocratic Icadershlp^of Mlssi .\lli-e I'sul. who had learned polltl- lal strategy ami drawn Inspiration from lier expBrlence.f In the pre-war csni- palgUK of the 'English suffrsglsts.      '
During the war, the continued prona- gniida and agitation of the National Worn-. Hn's 'Party served only to Increase the ani¬ mosity of tUeIr enemies. The siplrlt which animates this lU'defstigable bund of women, the spirit which I.'* eltaractertstic of   tbo   methods   they   employ   Is   ono   of

I'.eKUlnrly for ninny years the amendment iias I'.eeii iire8**iited to congress, and as I'egiil.'i.'iy btifi heen defented.

ITor this reason they coiicentPate tnelr efforts upon the Federal government, and more especially upon tha President himself, «s the head of that gov- eriiiiient. Theflr hold the President respon¬ sible' for the pRsnage of the amendment, bei'«u«e-^-lf he will he has sufHclent pow- c&quot; to urge and almost to compel Its sp- provai, and they believe that It they Sou- ociitrate all their attack upon him he will ead  by  taking up their cause.
Their strategy- well known In military science^ Is that of coitcentratlng tbe great¬ est possible llor&lt;'e upon a single point of sttsek; and to this end they have sought to draw the attention of the whole coun¬ try lipon the question of enfranchisement by cooailtutlonsl s&quot;meudnient. They wished to create In the nuhllt' mind the convictioni that tho President was chiefly rosponslble for tbU right, and that bo could gnat or withhold It.

Hurrah!
Women have 'won their fight!
Hats off to Tennessee solons 'Who have made thla the &quot;Perfect Thirty- Sixth State&quot; and granted women of America, the right to vote and parti¬ cipate th the government of the coun¬ try!
Those expressions of rejoicing 'were voiced hV Knoxville women when In¬ formed &quot;by The Knoxville Sentinel this afternoon that suffrage had been ratified by the legislature, altho'ugh a reconsideration of the action of today is suggested as likely to be pro¬ posed. !
Enthusiasm and exultation over the victory was all the greater, because niany suffrage leaders had despaired , of a victory after announcement from   ^^^ North   Caollna   last   night     that  the °
senate there had defeated the move- ment.
Announoement of the triumph came generally as a surprise to Knoxville women. Many who had not given up hope had thought action on the ques¬ tion might be postponed and tho , emancipation of women delayed
All agreed that it means the dawn of a new day for America and the world. I
MRS. SARAH    HENRY    HOOJD— , f     I ra   perfectly   delighted.   I   haven't had anything to make ma so happy m years.   The passage of thla ratlfl- cation measure means that Tennessee !   again has  the proud  distinction,  as i   at King's Mountain,  at turning  the I   tide  of  battle  to  a  victorious  con¬ clusion of American Independence &quot;    ' ,    MISS ADA rANZ—&quot;I'm just glad that It has came about.    That Is all , that I can  say. but I certainly am glad    that    it h^a gone    through at i    last.   I have been out of active suf¬ frage work for several years,  buti 1 rejoice   over   the   victory   just   the I'same.&quot;
.,   _   MRS.  R, E.  L. MOUNTCASTLE— i     Good!    Grand!    Toun don't mean it Tennessee is In line with Its past re¬ cord of being the original volunteer state.    She pame into the union un¬ der  difficulties.    She saved the  day ;   for American independence at King's vMounUln,    She was the last state to ¦secede from the Union at the time Of the civil war.    She was the first state to be   re-Instated.    Th*   uniqueness of the position of Tenneifsee In history has becon^e even more apparent afters this last Victory in which it turned , the tide for the Independence of Amer loan  women.   I personally am more thart grateful to the members of the ¦ legislature 'tvho voted for the amend¬ ment,  and  I  feel  that  the  suffrage workers both democratic and republi¬ can, sbould be most thaiikful for the %, favors   received   from   both   partlea 'fl|Bi« ^^wnen-trsiv e ¦ luugut.^ttymr ^*!f^ .all  occasion  for  suffrage, and  have !   been awake to their every responsl- Iblllty.&quot;

to bring out the girls along with the boys.
.Began ^Lifo Forty Years Ago
FroTO hfer girlhood days , Mrs. French had,been an admirer of Susan B. Anthony and the other original suffrage leaders, and as far back as forty years' ago, 'when to be a suf¬ fragist was regarded, in the soi^th as being a freak she began to plan to- *vard Introducing the cause in Knox-
Miio.     ,   .'       ,    .,_
For many years she stood ^ImOst alone as far as Knox'vllle was con¬ cerned buti throughout the state at large the entering wedge    for'   suf
_ een  experiencing    that    the    antls
of completing' the 'ratrf7catkm&quot;pro'gni.rn ilwould win and force .ub| to fight the
i
came to Tennessee. Every woman should be very happy over the result of tho fight at NaahviUe.&quot;
MRS. N. E. LOQAN—&quot;Isn't It won¬ derful? I have jupst heard i It and it (seems too good to be true. Every '.lope seemed to be lost last nighti and now jhere comes, the victory! I feel that women can hold up their heads now and act like real people.&quot;
MISS LOXiJISE BIGNALt,—&quot;What: What again! So we got It? What was the majority? Well, even If It wasn't a big majority we got. It. How we did It and by what majority doesn't make anay difference.&quot; i
illSS JENNIE IRWIN.—''ts fhat so! Well that is just fine. II just think that Is great, 1 think everything of it. Hurrah for the legislature. 1 can't think of anything, good enough to say.&quot;
MRS. H. E. CHRIS'TBN'BERRT—&quot;I shall send a telegram to Mrs. Annie Cottrell Waver and Mrs. Ethel King, who are In Nashville In the interests of suffrage. 'The telegram reads: 'Con¬ gratulations. EitpresB our regards to the  legislators.^ V
MRS. T. P. MILLER—&quot;Is It really true? Has the house really passed the ratification resolution? Really? Truly? It seetns dlflfcult to believe, after the claims of tho antls yesterday and last night, and after the rebuffs our suf¬ frage WI, kera have had. And yet how glorious! What a w'onderful victory! How It will bring glory to dear old:«en- nessee! I am incapaible of exi'/.ssing my! .great gratitude tothe splendid men in the legislature, whose support and votes have made possible this wonder¬ ful victory! It means the dawn -of a better day for America and for the wcr'd, that women are to have the bal-'
an atithoriy^two #«mtii5r:iiir iWoiiaW 'i tion,.    How happy suffragists should  Jt today!&quot; ¦   ^
MRS. SOPHIE HUNTER—&quot;Oh. isn't It awful. I Just think that we women will have to go to the polls and talt&lt; part in yours old poliii.'S. I regret the action of the legislature. Women should stay at hothe Instead of hB'Vlng the vote. But I suppose It is all right, as wo are eln the 'march of what Some call 'progress.' &quot;
MRS. J. L. MORGAN-&quot;Well, 1 hope those women who have sought the vote will be happy. I have been content l)o leave th6 voting to the men. However, now that the women have the vote, i I hope tho results will be for the great good of the nation.&quot;
MRS. J. MARION MILLER—&quot;Has suffrage really passed? All right. No, I have nothing to say. We'll really go to Work now; '^fon't we? We'll get busy and see what we can do.&quot;.
MISS HASSIE GRESHAM—&quot;It Is simply a lyorklng out of justice. Some¬ times it tkkea a long time for justice to be obtained, but sooner or later.lt will come.   I am very highly delighted.&quot;
MRS. WALTER STARNES NASH— &quot;I think the eyes of all America were on Tetuiesse. and now that the legisla¬ ture has actually ratified th eamend- ir.ent the wom;n from all over the coun¬ try will feel grateful to those who put ratification through.&quot;
MISS BLIZABMH TURNER—&quot;That Is certainly fine. I thought Tennessee would not fall her women when the cbance came to give them the vote. I am so glad.&quot;
MRS. EMMA RICE—&quot;Well, that Is fine. 1 think that Is the greatest thing Tennessee has done in many years, greatest thing for the women of the state and th* women of the nation. 1 any difference

Views On Equal Suffrage
LOCAL SUFFRAGIST IS INTERVlFWED IN BlRMU^iGHAM ^   AND EXPRESSES HERSELF FREELY ON THE M-' TIONAL AND STATE PHASES OF THE ISSUE.
I
In the Birmingham Age Herald of Tuesday, August 18th, there appears an interriew by Dolly llalrj'niple, the well known new.'&lt;paper writer, with Mrs. I.. tl Cnraier-Freuchli who hn.s juat returned I from a visit witli her son, Mr. William j French, of Birnilnghnni. The interview is accouiponied by a splendid likeness of Mrs.   French  and     is    in    part  as  fol-
BY DIXY DALKYMPLE.
Mrs. ll. ('ror.ier French, the disting¬ uished president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage assoeiationfi who lia.s been among the prominent visitors to Birm¬ ingham during the past few days, needs no introduction to the people of this community.
, Mrs. French is widely known as one of the most Intellectuol. one of the most forceful, oue of the brainiest and one of the most charming women whom the south delights to honor.
4s president lof the Equal Snffrago as¬ sociation of the grand old state of Ten¬ nessee, Mrs. French has become known not only nationally, but internationally, and her work in l&gt;chulfIof tbe cause has given her precedence and .prominence wherever intelligent men and women are assembled. Mrs. French Is the type of woman who is distinctly frtninine and insistently human. ,.
With all her splendid intelligence and learning, she has the warmest note of sympathy hiildeu away in her heart—the kindliest, consideration for her fellow- wan—a spirituality tbat i. Is surpassing J,irweet, and a strength which is doiiii- aeetiog as she baa ia the pioneer that She spomters tremcpdous-op- J tion, but always able to qopc with ¦ft—always able to win.
One of her greatest admirers, a young woman of dclightfijl,personality and en¬ gaging charm, has liald of Mrs. French that &quot;she Ss made of the finest feminine fabrics,&quot; and that if she were asked to tu sum up her one biggest quality in the variations of her make-up, in a sin¬ gle short sentence, she would sajr:—
&quot;She is the most heroic type of tnoral courage I hove eVen seeu.&quot;
Mrs.   French ,    chatted]   interestingly
With me a few {days ago -about suffrage
and its progress in the south. '
j.     She talked of Mr. Bryan's declaration
&quot; for suffrage as A distinct forward move-
fiment for the cause. .
She talked of the'^Wnigressionai union
und its position  in suffrage ranks,  that
the One note of militancy tbat had ever
been struck in tlie United States (which
by  the   way, 'she  declares, eould  never
f exist as it does in England, because the
' conditions  could never  by any  possible
I means be the same)  had been sounded
by  this organizatiou.
.She remarked ujwn Mr. Wilson's at- tihide toward suffrage n.s uot surprising to her in its conservatism, since in his ofificial position as I're.sideiit of these United States he has not before been called upon to inaugurate any measure 80 radical, any measure so l.irge, any measure that meant so much to so many people.
She spoke of the self-sacrifice that tho women who are espousing the cause of suffrage are making In order to enable II them to raise funds for the work, and .the tribute of selecting the birthday of hucf Stone as &quot;Self Sacrifice Day&quot;— the day upon which tbey amalgamated in this purpose, as timely and apropos. She talked of many interesting pluises of suffrage, nnd she was, particularly happy ill her delineation' of the tense sitnatiou in her own home state.

Social Borvico is woman's natural field of action and in ever larger and i larger numbers are' th«w coming for-' ward to enlist for tho struggle for bet¬ ter conditions. The most thoughtful and best informed aro examining Into existing conditions and informing themselves as to the laws upon our statute books concerning women and children. Alas, In this state, the code ': contains most inadequate legislation ror the projection of women and chil¬ dren.
At tlte mothers' congress held In Nashville, March 28 ana Z9, recom¬ mendations w»re made nnd resolutions passed endorsing no less than a dozen bills for passage by the legislature, all concerning the protection ot women and children. \ special commltteo was appointed to see that the necessary steps were taken to &quot;huve these meas-

Ploaaa allow  me  to  thank you     for ndlng   the   paper  containing   the   do- Ion of the Tennessee court reganling rapro.    I  have enjoyed reading it. a'm in Birmingham only over Sun- returning   to   Montgomery  tomor- for although, wo had an  unfavor-
o one will doubt that this Joui-ral will ,  conducted    on  bread  and    educatJ've -.es and that It will be a potent factor , promoting good government. Mrs. French's alms will be to arouse the ^ople  of her  city to certain  conditions hat   now   exist  and  she   asks JCo-opera- m   Vn   the   effort   to   rescue   municipal d county affairs from the hands of the rtlsan politicians,  be- they Republicans _.   Democrats.   She   believes   that   for   a people to allow partisans to manage, their Municipal and county affairs is  to sub- ilt to be made victims of the spoVls sys- &gt;m.    Mrs.    French's    Journal,    In   other ords Is to be devoted to &quot;the Weallzlng f the real ond the realizing of tbe Ideal.&quot; mong tbe pertinent questions asked by Jrs.   French,   and  which   may  strike   a lesponslve chord  In many  cities are  the fllowln^: ¦Wliy should the Sunday closing law be ^iforced   against   stores   In   general   but |ot against barrooms? Why   was  the  office! of   ppllce; matron .bolished,   aftpr having been  In  success- Ill   operation   for   ten   years?   Abolished, Jotwithstanding   the   earnest   protest -of tnoxvllle's best citizens.
(Why Is It that we have not enaugh oney to make our public schools What ley should be?
Why Is It that we have not even one [ttle plat of ground' for a resting place
1 thp heat of summer?
Why IS It that the ordinances In re¬ tard to the keeping of our streets free f filth are ndf In atiy degree enforcM?
It Is because the people have not or-
anlsed.
It Is because the people have not said |3 tjie officials, &quot;You must do your duty!&quot;
It Is because the people, have; not sali b tbe ring leadens, &quot;Thu» far shalt thi 'lo  and no farther.&quot; '

1/helmingly passed by the house Fri- ay  fractures   the  equality  principle two respects. It will give the wo- len tjie fi'anchi'se only in a limited ay,  and it relieves  tbo sex of    tho 1-erequii^ite   condition   of   paying   a bll tax  ua one of the qualifications \&gt;v voting.  This   was  a  gallant  act the part of thc,1eKi.slators but we' !r,^vely doubt Its      wladpm. The re¬ eving of women from the necessity paying  a   poll' tax   for  voting  In tial  elections   may  tend  ser- o  unbalance  , the    Tennessee te as   now  cdr.stltuted.  Quite derable  element  of our.imalo' Ion  (lo .not  consider  it  worth | nrjertt of the »2 poll tax to ,ex- thelr     manhood i   privilege  of g their b.allots.  Many  of these ax   dellnciuents,   however,   have relatives    or      Connections whom    they    ma:y  deem  fit
nhlid.
Mothers learned that little girls who have been assaulted undergo addi¬ tional wrongs during the trials. They ask, therefore, that the Judgs and the interested attorneys decide what evi¬ dence is relevant and admlssable be¬ fore examining girls who have been •tssaultcd. They deBlr« that a woman should be permitted lo accompany the
for a share when number one has all &quot; a desires.

We have found many of Mrs. p. Graham Crozier's articles jvell worth printing, and have klways given her space in the herald to express her views. Jut we are not at all in accord rith her in her views regarding latty Arbuckle. We are consid- rably disappionted in the action he has taken as a member of tio &quot;Better Films&quot; conmiittee f Knoxville. Recently the com- utte« passed resolutions calling ki the local theatres to refuse lie^ Arbuckle fi\ms entrance to heir theatifM, :«With the ex- bption of Ws. Oroziw, the club [as unanimous in asking it. Irs. Crozier comes out in de¬ fense of Arbuckle, saying that In the name of justice&quot; he hould be permitted the game ights   a? before his trial   for

In tho report of the action ot the Better Films committee Fiiilay on the Arbuckle case, which waa given no doubt, by a member of tlui-t, com¬ mittee, my position was Incon-ectly repdrtod. I made no plea for Ar- i&gt;ucide personally, and eo statvJ moBt lemphatloally. Much -might be said In a plea for mercy and Chri.st lan chainlty for this man, but I made no such plea.

Mrs. KreiH'li is witlely known as one of the mo.«t rntolleetual, one of the most forceful, one of the brainiest andv one of the most charming women whom the south il.'lighls to honor.

©ne of her greatest admirers, a yoijiig' woman 6f delightful personality and en¬ gaging charm, has said of Mr..). French! that &quot;she Is made of the llneet feminine fabrics,&quot; and that If she were asked to suni tip licr one biggest quality In tiie variations of her m»ke-up. In a single short sentence, she would say:'
&quot;She Is the most h»tole type of moral courage I have ever seen I&quot;
Mrs. French chatted Interestingly with me a few days ago about suftrage and its progress in tbe south.
She talked of Mr. Bryan's declaration for suffrage as a distinct forward move¬ ment for tbe cause.
Sbe talked of the Congressional Union and its position In sulTrage ra'nks. tliat the one note ot militancy that had ever been struck In the United States (which, by the .way, she declares could never ex¬ ist ao it does in England, because the conditions could never by any possible means be the same) bad been sounded by this organization.
Sbe remarked upon Mr. Wilson's atti- tura toward suffrage as not surprising to ier in. its conservatism, since in his ofti- Olal position as President af these United States be ha.B not before been called upon to Inaugurate a'ny imeasure so radical, f-anyjineasure so large, any measure tbat
hmeant so much to,so many people.
She spoke of the Etlf sacrifice that tbe women wbo are espousing the cause of suffrage are making tn order to enable them to raise funds for the work, and the tribute of selecting the birth day ofj

&quot;As to the opposition,&quot; I suggesti.d ¦¦at the present time In Tennessee, to what Is U mainly attributable?&quot;' I asked.
&quot;The oppb.sltlon to the enfranchisement- of 'Women In Tennessee Is mainly apolo¬ getic at this moment, it is not of an apa¬ thetic nature, or negative character. The trite threadbare phrase, 'Woman's place \s In  the home'   (which,  by the way,  no
lone' has ever disputed/ is uttered jiarrot- Hke by tliuso who Keem. unable to, riut forth any. logical argument against equal

&quot;No organized effort, I understand, bas been put forth by tbe men of Tennessee lor suffrage,&quot;, 1 observed.
&quot;Many of Tennessee's leading men have Indorsed woman suftrage, although, as you have suggested, no organized effort bag been tastltuted,&quot; Mrs. French re¬ plied.    &quot;The  men of  our  commonwealth

One of the most Interesting polijts, psychologically considered, in the rela¬ tion of the sexes. Is the contrast be¬ tween man's mental attitude to woman and her copditlon as expressed on dif¬ ferent times and under different condi¬ tions In language polite either written or spoken, In editorials, essays and.^ poems or   In   toasts   at   banquets,   ad-
&quot;The Principles of Government Ap¬ plied to Women's Enfranchisement&quot; U the   subject   of   a   paper   by   Mr»&quot;.     U Crazier French, president of the Knox¬ ville     Equal    .Suffrag«f League.     Mrs. IFrenoh has read widely on the subject Iwhlch she treats logically In this paper, (answering    the     common    arguments iagalnst  suffrage  with  arguments  that looted statesmen and orators have used |1n pleading for national Independence. '   ¦:   The subject Is one that Is attracting widespread attention and the following paper Is one that should provp of gen- ,&lt;Tai interest,
(    The paper Is as follows: __ ^
I'tmng rroic • £it. tne   raot  that     mkny joinen  have  neither   father,   hu8l&gt;and, l[rothers or cousins.    But let   us   hear .franklin   on   this  sort  of   representa¬ tion:      &quot;They  who  have  no  voice  nor vote in the electing of representatives do   not   enjoy   liberty,   but   are   abso- jlutely  enslaved   to  those   who     have votes and to their repreaerttatlves,   for| to   be  enslaved   t«  to  have   governors'' whom other men have set over us. and i be subject  to   laws rnado by the rep resentatlves of  others, without haying j.i had representatives of our own to givj fl '\ coninent In our behalf &quot; J
Distasteful  aJs   th^  statement  Is    toh en that women are politically slaves, he   fact   must    be   acknowledged     oy , I yessonable people,  •re're la wH«u^4*Hre3'| t)tls says of the sort of representation ¦ '. jl'omen   have   had:     &quot;No  such   phrasd Js  virtual    representation     was    ever known   In  law  or  constitution. « It  la altogether    a    subtlety    and    lliiislnii. wholly   unfounded   and   absurd.      Wo \ must  not  be  cheated   by    any    sucli phantom or other trick of law or pull- tics.&quot;     If no   man  can represent    an.&gt; other   man,   how   much    less  can   any man   represent   a   woman? ,,Can   any man represent the feelings of a niolli-j pr'.'     Tho    most     tretiiieut . obJ.f&quot;ct!on f one    hears    urlfed    against    tbe    on-, franchlsement  of  wotnen  Is   that   pol¬ itics   Is &quot;too  cprrupt for  good  vvoineu | to taKeujpart in.    Coiild any. reason   bei more alfeiird?    Women  must  live  ui.-i der tho government conducted by these' bad  politicians.     If   women    are      liioj better, why liot let them try to  iiiaka I some   Improvement?     Why   tie     thoiifj hands and   make -them stand Idly    by 'While  unWorthy  men  are .put  In  highly places to rule over them? I'
A violation of the constitution of thiij United States that Is practiced in all! e.tcept four ot the states today is the taxation of the property of women. Read v/hat James Otis-said about tax¬ ation    without    representation:,    &quot;The

to   woman,   man   Is   a poor creature Indeed;  in fact, they In¬ sinuate   he   shines   by   reflected     light [ alone shed on him by mother, wife, sis- \ ter or sweetheart.
But when we turn our attention to the common law and to the statute laws of most of our states, we are forced to the conclusion that man's mental attitude as expressed by these i&lt;ec6rds shows a most decided contrast. By these, women is made a perpetual minor. Her sons at the age of twenty one and the negro born Into slaver.v nnd yet only partly civilized are her political masters, A prominent lawyer of our cltyjputs woman's legal condi¬ tion In this state tersely thus: ¦'The laws of Tennessee, In effect, declare husband and wife are one and that one Ih   the   buabaml^,

For what, civil right is worth rush, after a man's property le suo- ct to be taken from him at pleasure Ithout his consent? If a man is n«V lis Own assessor In person or by dep- Uy, his liberty 1« gone and ho is en- jreiy at the mercy ot others.&quot; And jhls Is true, even In a greater degreo f women, because nf their Impecunl-

' tk* womanly 'woman, when aha htars that her functions In life la Iiard and that the road she must travel Is stony and tiresome, prays In her heart to be shown the way to make It less hard and stony and tiresome for those who come after her.
A womanly woman does not cry for a change In her dutlea but only that' she may learn to understand better exactly what her duties  are and    be:
willing to shoulder the full  responsl blllty of them.
A womanly woman 'knows that while she forgets her duty towards others her duty toward herself Is un¬ performed.
Should Respect SeW First. The womanly woman cannot reach the best within herself 'while  she la- :. bors beneath a sense of Inequality. She jl knows that to have others respect her 1

Virtue that can be bought at this minimum wage will not be virtue of long standing; for eight dollars brings more demand than four or five dollars, and the accessories that complete thef living wage of eight dollars ts liable' and propable to lead to grosser wronsf and greater Immoral practice, than that at a lower wage.
Tlie legislature Is Imposing a very differient taste upon the employe. Many girls entering stores have no standard of right conduct and right living. The fault Is In their home en¬ vironment where virtue sbould be Inculcated aP'd'lmninnted, so deeoly that the van'tleg of Ufa wll noi lead to ruin, for after all. It Is not the low liv¬ ing wage that leads to girls going as¬ tray. It Is the glamor of life, the love of grandeur and luxury, the longing for the delicate accessories and com- foTtw.

With sentiment  growing,  ns  it  is in I this state, (or equal suffrage,   it  is  ao wonder that Tenneesee has been placed in the list ot &quot;probable&quot; equal suffrage i stietes for  1913-14.    At  the convention of  the   Teiines.see  Equal  Suffi'ago  ateo-' ciation, held in Nashville .Tannary ft and 7. the delegates ado()ted as thoir slogan, &quot;Make Tennes.sec tho first southern equal auffragp state,&quot; and the  women of tins state, wilh  th*? courage of thtdr convn;- tions  behind   thctn,   will soon   li«   iu   a position   to   demand   their   entranchise- tiient.
Some National Facts.
The i'H|)id growth ot equal suffrage senlimpnl in Tennessee and tin? soiiUl «ii*ee-181&lt;). i» tmly an ocUo of Uuj wKisie nalloiml nuiveiiienl. There are now ni.ne equal *Hnrage stales iu the I'nioii. They art- Wyoming, Wa«biiigtou, I,'tab, Idaho, Colorado, California. Kanjias, Oregon and Arizona. The three last .states wont for cijual sHffrsKO in the Novenrt).&quot;!-, Il)i2, olcetlons and iu Sliohigan the cau.ic failed by only UOO voIcj. It is cerlain that MJcliigan will be won bv tiic womed in lOlil.
Tho number of women now tntltlud to vote total tbrjc million: .Xcciu'ding to rellaWi* statistics, siity-six per cent ot tiiiise Women will actually exercise tboir BUffrc-pc riglits. At the next general c.k'ction. tberpforo. two niilliou Amertcan women will go to thi» polls as full-fledged cltlxens. This great new political force, hertd by women, is sufficient, it acting in untsou. to turn tlie scale in national issne.s. Tlic whole Pacific coast is tiej .soil for women and they can now claim about one-fittb of the states in tl.i. Union. Tim equal suffrage states cau cast today sevenly  vote* in the electoral  college.
After New York state is won. In 11H5, a iiatiiuiai campaign will be inaugurated, tot o.iual auffrasn is rapidly becoming a question for the nation to decide, instead | of the separate sta'tes. Two-thirds of 1 the stales ^an call a convention to] amend thp national coustitutlon; three- tourtUs arc needed,to adopt nb amcud- meiit. lu that roll call Idaho, for In- stnuiH*, will loom as lareo as I'enn.syl- vania. The eufranchiscment of women will, in lOKi, be a national  issue.
Un November 21. last, delegates from all thf suffrage orgauizatioiis in the country met in convention at Philadel¬ phia. This was the largest iind most signiflcani political gathrriiig of women 1 = ever held iu the ITnited States, u hist ric |5 event. Iiistininilshe&lt;l speakers at \bis convention wero: Baroness Kertli.t. vcn Huttiipr, llie crest advoc^o-te of intern.&quot;.- tioual peace and the Avinuer of the Ni&gt;b:l peace prii'.e in IflO,&quot;); IJarrio Chapman Catt, president of the Internatiou.ii Woman's Suftrage Alliance, who b«s juot returned from a two years' tour of tbe World ou wbich she investigated llie social evil in evfry eouotty on earlli; Dr. Anna 1 Inward Shaw, president ot the National AmwScan Woman Suffrage association; .lane Addams, Harriet SMau- ton Blatch, Mrs, O.

The biennial convention of tha Intot^ national Woman Suftrage alliance ii\iil be held at Budapest, June 15-20, lOKl. IHIi'gates from twpnty-erght co'mtrjcs will attend. The city council of Budapt-Kt has contributed $5,00 toward this conveu- tiou. This will bs the moot iraportant gathering of womeu ever held iu the world.
.\nd so the onward march o^ equal suffrage take its way. The six jbiUiua women brpadw'inners iu tbe. Raited States will not much longerW debited of the prolectiou oif the bi^M niSlf of their Inalienable right to iifcTlHSftfty^^ml the pursuit of happiueiss. -  v.

Dear Sir;—^The press reports you as having delivered an address «t Memphis to the .graduates of the public schools and quotes the two sentences wiiich fol¬ low-— ,  .    ,
&quot;Woman's suffrage tends to destroy the home and w»ith it the sweetaesa of human life.&quot;
&quot;All this business^ ot women pusUiug themselves into the sual avocations followed by men is destrnctive to the homes &quot;
A formal public utterance b.v one oc¬ cupying a high position naturally attracts attention nud is oaiculated to have mucU hiflueui'e.
No greater problems for solution have ever come to auy nation than the two subjects tonchcd uixm liy yen in the sentences quoted above: thnse of t.He suffrage and imlustrialisni.

After twenty years' experience In school work, I can say that our school boards are absolutely non-polltlcal, and party affiliation Is never consid¬ ered In the appointment of teachers. , Whilst our teachers are cltUeus, tak¬ ing part In public affairs, voting and often attending primaries nnd con- vejitlons, I have never heard of a teacher being dismissed or appointed because she was a republican or dem¬ ocrat, nor of a member of a school hoard being elected because he ber loused to this jor that party. Oeneral- ly, both parties are represented on Ihe same board. .Sometimes a board principally democratic Is founo m re¬ publican communities, and vice \ ersa. Our teachers are free to voto accord- liiK to their own consciences.  1  have

In compliance with your request fo» an opinion on chapter 111», 'the &quot;woman suftrage&quot;   aoti   I   beg   to   say:
I heard the discussion, in tha senate. When the bill wasi-read I remarked to the gentleman next to me, Mr, Thomas B. Johnson, that the measure was Un¬ constitutional. &gt; Careful examination of this act conHrms the opinion then expressed.
There are at least two very serious defects In the act—the poll tax and tbe   ballot—and   possibly   a   third.
Poll tax Is a constitutional tax. Im¬ posed to raise revenue for educational purposes. Section 28, article 2, pro¬ vides, &quot;All male citizens of this state over the age of twenty-one years,  ex-

wise furnish evidence of the ftaynient of poll taxes assessed against them, In tbe same manner required by law of   other   voters.&quot;
Actual payment of poll tax does not protect the voter who falls to pro- duco the statutory proof of payment: 1. c., the satisfactory evidence of pay¬ ment required. State vs. Old, II Pick., 723.      ¦ .   ,   '    -   . -.       . ,
Omitting       tit*    words
the provision of sirf-. tion il .iiiBuiio. Women must produws the saWie evidence of payment of poll taxes rb^itjlred oT men as a preroqu*. site'Of voting. ''.
The leglslatdre has no constltutlo««- al authority to assess a poll tax against , women, therefore, the Wor^l'a &quot;assessed against them&quot; are superflu¬ ous. ' .
Should It be Insisted that the lej*-. UlatUre' Ii)tended to confer upon woW' en the right to vote without requ&lt;lfti! ing satisfactory evidence of paymeJU ot poll taxes while such a requUifr ment Is exacted from men then thlK would   be   class   legislation.
The logical conclusion from the 1 guage  employed  In section 3  is:  T women     were   put   (In     the   electt mentioned)   on   the   same   footing men.
No poll tax ts sought to be li posed upon them as upon men. Is could thera be under the conVltifr tion. Therefore, the requirement tbi^t they produce satisfactory evidence pjf its payment as a prerequisite to TOjL-. Ing makes it In effect a privilege tax&gt; This the legislature cannot Imposa an voting Is not an avocation.
It may be further noted that ¦•»• tion 3 refers only to &quot;elections tor electors of President and VIee-Pr«M)i dent of the United States,&quot; and Is An¬ ient as to other elections &quot;tor all Ot- ftoers of cities, towns and taxing dis¬ tricts, and upon all questions or prop¬ ositions submitted exclusively to t&amp;e vote of the electors ot such muntclpalw ties&quot;   set   out   In   section   1.
The ballot presents a no less «erioin difficulty.      Tinder    our    election    ll* names  or  all  candidates  appear npOtk ,1 one   ballot,   and   there  is  no  provlstto made for «. separate box.
The following Illustration 'will ex¬ plain this: Given a precinct where onlt thousand ballots are cast, the clerKI' poll lists showing five hundred men and five hundred women to have voted. Tbe count, however, discloses the fSw that some eight or nine hundred bof- lots have been voted for others than the presidential, electors. Here, tbeii. Is a situation 'where the entire vote of that precinct. In other than the presi¬ dential race, must be thrown out. Thla might result in reversing the real voice of the people. ^
The' legislature has authorized nu¬ merous bond issues to be determined! by local elections. Until the &quot;womail suffrage&quot; act Is passed upo&quot; by thi courts, women voting in these eleoi. tlons may cause the valldll' of the bond Issue to be questioned, and thUs affect the sale  of  the bonds. &lt;
It Is regrettable that this situation has arisen. The public Interest det mands tbat It be settled by our Su» preme Court at the earliest poSslbU date.
The Republican'party, now In contr^' of oongres^, tv-lll pass the Susan tf. Anthoiiy amendment, thereby seeking 'to make political capital for 1920. But as only state Ugislatures that shal} have been elected subsequent to suCh passage can act upon the amendment, some time may yet elapse before It iU&gt;f comes a part of the Federal constltui^ tion. ;
This reply to your Inquiry Is not a court brief, but merely a yery &quot;brt«( opinion.''

Question Attracting Wide At¬ tention and is Being Uni¬ versally Discussed.
WHERE WOMEN CAN VOTE
otes for Women a Success
Opinion of Eminent IVien on
the Subject Proves
Interesting.
(By  Laura  M.  ThornliurBh.)
There  (s  probably  no' question   receiv¬ ing   more    universal    attention    at    tha present   moment   than   the   question   of woman suffrage and  what &quot;that  implies. _  . &quot;^^ Ilka the Plnchot-haiiinse
affair or city elections may assume more importance for a short space of time, out the suffrage question with argu¬ ments pro and con is one that Is likely to continue Indefinitely or until It la satisfactorily settled to those most con- cerood.
One crn hardly plelt iaJ.jt..nfWBpaper or a current magaslne without niitiing some article bearing on the question. Leading and representative statesmen, public ofriclalli, literati and profes¬ sional men have been Interviewed and their opinions printed. It Is an Inter¬ esting fact that most of the opinions publicly expressed are decidedly In fa¬ vor of the movement. Those who have given the mfttter thought seem to real- lK« that equfti suffrage not only will come to those who want It, but Is al¬ ready here, and It Is only a quest^n of time when It will be universal In tliis country.
The question has come to be, &quot;Will •It be best for all concerned that women be Riven the ballot?&quot; for the question, '¦Is It right tbat women have the 'power of the ballot?&quot; has been answered In the affirmative; There ar* no sane ar¬ guments tbat Intelligent women should be discriminated against when the Illiterate nesrro has a right to soy what shall be done In municipal affairs. It also seems absurd to think that a young boy ju^ twenty-one years of age can go out and vote on matters of public welfare when the school teacher who bas taught him all be knows about political economy shall   be   denied   a  voice   In   tbe   matter.
It Is Interesting to read tbe senti¬ ments of public men from the states where women's suffrage is now allowed. Tbe general feeling Is decidedly favor¬ able. Those who object are almost en¬ tirely the party bosses and professional politicians whom the w.omen have de¬ feated.
Women Vote In  Municipal Affairs.
The city government Is now elected by men and women together In every city of 'England. Scotland, Ireland. Aus¬ tralia. 'New Zealand. Norway. Sweden and Denmark. In this country womeh have the rights of equal suffrage In Idaho. Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. . Opinions of   Public  Men.
In speaking on woman's suffrage. United States Renotor Borah, of Idaho, says; &quot;I would he enlbely unwHUng to see woman's suftrage aboUsbed.&quot; United States Senator Heyburnt of Idaho, savs: &quot;The general . tone, of political affairs*In the state have Improved and greater car^ In the selection of candl- datep has resulted.

Jane Addams was ono of the speak¬ ers at a luncheoh recently given In i Washington by the National Collegro j Bi|i:al. .Sujft-a^e league. She said that the women of Illinois had found their Influence much Increased since they got the ballot. Illustrating this. Miss Addams continued:
&quot;MtsR Mary lAcDo-well had been greatly Interestert In the garbage ques¬ tion for many years, because the lilg- gest garbage dump in Chicago is in her ward, and tho garbage haa simply been put there and allowed to decay. She has iiiterviewed all manner of commttteea and officials, without re¬ sult. Within two weeks after the wo- rran suffrage law weht into effect, Mlas McDowell was appointed a member of a garbage committee, made up mostly of aldermen, with one or two physicians—a committee 'with $10,000 to spend. In all likelihood this would not have happened but for wo¬ man suffrage.
&quot;W© had been tr&gt;ing for a long time, without success, to secure the appointment of police-women. We wanted them eapecially to look after girls at dance halls and in other places of public recreation. After wo¬ man suffrage 'was granted ten pollce- TVomeh were appointed very quickly 'With full police powers.
&quot;.ludge Owens, who makes the ar¬ rangements for the city elections, haa issued.aa order a£idn« for 1,4»C ¦wo¬ men volunteer* to serve as judges and clerks of election In every pre¬ cinct. The pay is $5 per day, and tne work will cover about 20 days in the course of a year, including the 'va¬ rious electlohs, and the time needed for counting the ballots. Judge Owens j Is establishing so many precedents that I think the opponents of equal rights will never be able t'o get the wOHjen  out.

A prize was lately won by th© fol-, stitutlon, giving    women a lowing    limerick,    written     by    Mrs. John  B.  Parker,  a member      of    the ESm club  of 'New jOrleans: There once was a woman of note Who  very much wanted to vote; .

AU  this   could   be accomplished,  she  maintained,  at  one stroke,    with not    more    preliminary ] work  than  it would  take  to  get tUo j states   lined   up   by   means   of   publio j opinion in favor of suffrage.

Mrs.  Funk invited  that lady  to express her opinion en the subject.
Mrs. Seton arose and .stated that she differed with Mrs. Funk, ahd..whlle differing she represented a faction .In favor of moulding pulsiic opinion In favor of passing the old Susan B.

It took me just eighteen minute* to g6 from my home to  the  polls,   cast  my vote,  at.-  re¬ turn.&quot;

Decision is Reached Not to Limit Work Before Congress to Ef¬ forts For Passage of Bristow-Mondell   Suffrage   Amend¬ ment to the Odnstitution—Southern Suffragists Decide to Wagd Fight to Add a Sou them State to Suffrage Oohimn Within T-wo Years.
-I
Nashville, Tenn., Nov, 13.—By a vote 01 almost two to one the convention of the National American Woman Suffrago ufcsociutiou here late today decided that its work before congress fpr the eu.lBTbg year shall not be limiied to efTorts for the passage of the Bristow-Mondell suf- frmige niuenilnieiit to the federal con¬ stitution.    At  an earlier session the na-
MrE. M'Cormick Speaks.
Jiliajorily that ii.s congressional co'iimit- lee Hhali not conduct canipaigus osninut Ciintliuatcs in any stnte wltliout the cou- seut ot the Hiiprage assotiatiou in the Stale concerned.
The action fif the-convention on these
'luntleis settled two of tbe most import-
any great effect ujion politics, as their; aui (niesliouH before the pn^cut c&lt;mTeu *&quot;&quot; &quot;     —&lt;¦••¦¦— -        - L ...     (j,^„—ijue^fmi, which have given rise to
much division of opinion a'Utmg the suf- fingists during the last few raouths and whicll had siguiHcaut beariuK' uiion theirr phtus fur next year's campaign.
The debate ou both iasucs was de¬ cidedly spirited and at timeii tinged wilU futioiml   bitteniess.
Tonight's iiiass meeting was hi the bauds of the &quot;voters,&quot; the ^irogrum being under tlie auspices of lite .National -Men's League for Woman Suffrage wifh Jaiiu's l.tCM I.diidiuiv prcKidiiig, and addresses by JSeiiator Luke tea of Teniicsee aud men and wotnen suffragists froui several states.
maie relatives, such as husbands, fathers and brothers, and in some cases sweethearts, would control their sentiments with regard to candidatM and issues, and in that way maintain (the party lines in just about the same, ratio as existed before suffrage wag granted.
That theory, however, failed t&lt;» mUI isfy the mere male, and be has continued' to dwell upon the matter and advance theory after theory until he has built for  himself a  political  bugaboo.
As a matter of fact, the first theory is, with just one exception, correct. Women voters, at least those who have made any study of politics, have in| &quot;a majority of instances adopted the po¬ litical faith of tlieir husbands, fathers or brotber.o, and are as a rule even j more partisan than men. The great majority, bowever. have made abso¬ lutely no study of polities or public | questions and will go to the ballot box

is incorrect is with reference to women candidates.    The  women,  as  ali  men
sirs. Harriet Stanton Blatch. of New Verk. one of the principal, champions Ot
know, are perverse creatures and take one legislative niea«m-c phiu, presented a keen delight in doing the unexf&gt;ected. In the cotniiig elections they are plan¬ ning to do the unexpected is botl^ the. county election and the demtKratic primary. In other words, they have teen thinking for themselves and, al¬ though their methods ot reasoning and their final decisions sound rather in¬ consistent and illogical to mere man, they have decided to do two unexpected things.
One of these is to explode the time- •worn belief that a woman is incapable of grasping politics and will never learn to plan and scheme for the success of tbe candidates she favors. It is also proposed to explode the belief that a tvoman tells everything she knows. The women of Hamilton county, or at least tbe active portion of them, are planning to elect Mrs. Penelope Johnson Allen to the legislature, and are now waging a campaign among women voters in an effort to get them to &quot;single shot&quot; for her. The plan has. been in process of perfection for some weeks and mere man did not learn anything of it until it leaked out yesterday through a non¬ voting woman who had been ap¬ proached and who did, not know that she was giving a political secret away when she told a man about it.
Another surprise the women have in store, nnd one which is absolutely In¬ consistent with the election of &quot;Mrs. Allen, is the defeat of Miss Sadie Wat¬ son, woman candidate for register on the republican ticket. The same group of women who are backing Mrs. Allen for tbe legislature are fighting Miss Watson for the reasoQ that they do not believe a woman has any place in public office.
&quot;But,&quot; suggested a reporter in con¬ versation with a female politician yes¬ terday, &quot;if Miss Watson has no busi¬ ness in politics neither has Mrs. Allen, llow are you toint to reconcile .vour position on th«t&lt;
&quot;My idea of the obj(&gt;ct of this iisso- eiution,&quot; said Mrs. ileoill McfTormick, (,f riiicaeo, chniroian of the &lt;:oiigr&lt;.-»«i&lt;&gt;n«4 coiuuiittee, &quot;is tha, we want to pussHa- tioiial ieglslutiou to give wouicu the bnl- l.il.

<dc:description>H SIDES ^ ARE BOLTERS
Returning Suffragists Tell of Their .Convention.
JUST LIKE REPUBLICANS IN EVANS-BROWN LOW DAYS
Miss   Ervin   Says   Mrs.   French  and
Her Crowd Bolted, and Mrs. Mc-
Cormlck'g Follows Were
the Ouilty One*.
&quot;No anger or ill feeling—simply women standing for their ideals in a dig¬ nified wav,&quot; is the explanation of the re¬ cent division of ranks in the State Equal Snffrage association furiiished by Miss Margaret Ervin, president of the local league.
&quot;When the convention waa called to¬ gether there were things tbat had to be accounted for. The minutes of tha Mtunphis meetings of tj(e executive hoard had.to be threshed out and they knew they would have to face the music, so they bolted,&quot; said Miss Ervin. &quot;Wo are the ones who had the majority, the convention standing 75 for Mrs. McCor¬ mick and 52 for Mrs. French without the officers. They were divided four and four,, making 79 for us and 56 for Mrs. French.
&quot;They tried to put over a filibuster scheme by preventing the report of the credentials committee to come np and we put np with it during the morning Of the opening meeting' and also dur¬ ing the afternoon. Mrs.- French gave ns only fifty minutes to transact the business of the afternoon and when she declared the meeting adjourned In order that we might take an auto ride I ob- : jected. Others also objected and when she Ba\^ the majority was •against her, ¦he stalked out of the room.&quot;
Miss Ervin explained in detail how Mrs. French was late In arriving at the convention hall the day following the \ revolt and how Mrs. McCormick took the chair and presided until the arrival pf the deposed head. She said Mrs. French had a table placed at the other end of-the hall and rapped for order, re¬ questing at the same tiiue that her fol¬ lowers turn their chairs around and face her end of the room. Just One &quot;Mere Man&quot; Mixed Up in the Feminine Squabble.
One member of the body who was a delegate told of the sad experience of Fred Jones, of Chattanooga, who was the only man present. It appears that Mr. Jones was suddenly' pressed Into service when the rival factions startei' to transact business. &quot;He carried chai* from one end of the room to anotln and had an awful time,&quot; she said. * Miw Ervin vigorously denie-j ! Mrs. McConnick's faction, coroprj most-'of the members of the Cual— iiooga Eiqual Suffrage association! a\^ the insurgents. She &amp;toted posiflK'ely thot that side was in the majority,&gt;ui3 therefore belonged to tbe regular ide* luent. Miss Ernestine Noa, who was ii'' delegate from that league, pleaded for hannony on the convention floor and re¬ fused 10 take sides either way, it is said. When fhe   announced   that  she   would

It   is   said   that   the   Equal Rights   league   agreea   to &quot;reorganize   in one body, but the Equal Suffrage associ¬ ation refused. Rival Corps of Offkera Elected at Conve»tion.

¦diior nW Journai: HtSn. William .lennlngs Bryan has truthfully de- ciarea, &quot;tbe forces of evil are bat¬ tling against woman suffrage.&quot;
The opponents of woman suffrage have published broadcast an open let¬ ter   to   that   great   man   calling   on him  to. substantiate his charges.  He '3 too big a man to trouble to prove anything   to   brewers,   distillers   and liquorites generally,  for  the passage of   n.itlonal     constitutional     prohibi¬ tion federal amendment and its rat- floation   by   forty-ei  ht   states   has net   the   leal   of   disapprobation   and condemnation  on  them   forever.   The enforcement  of  the  law  Is  oil   that s required now.   Neither Is It worth his   while   to   attempt   to   prove   to men   In   high  places,   In  church   and in state,  that they are playing Into the  hands  of  evil   men  and  women, vhen  they cast aside all reason and common   sense   at   tbe   prospect   of losing control of tbe  women  people of  this  country  In   tbe  near  future, it  la  well,  however,  for  the  women of   Georgia   to   know   why   the   Em¬ pire  State of  tbe  South  is so  back¬ ward   In  advancing  the   Interests ,of 'he   women,   tbe   other   half   of   oiir '¦ommon humanity and  therefore en- I itled to equal right's with men.    For some  reason   men  fear   women.

Which organization or faction will the national convention recognize is the problem that is besetting the minds of the suffragists nnd the suffragettes—the latter the insurgents. Miss Ervin says it's utterly impossible for the main or¬ ganization not to recognize Mrs. McCor- mick's side, while Mrs. Case is equally sure that Mrs. L. Crozier French will come out tho winner.
Mrs. Case liinted that the wliolc trou¬ ble started over the national convention meeting place, and says that body Is ra- sponsible because they should have des¬ ignated what city should have this honor. Mrs. Case said she favored Nashville because she was afraid Chat¬ tanooga could not creditably handle so large a body of distingiiislied women.

To &quot;spice up&quot; tbe meeting ; I several  freak  bills  were presented,  such a.s   &quot;a   bill   to   regulate    the    length   ot trousers,&quot;   &quot;taxation   of   bachelors&quot;   and &quot;hill,   to   regulate  the   drees  of  women,&quot; 'all  of  which  wee very  amusing.
Mrs. French acted as speaker and show¬ ed niuch ability as a presiding officer, hotli as to the general routine ot legisla¬ tive business and rulings on questions of parliamentary law. The members di¬ vided into two factions, the liberals with Mrs. Bossle O'Brien Hundley as leader and the conservatives, led 'by' Mrs. Myr- telle W.

In opening the. sesision Mrs. French iiijide an Hiifirt.'rS on the status of women in tiie body politlp of all states.

Rep¬ resentative Miller was introduced aa the legislator who secured the vote for the women of Tennessee. He dlsclsiim- cd the honor accorded lUm, saying tha* the bill and everything else was In line shape when presented to him. Senator CJarter s'aid he neVer dreamed he had p]«ased -so many people in helping push the suffrage bill, which showed the pop. ularlty of sulfrage In Tennessee. He de¬ clared that the women by their en¬ trance inta politics had made It Im¬ possible for any more &quot;crooked old pollth'ians&quot;  to fall  In line.
The Tennessee, suffraslsts aro plan¬ ning a strenuous year devoting much time to inltensive org.inization work. A state orgajiizer will be engaged to do educationjl-work In the rural districts.

WHY Wi: GO OJT
Now that the !i;iIlot for Women is so nearly wop, why should not the National Americ-iii 'rt^oman. Suffrage A-socbition prepare to disband? This question is sometimes aakAd. It was \vi ll and clearly .inswered by the Na tional corresponding necretary. Mrs. Shiiler. In a riKcnt address'before the Mas.s;ichusetts Woman Suffrage Asso¬ ciation; -she said, in part;
&quot;It is asked why wa should not Rive up our orc;aiiizatton, instead of changing It into a League of Women voters. •    '-^  . .
&quot;In the first pUice, our work is not done. We h.lve not yet secured the ratillentiOM of the Federal Suffrage amendment by the necessary 36 leg- isUituren -•        _     _
&quot;In the sei'ond place, the machinery of our- organization has enabled us to keep together a band of women who lire couraijeous. unit willing to under- tike Ipgislativc work; We should take hold of the conatruetlve work now needintf to be done. When the kov- ernment had bis work to do during the war, it enlled upon the suffragists, in-I  thev  rrvHle a colossal record.
'Another reason why We »hom* «ST disband our national organiaation is that BO many ot the questions in whi«:h wonien are Interested -^.te. national ques¬ tions, and therefore cniinot he ^ turned over wholly to the state legtelatUrea.
&quot;Again, there must always l)e twme groat for&lt;'n which agitates and edu¬ cates, it the country is to advance: we ought to be it.
&quot;I'lnaily, we ought to maintain our organization because, while we have In our suffrage work some women of great breadth of vUslon. yet the rank and Jlla. of women—and of men. too. for that matter—are uneducated in po¬ litical affairs, and we must 4ducait« both the women and the men.&quot;

DROP  THE JEBICHO  FEATUEE
lUm's Horns Will Not Be IWovnx Dur¬ ing Big Demonstration, Leaders Be¬ lieving Tactics Out of Place In th« Present Crisis—^Union and Wom- Mi'a Party Combine.
Encircling; the White House with a i chain of purple, white and gold, wom- ' en BUffraKlBts will bring to a climax »t I 3 p. m. today In a two-hour silent ; demonstration the|r siege of President \ Wilson on behalf ot a Federal suftrage ' amendment. About a thousand women, ; members of tbe Congressional Mnlofi 'for 'Woman Suffrage and tho National ; ^Women's Party, have  enlisted to length-
¦ en for the final watch tbe lino of plck- \ ets on guard at the White House gates ' for, the last six weeks, encompassing ,' the Proaldent's comings and goings to i Impresi him In the last days ot his ,' first term with thelT determination to I have the ballot.
» Not Exactly Like Jericho.
J Only In a modified form, however, [, will the demonstration follow plans f that had' been laid to reproduce the « march of the Israelites around Jericbo. jJ At first it was proposed to circle tbe u White  House  seven   times,  with   seven
¦ priests carrying tbe siiffraifc ark, and «accompa-nled by &quot;'a long blast of the j ram's born,&quot; the citadel signifying to- ; suffragists tbe stronghold of opposition ': to tbe cause of suffrage by Federal ^'amendment.
I; Why that method of attack was li abandoned has not been made entirely &gt; clear by tha women's lesders, some of (tbem explaining that the critical inter- It national situation would make such a J demonstration appear as bad taotlcs, |i and others binting tbat some of those In the suffrage ranks thought It might seem to border on the sacrlliglous.
Outwardly, at least, the President has ehown no sign of wavering In his oppo¬ sition to a Federal amendment and hia preference for suffrag&quot; by State enact¬ ment.
Won Only WUson's Smiles.
Dally he bas smiled and salutrd at the pickets always encountered, rain or shine, when the presidential car haa left or entered the ¦•'White House grounds.
During the flrst days of tbe siege, when bitter ,Ianuarv winds tried the courage of. the guards, lie sent them an i Invitation to come inside. But It was j not accepted, and since then, except for iJLhe uaily smile and salute, he has not } shdwn that he waa aware of his state ] of siege.
1 Today's demonstration, the most re- j markable perhaps of all those that have • characterized the flgbt for equal suf- j frage. will be timed to begin three i hours after tbe ofUcial beginning of tbe I new pr'isidential term.

I    CONGRESSIONAL
THE
' Brilliant Event.'
The formation of the 'I'cniipssieo bruni'li of tlie'union occurred iiiiiid the mo*,- favorable circiinistunces. When il ' lic- cnine Unown thut Miss .Mice 1*11111, 'lie official heaii of the (Joiigression uiion, was lo come to Tennessee to form nn organization, and when it hocatue fiir- ther-'laibwu that thin orBauizntion wniilil be cfTii'tod in. Knoxville, tbe Politiciil Kqualil.v league, one of the three Inciil sufri&quot;ii;;H&quot; orgnnizations, iiiflde arraiitre iuenis fur n banquet to be given in hmuir (if Miss I'nul, find it was nt this thai Ibe Tennessee branch  was innugurated.
FdllMwing the discussion of tiie monn. Ill's, (i. W. Deiiney, who presided Kraccfiilly iind cfiiirniiugly as toastmis¬ tress, iiiirodueed the speakers.
Ill thi absence of the mayor, John E. McMilliui, who was to have made llie first talk, Mrs. L. ('. French, the veteran siiffrajjisl of East Tennessee, the woman who ll.'l^ fought inanj verbal battles fov the ('iiii,|., was called upon, nnd a^ usual, rose splendidly lo tiie occaainn, Mrs, Freiii'li suid she had long secretly wished to occniiy Ihe riiayor's clmlr, nnd thai this WHS. at Inst, the reiillzatlon of her hopes. .Mrs. French said she had linen in s.viii|iat.liy with the pulicy of the juiioii sinci' iN organization, for the IVdcrnI nnicmliiienl route is the most direct and till' least expensive wiiy to Ihi^ sun'rn«e.
'iilil. William Rule, editor of The •hiiu'iiiil and Tribune, was the second speaker. He wished the union speedy and i'iiiii|il(»ie siici-ess, and said that lie [was willing to go on rword as beiiiK one jiiMit In Knoxville who' was not ufniiil llie nITairs of th^ iiatinn would go ill ih'siriiclion if tlie womeu are giveii the rlKJii of franchiiie.

CONGRESSIONAL UNION STATE .y BRANCH IS ORGANIZED HERE
What It Means.
The forinatiiiii of n Tennessee tiranch of t\*e (&quot;oiiBresMionnl I'nion for woman suffrace whs the object of Miss Paul's visit to the stale. , I'lils makes the twei- tyi.sev*nth state hrnncb of the union formed, and. as .Miss Panl explaiiied iu ber talk, these varions state branches lire being orgnniKed so that they may help the ('ongressiouiil iiniim In It* work at Washiiidton In li.ivlng the federal uniendnient lo the &lt;&quot;on«iitntion enfiiiii- chisiiiK women passed.
As is generally known, llie object if the union is to liriiit; jircMsure t 1 betir ii|ioii congress to puss the Susan B. .Vn- lluiiiy unienilmeiit to the federal eoiisti- lulion. whicll provides lor the Rraiiiin^ ot suffrage lo ihe wonien of the na¬ tion.
TIm? work of the union is conceiitratel at Washington on the soiintors and lep, resentatives, and the policy of the iinini is against sepafate state campaigns. The uiembers of iho linioti believe that the quickest way tn obtain suftrage is thi'iiiigh the &quot;stuie's rinlils&quot; prim ipK-. i 'J'lie main work of the separate slate jUraucheH of the union to work on the son- ators nnd rcpresenlutives of llieir various states who are opposed lo tlio passugt of the federal ainenilnieiit eufiaiicliisiiig women, and to do nil iu their powc to eithel' convert them to the cause or |» defeat tbeoi for rt'-«lectiou  I'l  ilie  ii?xi
Ck&gt;lors of the XJaion.
Tto* banquet hall on the fourth floor of the Imperial hotel was d.eoo- r%t»d for the occaal&lt;&gt;n with flags and atreamers of purple,, white and rold, th© official colors of'the Congresslorial union.
The banqueters 'were seated at ¦mail tablea, and the room was en¬ tirely filled. Hardly another table could have been placed. The assem blage waa a brilliant ono, representa tlve of the culture and an Intelleci of the city.
Among the out-of-town wome present were Mrs. Hugh Lawsonl White, of Johnson City; Mrs. .T. N Houser, ot Mascot, Mra. K. P. Jonea, of Maryviile; Mrs. J. E. Brading, Johnson City; Mlas Brncatine Noa, o Chattanooga, and Mlss Nancy Le' Broady, of Maryviile.
Upon motion of Mrs. French, *f waa decided to send a telogram t«j Senator John K. Shields, at Wiishlngi ton, who is known to oppose th«( passage of the federal aniendmenj enfranchising wom«&gt;n. asking him, ill the name of the 160 persons at th« gathering, to re-conslder his poaitioij on this ttiiestion, and vote for th^ amendment. I
Miss Paul's Address.
The chief talk was made by .Misn Paul, who for practically nn lour told the story of the ri.se nf the Congressional union, of its work uud hopes. If there was anyone present nt tlie close of Miss Paul's talk who did not iiuderstniur the union, how and why it came into being, what it has accomplished in the three years of its existence, nml what it con- lideiitl.v expects to achieve before the pre.sent session of congress conies to a close, it was not the speaker's fault, for she certainly made it all .ns ,plahi as &quot;th* nose on your face,&quot;
Mis.s Paul, has, to a relnarkullle de¬ gree, llie ptiwer of clear, logical speech. She hns trained herself to tiiiiik on her feet, and in her inijiassioneil plea for solidarity among wonjen, for the drop¬ ping ot petty differences, and for the con¬ centration of the suffrage forces upmi the passage of the desired federal amend¬ ment, she stirred end aroused a desir.e for action in evisry woman wrthin the Boiuud of ber voice.
The effei'l of Miss Paul's address upon the audience 'was manifest in a practical and substantial manner at its close by the raising, within a very few minutes. $3fi0 for the work of the union.
The Knoxville Political l:;qiiality leogtie promised $50, the Johnson t'ity KitlTrage league $.&quot;&gt;0. the Knoxville Equal Suffrage lenge $2.&quot;&gt;, and the remainder of the money subscribed was individual contribntions.
About sixty periions present allowed H'Cir names to lie placeil on record lis members ot the Tennessee braiH.-h of the
Coagrewional union.   , ,,j,

Organization of the- National Wonman's Party—When tho Na¬ tional Woman's party, then called the Congressional Union, was or¬ ganized In 1913 to concentrate on a campaign for federal amend¬ ment, no action-or even debate on the federal amendment had taken place Incongress since 1887. Poli¬ ticians were opposed and political party platforms silent about the amendment.
Within seven years every po¬ litical party had. Included In 4ts platform an equal suffrage plank. President Wilson had publlply ap¬ pealed for the passage of the amendment  as  &quot;a  vitally  neces

Kansas, the flrst full suffragfc state to act, set a new record on June H. The members of Its legislature, at their own sug- ' gestion, paid their expenses and met without salary in a special session. Now York was the sec¬ ond state to meet especially for this puriKise, and then I'exas, desiring to be the flrst southern stato to act, met In special Bet- slon on June 23.
The half mark waa passed by the ratification on November 1 of California,
The moat difficult campaigns occurred In tba last few states, particularly In New Jersey, West Virginia and Delaware. The op¬ position resorted to every jiossl- ble device to defeat ratification or to substitute a referendum.

QtTEaSTIONS  TH.4T  INTEREST  WO¬ MEN VOTERS.
'^Sister Is Primping (or the Ballot- Box Party.&quot;
This title, in big'letters, runs across a whole page of the Boston Sunday Globe, devoted to a symposium of the question whether women wih.make good as voters.
¦ Helen McDaniel of the National Civic Federation urges women to be open- minded, and ipredlcts that In matters of social welfare they will renounce par¬ tisanship. A leading anti declares that women as voters have dolefully failed to sary war measure,&quot; the amend- 1 make good, ment had hee-n passed by both Preaident Woolley of Mt. Holyok* Col- houses of congress and ratified lege says: &quot;The majority of women &quot;will by thlrty-sIx'states, while po- doubtless enroll in the established par- &quot;••»- —-•' ties. The party which shows .the most progressive attitude with regard to In¬ ternational policy, and questions of social and political welfare at home, will att^'act the woman wbo has a social conscience atid thinks for hei^elf.
&quot;If the old 'established parties be¬ come reactionary this type of woman will ally hcrse'lf with the new party certain to arise under these circum¬ stances, a party composed of men and women. There is little likeHhood, of a 'Woman's Party,&quot; tho cleavage will be not along sex lines, t)ut between fhe men and women who look fot«ward and the men and women who look backward In their thinking and acting.&quot;
Mra. Ellzatreth Tilton, state chairman of the National Physical Education Ser¬ vice, urgea women to make good by working for better health conditions, es¬ pecially among children, to counteract the decline of national health due to modern Induatrlallsm. Sho says. In part:
&quot;The International Tied Cross has called for a great child conservation movement through the world.
&quot;In   Milwaukee   the   Red   Cross   haa placed scales In  every achocri, that all children  may  be weighed  and measur¬ ed,   and   those  discovered   to  be  under par weeded  out  and  given,  under  the supervision   of  the school  doctor    and nvrse,  tho •orrective treatment a«c«*. •ary,    iuiowjng   mat   So   mucU    works back to under-nourisbment and to    the popular   fallacy  that  milk   is  a rtrlnk, not a food,  the  Red Croaa Is running milk wagoua tn the schools at recess, and to the playgrounds.

The National Woman's party from the beginning adopted the policy of holdlnp the party in power responsible for the fate of the amendment and brought pres¬ sure on that party through the &quot;political power already in the hands of the western women.'
Most spectacular of the demon¬ strations was the picketing of the White Houie, which began in January, 1917, and lasted until November, 1917. -During the picketing between 400 and 5Q0 w.omen were arfested for the crime of reminding the President of his responsibility for their en¬ franchisement and sentenced to prison terms ranging from three days to seven months. These ar¬ rests were later declared by the District Courtof Appeals to have been  Illegal.
In 1918, January 10—Two weeks after the last pickets were re¬ leased from jail, and o'lo year from the day the first pick-it line went out, the federal amendment passed the lower house of con¬ gress.
In 1919, June 4—The senate passed the amendment with tw» votes to spare. The house ha* repassed it on May 21, 1919.
In 1919-1920—Special sessions of twenty-nine legislatures ha** to be oalled to secure the neces¬ sary thIrty-sIx ratifications. In all but five of the thirty-rix states campaigns upon either the gove»«- nor or the legislatures were nen- essary.

Georgiii's legislature refused to rati¬ fy the federal suffriige amendmentr—the first legislature to itake adverse action. A democratic legislature and a south- ern one. First state In the Union to reject tho amendment. That 'was on July   24.
Isovi' it appears, from Incontroverti¬ ble evidence, up in the offices of the N. A. W. S. A. that there Is tbe liveliest sort of challenge of the legislature's ac¬ tion .&quot;IS not representative of Georgia sentiment and spirit. Tho challenge comes from the Very heart of Georgia, the pross of the state.
lit Is not alone such papers as that staunch champion of democracy, Mr. Clark Howell's Atlanta Constitution (democratic) which is. filling Up Us front pages wlt\ records of the suftrage movement and Its editorial jiages wath Impassioned rhetoric for Justice to sou¬ thern women, but papers small and great from towns all over the stato as well—papers whieh are stralghit party organs at that.
&quot;Why U It that the ertate of Geor¬ gia should forever and always be last In the procession of progress?&quot; asks the Savannah Press (democratic), and Ith© Columbus Ledger (democratic) takes up the qeustlon and repeats It &quot;The L«dger is surprised at the action of the Georgia Legislature&quot; in Us action on the woman suffrage amendment— it add more mildly Ithan the Savannah Press, which indagnantly wants to know, &quot;Why should the state of Geor¬ gia advertise to the world that we are a backward and a slow-minded peo¬ ple? The majority of the legislature is opposed to suftrage. Of cours» w» cjan't blame them for that. Tho fault Is not theirs that their Intellects ar© IbnSted or their consciences dwarfed. We, the, people, have elected them. Wo are to || blamo, not they. No rational peroon hopes to defeat the amendment. Ail;] that can possibly bo done Is Ito write dowu (leorgia as one of the few, if not the only state, that opposes right and Justice  with  her  own  feeble  bulk,&quot;
It sounds as If Georgia newspaper folk aro more than a Uttio asluimed of thlr ropresentatlvs. It also, sounds at' if some of thoso politicians may have l&gt;eyen &quot;monkeying with- a buzz saw&quot; lis far aa re-election prospects go Continuing over the state one roeeln&lt; niore of the same sor* of shame faced

And the Marietta Journal (demociatic adds in Urue southern style: &quot;It looks like some of our legislatures are trying to get another political 'bhick-eye' for Georgia by the way they are acting on the suffrage question.&quot;
&quot;We have triea to reason out the at¬ titude of the politicians in this state who continue Ito keep up tbe flght against woman suftrage.

In The Interest Of Votes For Women

May Cast Ballots in Municipal and Presidential Election!  ^ .„„^„^, Without Payment of Poll Tax, Supreme Court Rule^ attacked the in 4 to 1 Decision Declaring Act Constitutional—Sep arate Boxes Not Compulsory.        X- ;3 -y ^ / qt ¦
(By Wm. H. Swlggart, Jr.)
Naahville. Tenn., July 26.—The women have won their right In Tennessee for equal suffrage with men In all elections for President and Vice-President of the United States, and for all officers of cities and towna throughout the state. The supremo court today overruled all objections to the statuta of 1919 grant¬ ing women the right to vote In such elections In Tenneasce, and declared the now law valid and constitutional, over¬ ruling ChanooUor James B. Newman, of NaahviUe, who recently held the act un consUtutlonal.
Women may vote without payment of poll taxes until further legislative en¬ actment, the supreme court held.
While the law does not compel sepa¬ rate ballot bores for women, the su¬ preme court advised that separate boxes . be provided in elections where some of .the candidates arertinnlng for offices , for which women aro not permitted by j law to vote.
I    The statute which was upheld by the ' court   provides   that   &quot;all   women,   citi¬ zens of the United States and above tho fage of twenty-one years, having resided ' In  tlie state for one year and  in the county for six   months    preceding any election  therein,  and  who. shall  be an I Inhabitant of the election district or pre- ! cinct In which they offer to vote, shall ,be entitled and allowed to vote at such elections for electors of President and , Vice-President of the United States, and 1 for all officers of cities, towns and tajc- \ Ing districts, and upon all questions or propositions submitted exclusively to a (vote of the electors of such munlcipal- 'Itlas.&quot;
The constitutionality of the law waa attacked In a suit brought by John  J. Vertreea  and  other   prominent   citizens of Nashville,  In  which  It was claimed that since women were given tbe right to vote without the payment of poll tax, I It 'was an unjust and unreasonable dis¬ crimination   against   men   who  are   re- (Ji&gt;i*«d' to exhibit a poll-tax  receipt be¬ fore they can vote.    It was also claimed that the statute could not be put Into effect without destroying the purity and fairness of all  elections because  it did not provide  for a separate ballot-box for ^e women In elections for officers in- i^ding some for whom the women could ¦¦inVOte, so that there would be no way ^uscertain which ballots were cast by omen and which  were cast by  men, j^ no &quot;*ay to determine whetlier the •^^irnen had voted for ofTicens for whom ^ we«e not entitled to vote.

Governor Urged to Include RaU- fication in Extra Session; Opinion Given..'^,..
Special To Tne Knoxville Sentivel. WASHINGTON, June 21.--Tenn- easee may save the suffrage situation. A provision in the constitution of this presidential suffrage state, 'ivhich requires that a legislature must be elected on the question at issue In a constitutional amendment before it can vote on ratification has been held up to this time to prevent that state from ratifying before 1920 elections. The decision by the supreme court in the Ohio referendum case Is now however, according to a statement is¬ sued by the National Woman's party held by the best legal authority to invalidate that state constifutional- provisipn—a similar provision also , exist in the constitution ot Florida. Every effort will be made by the National Woman's party to induce Governor Roberts of Tennessee to respond favorably to the resolution receiitly passed by the state demo¬ cratic convention urging him to call a special session to provide the ma¬ chinery for women to exercise the presidential suffrage accorded them I under the state law In the coming elections and  to  Include in  his call

&quot;The objections to this act have been presented with all the learning and foi-co possible. These arguments harmonize with what were pre-conceived notions of| many of tbe profession. , When the mat ter is probed, however, nothing Is to hel found In the premises, except In the ono| particular noted.&quot;

The &quot;one particular&quot; In which the statute in'ss declared to be Ineffective consisLs of elections held for the pur¬ pose of determining whether &quot;the credit of an.v cotinty, city or town shall be given or 1&lt; aned to or In aid of any person, comoony, aasoclatkm or corpora¬ tion.&quot; In • uoh elections it was held that the constitution confines the right to vote to male voters.
As a result of the opinion of the su¬ preme court, women wlUhave the right to vote In municipal elections, afSfl for Prcdident and Vice-President , without paying poll-tax; but the court holds that the legislature haa the power to levy a poll tax against women, and whether the tax will be levied will be a question for the next legislature, as it is not prob¬ able a special session will be called for | &gt;ic that purpose.
The opinion upholds the right of elec¬ tion officers to provide separate ballot- boxes for women voters, but It Is held that • separate ballots need not be pro¬ vided for the women. On Ibis question, the opinion concludes as follow: &quot;'Wo accept as correct the opinion of the leg- lislature expreased as indicated, (by tha reflolutlon adopted when the statute was passed) that the election officers have tho power to provide Roparate bal- lot-box#s. and we take It aa a matter of course thot the    election    officers will

A letter was sent to him by Miss Sue White, Tennessee chairman of the Woman's Party, forinally mak¬ ing a request for an immediate spe¬ cial session.
Mlss White, who has been In con¬ sultation with the solicitor general of the United States and other legal authorities stated a tthe headquarters of the Woman's Party today:
&quot;I dTscussed this matter with Solicitor General of the United States, wi L. Frlferson, a member of the Tennessee bar and one of the foremost lawyers of the country. His official position deters him from giving a written opnlon, and I have not the authority to quote any opinion he may have ejcpressed pri¬ vately, further than to say that from my- construction of all that he said,^ I am quite sure he has considered the question quite carefully and if In position to express an opinion for publication it would be to the effect that ratification by the present Tennessee legislature would be legal and proper under the principles laid down by the supreme court of the United States in the Ohio case.&quot;
Senator Walsh, of .Slpntana in a letter to Miss White dated June IS, said:
&quot;The question you propound. .. .is a most Interesting one, the proper so¬ lution of 'Which is not simple. I am impressed, hewever, with the view that it follows logically from the de¬ cision of Hawke vs. amlth by the supreme court of the United Sutes, popularly known as the Ohio case, that the attempted restriction in the Tennessee constitution on tht au¬ thority of the legislature in that re¬ spect  in  Ineffective and   inoperative

Votes for'women? Certain¬ ly.
Suffragists? Certainly again, and also yes, Indeed!
KnoxviUe can boast of at least one woman who admits thp,t she Is a suffragist and admits It in such a way that there can be no doubt of her pride In the fact. This woman Is Mrs. Ll. Crozier F/eUch, who has taken such a promi¬ nent part In women's activ¬ ities In getting the ballot in this state and Indeed In the nation wide fight for suffrage.
Mrs. French even claims herself a suffragist by pro¬ fession and her friends have known for some time that she was a suffragist at least by avocation as her work In this cause has been characterized by untiring enthusiasm and sound faith in the ulKmate outcome.
When registering, which Mrs. French made one of her early mornltig duties on this very significant registration day for Tennessee's worpen voters, she was asked her avocation. Some of the wo¬ men who had registered be¬ fore Mrs. French, and j.^ome who have registered since have hesitated at that ques¬ tion. Not ,so with this pioneer leader in the women's rights movement. She took an add¬ ed grip on her pen, smiled with a determined curve to her lips, anti wrote &quot;SUF¬ FRAGIST.&quot;
the opinion of
 ,    secretary    of  tho
Knox county election commission, Mr. Warters states he believes that the women can vote regardless of poll tax by virtue of the fact that they were not qualified to vote whin the ruling was made that no one could vote who had not a poll tax re¬ ceipt dated thirty days before the election or August B.     . ' -
Supplements!   Reflistration ,    Women however,    w*o    have    not ' registered will be required to register in    the    supplemental      registration which will be held twenty days before the electiion of November 2, states Mr. ( Warters.
! Since the amendment has been rat- ified Mr. Warters states he believes
i the registration of women will be heavy this fall,  because of the  fact
(that their eJlglbUity to vttte In ^viH3C
:&gt;«l*&lt;!tlo»r wfli command tbe -Ixitetr^ Of women tairoughout the state. Ttid great tax question is of great Interest to every 'woman who.owns property, •It Is stated, and for the first tlmo women will be allowed to vote lii the state elections where tax meas¬ ures  are  determined.
Strengthens Democratic Ticket Democratic leaders In the city who have   been   hoard   to   express   them¬ selves have  stated  that the enfran¬ chisement of women for participation In every election, will rebound to the strength  of the democratic ticket in .j' the state and will add measurably to ' the prospects of the democratic nat-
: lional ticket from the fact that rati¬ fication by a democratic state and through democratic    Influences    will
¦ make it possible for women through¬ out the country to vote unfettered In
, the November elections. . Tho ratifl-
.cation by Tennessee confers universal
I suffrage upon   twelve  states  of  the
' Union, somi. of which had refused to ratify the federal amendment. .»Republicans   In   Knoxville   too   see
I advantage for tholr party in tl.-&gt;. aC-
¦ tion of. the state.
3 It will be argued, say leaders, that without tho aid ,bf republicans the amendment could not have been rat¬ ified, and that Senator Harding ex¬ erted his Influence to get the le«- -i islature to act favorably, limiting his
; advice only by the consUtuUon of the state.

&quot;There   Is,   In   my   mind,   scarcely any limit to which one must not go logically  with   respect   to  conditions and      restrictions    which    may    be 1! thrown about the act ot ratification by   the   legislature   through   consti¬ tutional provisions, if we admit the . validity of the specific restriction ap-1 pearlng   in   the  Tennessee  Conatitu¬ tion.&quot;
Joseph W. Folk, also in a letter to Mlss White, expressed a similar opinion. He said in part: &quot;The supreme court of the United States held that the federal constitution ^ provides the method for its amend- \\ ment, one of the methods being by the ratification of the legislatures of three-fourths of the slates. The court held that this authority of the federal constitution can not be limit¬ ed or restricted in any way by pro- vlsons of the state constitutions	
&quot;The provision of the Tennessee constitution in question is clearly an attempt to require that all propdsals for the amendment of the federal constitution shall be eubmtted to a vote of the people of the state as a condition precedent to ratification by the legislature of that state. This is what the supreme court of the United States has held could not legally be done. Therefore, in ray opinion, ratification by a special session of the   legislature,   duly   called   by   the i,, , --
governor,  by    proclamation    includ- K| legislature to act ing  this  subject,  would  answer  the requirements  of  the  federal  consti¬ tution  and   be  a   legal   and   binding \ ratification of the nineteenth attend li ment.'^
. Provision   of   Constitution
No convention or general assembly of this state shall act upon any am¬ endment of the constitution of tho United States proposed by congress to the several stat.es, unless such convention or general assembly shall have been elected after such amend¬ ment is submitted.
Miss Sue S. White, Tennessee state chairman. National Woman's Partj' writes to Governor Roberts of Tennessee, aa follows:
&quot;Since the decision of the supreme court of the United tSates on June Ist in the case of Hawke vs. Smith, I have consulted a number of law¬ yers, including Uie solicitor general of the United States, in regard to the effect that the decision may have upon the provision of the Tenilessee constitution which attempts to re¬ strict the power of the general as¬ sembly to act upon amendments of
the  federal  constitution ..Acting
upon these legal opinions, I. am. as chalrmaji Of the Tennessee branch of the Jjational Woman's Party, sub- Biittfhg to yoi^ this formal request thaf^ou call the general assembly of Tennessee into extrabrdfhary ses¬ sion for trie purpose of ratifying the nineteentli amendment to the United States consitutlon.
&quot;This request is made with a full appreciation of every doubt that could possibly arise as to the validity of ratification by the present Tenn¬ essee general assembly, and after due consideration of the contingenciea. that might result should the doubt he resolved against the power of the In support of th«|' J request I am sending copies of opia^ los by Senator Walsh nnd Governor&quot; Folk.

i( win  participate  in   the   election'.   Some  the proper time, believe that unless there 'Is some great Issue In the election, which seems Im¬ probable, there will not be a large wom¬ an vote. I    One well  known   politician said  Sun-
f J day that he did not expect more than
i^f 1000 women to take part in either the
I primary or ejection.
On the other hand many of the suf
Commissioner James G. Crumbliss and Sam K. HIU have als« been men¬ tioned In connection with the mayor's race, although neither has deflnitely made known   his  Intention.
CommlHloner' Crumbliss says that he &quot;expects to be a candidate.&quot; but It la understood that he has not yet de¬ termined whether he wtH enter, the lists

I Istered In Chattanooga In one day last

j Greater Chattanooga election which will
be  held early  In  May.
..They contend that If such great In-

the only question Is the annexation  of
territory to the city that In a Knoxville
city election,  when there will probably
bo 40 or 60 candidates for mayor and
oommlasioners,  tne vote will he much
heavier.
Effect In Donbt.
There is also a great deal of doubt and difference of opinion among poli¬ ticians and candidates, as well as their friends, regarding the effect of the wo- knan vote In the Knoxville election. Some express the opinion that the re-' suit will in all prohablllty be the same as Jf ony men voted.
&quot;Unless there is some unusual oaase :&amp;ir difference of opinion the men and woin«9 of a fatiUlr wUI vote together,&quot; declared one leader Sunday. &quot;I .believe they will. In most instances, get togeth¬ er, discuss the 'various candidates and their quallflicatlons and then vote aa a unit for those agreed upon. However, there will be many Individual excep¬ tions tb this rule, and In expressing this opinion. I,do not mean that the hus¬ band and te.ther will control the wife's : and daughter's vote, but that they will consider the matter around the fireside and reach some conclusion as to their Intentions. Better conditions 'Will proba¬ bly result from thla.'-
Thla view Is not shared by others, however. Somo contend that the women as a whole will be independent voters and that It Is Impossible to foresee the result of their participation In the nr.i. nlclpai election this fall.
..Quallflcatlons tor Office.
Probably the widest difference of opin¬ ion regarding the law Is as to whether or not women may become candldatos
' for mayor and commissioner under Its
'¦ provisions.
Knoxville attorneys are at variance
I on this question, although few have as yet read the act.
Some declare that the right to vote carries with It the right to hold office, while others contend that since the suf¬ frage act limits the right to vote and withholds full oitlzertship It does not grant the prlvlleger of holding office, mu¬ nicipal or otherwise,.^

Former Mayor S. G. Helskell has also been re|jeatedly mentioned as a pos¬ sible candidate for mayor, but so far as known has not intimated any In¬ tention  to run.
Another possible. If not a pixibablo, candidate for ma.vnr la E. W. Noal, bust-, ness man and chairman of the Knox cotinty republican executive committee.
Col. Cary F. Spence, commander of the fainous 117th Infantry throughout tlm world iv«r:&quot;knd. who ran a strong race four years Sgo, has aJso been boost¬ ed for mayor by his friends.

rty of her choice.&quot; In explaining their position that 6 league should not endorse, as a (ly, specific candidates, those ot Ih opinion also quote this para- aph taken from the same document previously quoted: It (The League of Women &quot;Voters) structs women In all the machln- y of elections, but does , not tell cm for whom to vote,&quot; Mrs, Wm, L. Morris, president of league. Is one of those who take view that the purpose of tha lague Is educational and that it does jot favor a 'woman's party. Mra. French, and a number of sup- orters, take a different view of the urpose of the league. They believe hat the League of Women Voters hlch was orgranlzed to take the lace of  the  old  suffrage  party,   Is,
while, not strictly a woman's party, yet an organization, not only for edu¬ cating women in citlsenshlp, but for placing women In office in national, state and local government, where their viewpoint and influence will accomplish much for their country, state Or community.   »
Point to  Preamble
In support of this theory, its ad¬ herents bring forward this statement contained In the outline of the policy of the National League of Women Voters, which follows the statement above quoted, that tho league Is not a woman's party:
&quot;It Is an organlzatlrjn of women working for women—not because wo¬ men have a separate stake in govern¬ ment, but because their simultaneous enfranchisement has made them a grotfp with a collective need for edu¬ cation and experience; and because they can bring a, characteristic wom¬ an's' viewpoint to the solution of the nation's problems.&quot;
Also from the report of the third annual convention of the Tennessee League of Women Voters,' held in Nashville, last January, in a state¬ ment of tho beliefs and purposes of the league, following the endorsement of the state and national by laws, those who beileve the league should support women for office, quote the following: '
Women for Office
&quot;The league believes that qualified women In administrative office, upon boards and commissions and legisla¬ tive bodies, will contribute a neces¬ sary point of view to tho government In the United States, and to its In¬ ternational relations. The league, therefore, urges the election and ap¬ pointment of qualified women in po¬ sitions in natioiiai, state and local government.&quot; ^ .^
'fhe controversy between the stirl- porters of the two conflicting views, with reference to the purpose of the League of Woman, Voters, will most likely be a spirited one and will prob¬ ably occupy the greater part of the time devoted to business.
Following the business iiieetlng, an address by Manager E. N. Farris, of the Board of Commerce on &quot;What a Real Public Health Department Should Be,&quot; and. a. ta:ik by Miss Louise Bignall of the Associated Charities, on the mothers' pension bin wfll be heard by -the members of the league. The program for Thurs¬ day was arranged by tho civics de¬ partment, of which Miss Jean Craw¬ ford  is chairman.
Come On, Tennessee!
Pereival t'leiiiPiil, Kovernof of Veraiont, vefusi^s to call a spc'ial ses,sioii of thf LegislHtiue to eousider the woinau suffrage uincndnipnt. The governor «&gt;f Connecticut is equally obstinate.^ Ixiuisiana and Delaware have locked the door against the women. Ndi'th i'arolina diM's not answer the door-bell. Suffragists now nun to Tenneiwee to break the deadlock and complete ratitication.
If Tennessee fails, it probably means that the amendment can¬ not be ratified in time for all women to vote for president.
indications are that Tennessee will not fail. (Governor Roberts bas promised to comply with IMi^sident Wilson's request for a special sntfrage session of the Legislature. Candidate Cox as.sures tiie National Wtmian's party tliat he will do all in liis power to lii'ing about ratification by Tennessee.
The state constitution of Tennessee says that an election must intervene between congressional approval of an amendment aud j-atifving action by tbe state Legislature. This is to let voters pass on the amendment at the polls. But this obstruction ap¬ parently was swept aside by tiie recent ruling of the Tnited St»ite» Suureme (,'ox}v1 in the Oliio prohibi^tion^m^e. that state laws&quot;&quot;are'*^valid when they conflict with the amendment' ma- diinery provided by the national c'onstitution.
Suffragists have polled ibe 132 members of tiie Tennessee Legislature and have lined up 45 pledged votes for suffrage. Only 22 more votes are needed to win the long fight. Whether millions of wome -. will vote for pr.'sident this year'uow re.sts in Hie hands of 22 men. For those 22 to block suffrage would be rank political folly. It would be ridiculous defiance ol a great national sentiment that hm swept the country.  '</dc:description>

  Mrs.' Thomas Peacock Millor, ^ chairman of the Non-Partlaan pollt- 4&gt; 4cal  league,   has  called  a meeting
# ot all ward uharinnen and mem- ^ bers of the league to take place at
Board of Commerce rooms Thurs¬ day afternoon at 4 o'clock. PlanB for the supplemental registration win fee discussed. They win also explain In detail &quot;how to vete.&quot; A full attendence Is requested.
**^**************
&quot;I^t'iB all pull together, for many things will come up Jn the next two years and we will all want a v6ice in it,&quot; tm.y*i M'S. Thomas Peacock Miner, (¦h,-»Irman  of  the  Non-Partisan   league
&quot;Thursday, iFrlday and Saturday are the days set aside for the auppleniental I'eglatration and I do hope KnoxviUe women will go way ovor the top and ifialu^ at the v«ry least an 8/000 regla- iiation,&quot; Mra. Miller says.
&quot;Many women who tmve bepu out of the dty have ptioned tae regarding this ttflmttmUou. In the supplemental reg¬ istration one canjiot vote In the prl- ;nary bpt ono can vota in tho general «»ct|on and I want an tbe women who were undecided and all the women whose tnisbands' obJ««^ed to them reg¬ istering to put on their thinking caps
\
and thoir permiaalTs caps and taks ad¬ vantage of th»Ir opportunity to register in this supplemental registration. Think of the power and the opportunity of ithe 6,831 wbo hare prepaired to oxer-, olfls their trancMael Paraosally I reaUy dp not soe how anybody «aii hang back. U seems to mo all tho women would really have tha interest of their town ao In mind and In heart that they would teet compelled to ralas tbelr voices for tha advancement of tha prkiciples for which women stand.
&quot;Liet's all pull together—tor many ithtngfl will «ome up in tbe next t'Ao years—and we will an want'a voice in ¦K. It'a your city and It's mine—and now thalt tha legislature and the su¬ preme court have put this responsibil- Itiy upon us whether we ever craved the lespontffblUty or not, it &lt;is here, and It has given the women a, wonderful power and we want to use it wisely and well. I have spoken before of the ex- oellent work of the ward chairmen in the splendid regictr.»tion ot women in Knoxville.
'There are two other groups to whom a great deal of credit of the registra¬ tion if largely du*. Tbe &lt; nut-ses of Knoxville and the central federation of labor. The nurses, many of whom be¬ long to the Non-Parti»an league, have been so busy with their profession that it was imposAihle for them to attend mpetjngs but have been so wonderful¬ ly enthusiastic that in the homes where tiiey were nursing they have been able. to convert many, many women .and real.' ly make them see their responsibilHy. It is surprising how many wom?n have been aibie tn see the light through !the eyes of the trained nurses of Knox¬ ville.
•'The Central tialjor Un|on ple'^ged Iti&quot; support to tbo NonP^t|gan league in promising to do all It o^d to se« that ithe wives, otothers, tttttre, daughters and sweethearts reglatiirecl. It has kept Its pledges, for many 5ntere»ling tales ai'e told hy the men In urging reluctant women to register. Tho «|#&gt;msn in the families of labor have meaiared up ex¬ ceedingly well and we feel It Is dup to Ihe men.
&quot;Ju€rt let me repeat, let's all pull to¬ gether for an 8,000 registration for. Knoxvilte women. We can do it Thurs¬ day, Friday and Saturday oC this week. It'e an easy thing to do and in the coming two years let no wom^an say, 'Oh, I wish I had registered. I oan't vote or do a thing about this, that or the other.' .IjBt there be no regrets. Do your civic duty snd regl«t« without fail.&quot;
tiection Commission Selects Registrars at Meeting Next ^ Wednesday
The selection of registrars to serve In the general KnoSr county registra¬ tion, which is to be conducted from Aug. 10 to 21, is to be taken up by the Knox county election commission it a meeting to be held next Wednesday. The commission will have to provide Jor the registration of the women as well as for the men, and it is estl- inalfed by Roy A. Beeler, chairman of th« committee, that from 5,000 to 7,500 women may register.
The same books will be used for both women and men, Mr. Beeler states.
It Is expected that about 15,000 men will register, Mr. Beeler asserts. About 10,000 or 12,000 of these are men residing within the twenty-six wards of Greater Knoxville.
While the women 'will be allowed to.vote only In city and presidential elections, they will be asked to regis¬ ter in the cc^hty precincts, as this l3 a general registration, and will serve for the next presidential election, which will be held In 1920.
The election commission, which Is composed of Mr. Beeler, as chairman, W. L. Warters, secretary, and C. C.

WOMEN MUStGItE EXACT AGE /,' r   IJN REGISmRlNG IN COUNTY
Commission Will Sustain Regfe trars In Demand That All Seek¬ ing to Qualify as Voters*ive Exact Age—Members of Various Boards Being Sworn In Today With Few Changes in Personnel:
fr&quot;&quot;.:&quot;'M.,
Mlrablle dictu!
The Knox county election commisr Slon today ruled that women muST tell their exact ag© to qualify them¬ selves to register In the general bi¬ ennial registration which will begin Monday morning in Knoxville and Knox ebunty «tra will continue through August    18.
Roy H. Bef ler, chairman of the election commission, stated this morning that ho will sustain any ajid all registrars, who require of each and every woman as a quallflcatl&lt;&amp; to register that she reveal her exact ag in answering the question as to age contained in-the list of questiortr necessary to qualify registrants.
Hal H. Clements, secretary of thn board, stated that he also will vote to sustain all registrars who require women registrants to tell their ages. Just.the mere statement that they aro over twenty-one years of age will not suffice,&quot; Mr. Clepients said. &quot;The women now have got into politics and they must be rpconoiled to com¬ plying with all of the requltBirettts,&quot; Mr. Clements said. 1 To Sustain Registrnrsi
r Captain Mitchett'X.ong, thh'4( mlft~: ber of the election board, stated that he would vote with the other mem¬ bers of the election commission to sustain registrars in this matter. So thati makes the board unanimous.
The question of requiring women to tell the.lr ages as a pre-rtequlsite to registering arose this niorning when one of the registrars who had been sworn in took Captain Long aside and questioned him about as follows: &quot;What are we golftg to' do about these women refusing to tell their ages?&quot; Captain Long told the registrar that he would sustain him in compelling such women to tell their ages. The question seemed to be settled when all of the members of the commission fell in line.
Registrars in the past have report¬ ed to the ._,elefctIon commission that many women would not tell their ages further than to say they were over twepty-one years old, and many were allowed to register with this limited  Information.
The election commfaslon was busy this morning swearing in registrars from over the city and county. The following  oath  was administered  to
ach.
I John Doe, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully and im¬ partially keep the register ot voters In my district, (or^ward) that 1 will not knowingly register or allow to be registered, any person not a legal, ly qualified voter, and that I will not knowingly prevent any from register¬ ing who is a legally qrfallfted voter, so help  me God..
&quot;Signed.    &quot;
Registration books In the city ahd county precincts will be opened each monlng at 8 o'clock and will close at 9 o'clock. It was stated this morn¬ ing that no on^ will be permitted to act as a registrar who has not been -duly sworn, but while sworn 'registrars are supposed to stay with their books, they may have clerks to do the writing for them, if this will facilitate registration. But no neglect on the part of the registrars will be tolerated, and they,.teeing under oath will be held respouslble for any work or action of a clerk or substitute.

idcst Woman Register^ Says Ut  b'^'Religious   iMy^f^   AU Women to Register and to Vote''
&quot;I firmly believe that it is the re¬ ligious duty of every decent woman of KnoxviUe to register and voto In the coming elections now that the 'women have actually obtained the right of suffrage,&quot; said Mrs. Emma Doyle, 812 Second street, the oldest woman who 'has registered In KnoxviUe so far, for the coming nmnlcipal election, whsh interviewed by a reporter for The Sentinel. Mrs. Doylo is 8S years old, and will soon celebrate her 84th birthday. She registered last Thurs¬ day, in the twenty-sixth ward.
&quot;When the question of woman suf¬ frage first came up I was opposed til it,&quot; continued Mrs. Doyle, '&quot;and I stlU maintain the view that U would have been a far better thing for tho coun¬ try if the women had not received the -vote. But, now that the women have that right, those of the low and vi¬ cious classes aro going .to register and vote without exception; and the &quot;educated. God-fearing women of 11 Knoxville are going to have to vote in pure self-defense, and in defense of the oity government.&quot;
&quot;I have already picked out my men, And in doing so have tried to select men who stood for a better, cleaner' condition of municipal politics. Tbat Is what every modern city needs to¬ day. The general tendency ovsr th« country Is very often toward the lOfr and vicious and we of Knoxville mtiVt' see to It that men are placed In offtake who win not tolerate such a condlttc;^] 'of things. If the right men are nbl able to got Into office, I can piajiillr, see the day—not so far In the futarJKv when women wlU be running for of&gt; J
flee; and not only running for office, but getting therft. Wonen have al¬ ways had a way of getting what they wanted.
&quot;As for myselfi I still beileve that the riglttful place of woman Is In the home. Ihave always found It so, and It seems to me that the world got aloftg mighty well with that way of living. I did not register in order simply to vote, for I do not oare that much about the ballot. I did It sim¬ ply, as I said before, because I be¬ lieve that every woman of the better class owes It to herself, her children and to her community, to do what she can to aid Instralghtenlng out .the city financially, cleaning It up moral¬ ly, and In making of It a better place \ In which to live. I hear that the wo¬ men of the State of • Oklahoma, who have be*h voting for some time, have succeeded In running out the pool halls and second class shows. If that ,Js the case, then the ballot should prove ft good thing after all.&quot; '
Although Mrs. Doyle Is nearly 84 years old, she does all her own house work, and &quot;gets around as spry as any one.&quot; She Is a firm believer In the maxiuih that &quot;a person Is Just as old as she feels.&quot; When the reporter In¬ terviewed her this morning, she had Just dompleted a washing which many a younger woman would not think of doing, as &quot;help Just can not be gotten and the laundry Just islmply tears your things all to pieces.&quot;
&quot;1 hope you will encourage every good woman you knew to register and v6to when the time, comes, next Sep¬ tember,&quot; concluded Mrs. Doyle.'

I January «pssion this year. It Is ex- ^pected that many more 9f these soldieiji 'Will secure releases before the day of ; election.
'    Taking the  large  number who  have

age and iiot subject to poll taxes; those
who have Just become twenty-one years
of age, and not subject for this years

who intend to participate in the coming

that  the  coming  primary  city  election

Th? success of the wonsefK I r-art  of the registration  is  due  to jwrt {one thing—a large  number of Kulendju women put their shoulders to the whc^ and   helped   the   kngue   carry   out   t|lB 1 plans it  had made even  before   it  Waa .«iurp KnoxvlIJc women could vote&gt;.
&quot;One thing I 6*&gt;ould like to dewy In the, nartie of the league is the staleraent th;i(; it was organized as a political m^- chine to bt u.sed in the inttyest of a»7 tn^ group of candlciUes. I was Furprisod the other day when a woman told ii\s that w© have b««n accused of being a political machiiie. I told her, as th« tSMgue will tell the Knoxville public, td kindly recall the fact that the league was organiajd May 9, before we w»«« even sure tliat we could vote. The atitu legisuature had given Tennessee woman Aiu»icipal and pti-sitU&gt;nlia! sufti-.ige, l&gt;ut j^Ven the nauthoritics were declaring the ' rw^t unconKlitutiomil.

Resolution Passed Explaining  Why Named To Run For Council   On Plans Are Materializing.
No Women  Were People's   Ticket.
Members of Knox County League of Wonien Voters reaffirmed their confidence in the Committee of Eighteen Thursday afternoon with Ihe pa.ssage ot a resolution ba.sed on ihi, statement issued some days ago CO the women of the city  at large.
The resolution was offered by Miss Ada Fanz and received only ojje dis¬ senting vote. The statement em¬ bodied In the resolution reads as fol¬ lows:
The Knox County I..cague of Women Votera has complete con¬ fidence in the men and women of the Nominating Committee of the People's ticket and we know that Thoy are riot opposed to women In public  office.
Wo know that the ahsence of a woman o.andldate for position of ; Councilrwoman-at-large is due to the refusal of a number of repre. sentatlve women who declined to make the race utter earnest solici¬ tation o.i the part of the commit¬ tee. The refu.sal of these women to run was not due to any belief In the Inferiority of their .sex, but was due to their conviction that the wilier experience of, men In public work beat fitted them to Inaugurate a' new' form of City Governnieiit.
We beWeve tliat tho office should seek the woman and not the wom- man the office, and we deplore the uctloii of any woman running In opposition to the selected candi¬ dates of the People's Ticket. The  division   In   thp   tfnnv  rn^r^tx.

The thing.s that women will be able to accomplish through organi¬ zation, l*d the need for their par- tilpatlon ill pollutes were presented to Knoxville women yesterday In two stirring addresses,by Mrs. John M. Kenny, president of the Tennes¬ see League of &quot;Women Voters.
Mrs. Kenny has been an ardent work&amp; for equal suffrage for sev¬ eral year.s and based ber message Ion her own personal experiences trough thla period and her careful *udy «* present voMticai^ situations in the nation, in the state and in the municipalities. Mrs. Kenny's first address was made at Uie luncheon tendered In her honor at nooni at the T. W. C A. by the League of Women Voter.^ and which wns attended by both men jind wromen. Later she ad¬ dressed a large number of Women at the Lyceum building.
In her talk at the luncheon Mra Konny confined herself tn a dlaciis- sion of the alms of the I.icague of Women Voters and the reason lor the existence of sucli an organiza¬ tion. This. Mra. Kenny expla'.ned. was primarily in order that women might through standing shoulder to shoulder, regardlesM of party organ', ssatlon, be able to procure recogni¬ tion and bring about through their exercise of suffrage tho many things Ihat as women they saw and ft&gt;lt the nee.J of.
''We believe in party organias- (ipn, &quot; said Mr*. Kenny, &quot;and some¬ time we shall return to our respec¬ tive parties;, but at the present ye must stand together aa women for women, and for the bdnglng about of our  ideals of clean  government.
&quot;I believe In the League of Wom¬ en Voters us a safe and sane or¬ ganisation,&quot; said Mrs. Kenny. &quot;Be- (Mtaiie men, both democrats and re- puiilcans, could not get together in one Organization llko this, they have been prone to think that we could not, but we can.
J^ie nece«fllty of a definite pro- glitei waa Strongly stressed by Mrs. as a condition precedent to of tha League nnd to gain- le^lJrlvllege of being a3»nitted laM|jto the councils oif the principal par|)i(ie. ' This cannot be expected in a (Hei^sde after 300 yebrs of political aVa.^ktY, and patience will be necea- sary, she «ild.
il^t. Kenny outlined the four prin- ciptu thlngB for which the League of Wonien Voters stands aa being (1) Efficiency In govemiuent, and in this connection she urged upon all women fhe necessity of a careful study ot political question^ and an intelligent Vise of tho&quot; .ballot.

The importance of wompn's part lu matter bif government, with par¬ ticular reference to munlcijial affairs waa discussed (fey Mrs. Jdhn M. Ken¬ ny, president of Tenneeeee League of Women 'Votettl. in her address at the Lyceum building yeBterday af¬ ternoon.
Mrs. Kenny urged eflpecinlly the organisation of the women tt Knox- viSle and Knox county as the first step in Ibrlnging about the things tar which aa Indlvldtials they stand.

There can be no .strength without organisation and piograni, said the speaker.
Much of Mrs. Kenny's talk had to do with the work ot the Nashville League in t'he^ recent city' election and contained many suggesQons for the benoftt of local women in view of the U'pproaching inunlcipal el'-Or, tion in thle city.
&quot;Women must be made to see their opportunity tor service In situations like thi.s, and that Jhey can make their  city   Just   whin   they  want it

Governors, 88 State Legislators, One Representative iji Congress and a Secretary of State Successful at Polls —Old Parties Charj/ of Support
SINCE the tummt and shouting of tho I'scent elections have died, people are beginatag to realise ^vl^at an Important part women hail, played in tbe drama; nut I only In voting and campaigning, but also in winning elective office. iTwo women have won Ooyamorshlps, at least eighty-eight woman have t&gt;ean re¬ turned to the State Legislatures of the Ballon and one to Oongrsss, while an¬ other was elected a Secretary of State. \'S!o be sura, a great many of these who ran for office did n&lt;)t win—but there is slgnlflcanco In the fact that so many were noralnatied, and that here and Ithere they did win. In twefity-two of Ihe^a Unit»l States women entered tha Coinpatition for State offices. In eleven, women were nominated for Congress. This much has bean accomplished with In a brief four years toward reooffaiS' Ing the capabilities of the foi-mar stay- at-homes. What diies the future hold? And what has thiilyiear's history-mak¬ ing meant to Uie wlmen of the country las a whole? '
First   of   all,   tho   results   which   are nown should Ije s^t ^^!IPa.at this tlm^ Sompleiia retuffts are hot yet available, Miriam Ferguson was elected Clov- |«'nor of Texan, Mrs. N*lUe Taylcir iicss ovenior of Wyoming.  They are  both democrats. Mra..,E1SreAca B. S. Knapp, ftepubllcan.  has beei^ elected Secretary Ol State of New Toi*, and Mrs. Mary Norton of New Jersey will take her Iseat In Congress as  ths first  woman eraocratic  Representative.  These  four places are of nation-wide interest.   Ths pnt two have achieved a unique posi¬ tion for women,  but there have been tour women who have served  In  Con- grass—Miss   Rankin,    Miss    RoberUun, IMrs.  Hudi and Mra.  Nolan—and there have been two other wonien Secretaries f»f   Stata-rMrs,   Cromwell   of   Kentucky ¦ and    Mrs.    Saledad    Chacon    of    New lUeXIco.
Tho story ot Mrs. Ferguson's triumph Iwas expeeted and 1* too well knoWn to be retold. Mrs. Ross, on the other hand, bad so little publicity before election tiiat her success came as quite a sur¬ prise ouUide the State. Her husband, Iformir Governor William Roaa, diel Bddenly In October, and the votera of pr State Insisted that she take his CO and carry on his plans. She rolled ^a huge majority at the polls. It pens that tho two women Governors ^S^one In an If by a aide door, be- ^ of: '^toward   happenlnga to the!
husbands; Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Knapp, hdwcvier, went In on their own throul^ regular channaU and as a result of years of work and familiarity with raattera poiltloal. But no one seems to feel thfit the first two Will ba any less valuable to their oonatltuenolaa.

This Hat Is Impreeilve sinoe tt shofvSjj how much the old attitude f^ antagont.'im la dying out, and bi^cause It tells wlK*re women will be working for one anoUi«r in the seats of government. j
And herein Ilea a curious bit of pify- cbology. I
Women generally do not support Mo- men. Those who have handled c«m- palgns make that statement oniveiiiiij^tfy, and some of them deplore tt. At Beitl- quartera for the Woroun&gt; Vi'-iy, Sar «x«iniile;-'wa-ir.'CIa&gt;««ff1iX. Smith, B-utte Chairman, said: f
&quot;We never advocate that people sho.4ld vote for a woman almbly because shejia a woman, but we do wish that ttijqy irouid got over the idea that women Ste not as capable as men. If voters woi ild ofUy give them the benefit ot the dotlbt and look into, qualifications, a gr^t nisny more women would &lt; hold office. There are women In every branch of professional and business Ufa  'ho i^e known to bo eminet&gt;tly successful. «et tho general feeling ia that a.i elective job is too ble for them to handle.
&quot;The major parties seldom riomtnati a woman, because they don't feel that the policy la one to Inaplre tho confidence pf ^their    votera.      Soclallat.r  Prohitiitl
eleotlsna' the part eraUr.
W«iiunn&gt;ea&gt;*^^M|M'est Wemea.
&quot;Thoa;} who were elected were put tn by the men's votes. vm\ will administer their off toes as nearly (n accordonoe With party pollolos and political eapeiU- ancles aa men would do tn the same position. They are not particularly aware cf nsr Interested ta fanproving the condition ot women by means of leg¬ islation for equal rights. The vast ma¬ jority of buay housewives aro not yet awake to their responaibllitlea for help¬ ing less fortunaie womeu. They are not jret really Interested in using tbe power which the ballot gives them. It will take time—great movw^enta always do
&quot;What do you think of the UkeUb. of a woman for President f&quot;
&quot;I think It la quite probable, at some future data. 'Why not? Women have governed well as queens and empreates -~lt wouldii't b too tig a lob by any means.&quot;
That same queatloh Waa put to at leaat ten persona, both men and women, and after tha flyat aurpriaed minute of think¬ ing tliey nearly all answered to that etfeot. And one man added: &quot;¦What would we have aaid last rear to the proposition of women for Oovamors? One had better be mighty Warjr. now about saying what could hot happen.&quot;
In atudylng the official Hats of nomi¬ nations It becomea evident thot the Democrats and Republicans name a woman under only two conditions: One: When there is absolutely no chanqa for her to win; and the other, when there Is no chance for her to lo^, as shown by the party solidarity behind Mrs. Norton, for instance. While it must be :idmltted I'hat It W pretty grood party policy, progressive women think it hard that the powera that be do not give women a chance to put up a good fight on their own account. They believe, however, that tltat hiay come In due time.

A woman is required to be a person of social standing, of excellent education, of personal charm, of wealth, and with ability to make good speeches.

Morris of your city, in a communica¬ tion, says Miss Smith is In error In the above statement as to the latvs of the State of Texas, arid kindly takes .her to task with the suggestion that',^er' sisters should look up her charges 'be¬ fore taking them seriously. And In that coi.neelion he essays to set her aright with the further statement, as the truth
I of the  matter,   that Texas,   ajoni,'  wilh

Yes, Texas Is, and from the beKlnnlnpr. i.iay be classed as a community proii- eily State, but of late years it has be¬ come something more in response to the demands of the modern woman for tier &quot;rights,&quot; and though somewhat cumbrous In dimensions haa &quot;got , a •lOve&quot; on her In response to such' de-

She ia also given like control ot all her other separate property and to dispose of as may suit her whim and withoul any interference on the part of her husband; save that the Joinder of ' her husband is necessary in a convey¬ ance or encuniDrance by her of her real estate; and In the latter instonce if her spouse balk.s she may 3:0 into court and procure an order authorlzint' her to ex¬ ecute such conveyance without his Joinder therein. (See Acts of Texas Leg¬ islature of 3 917, t. 436, and of 1921, p. 251.),
Moreover, while the wife by these en¬ actments has .absolute control ov^tl^er earnings, to Cast them at the blrdsTior to the milliners, as suits her whliJ a subservient Legislature, by further/ien- actment, has provided that In the eveht of the failure -or refusal of the husband to provide for the proper support' and maihtenunce of the wife, or If he &quot;runs away&quot; to avoid the discharge of the duty, he may be brought back and be put In Jail or be put tb penal servi¬ tude until he slRiiifles a willingness to discharge hia niarllal duly.    ,

<dc:description>PETITION HOOPER TO
NAME WOMAN JUDGE
-
Mrs. L. Crozier French, well known
among   Memphis   club   women,   social workers and equal suffrage advocates
has become  a candidate for judge  of
the juvenile court at Knoxville.    She is
the first woman in the state to publicly aspire to such an office.
A number of Memphis women have
written letters supporting her Candida
cy. Mrs. French has many close
friends here. She was a prominent
figure in the convention of the Ten-
nessee Mothers' congress in Memphis
last year, and this year the congress
has indorsed (sic.) a bill enabling women to
become members of school boards and
juvenile court judges.
&quot;No policemen nor lawyers are allowed in a juvenile court of the right
character.&quot; declares a pitition (sic.) to Gov.
Hooper which has found many Mem-
phis signers, and seeking the appoint-
ment of Mrs.  French  to     the    place.
 &quot;Visitors should  be admitted   only by
tickets issued by the judge.    The whole
idea is to remove the children as far
as possible   from     the    suspicion     of
crime,  and  to  keep as secret as possible   the delinquencies of children, to
the  end that reformation may be accomplished    without    the    hardening
processes that might ordinarily follow
the ordinary trials in other courts.
&quot;It was happened that this idea has
not  obtained, with some  of the    men
 who have been placed at the head of
juvenile courts in several of our cities
and that in consequence no great im-
provement has been made in regard to
the condition of children over the old mode  of trial.    No one who has    not
served an apprenticeship to social service is fitted for the place of juvenile judge.&quot;—Memphis   News   Scimitar.

<dc:description>MRS. FRENCH WILL MAKE RACE
FOR COUNCIL FROM THE CITY
AT LARGE AS AN INDEPENDENT
Assemblage Of Women Nominate Her Unanimously And
Pledge Support To Candidacy — Nominee Declares
Citizens' Committee Made Mistake In Failing To
Name Woman.
Mrs. L. Crozier French was
unanimously endorsed as an independent candidate for councilman
from the city  at  large  by  a  group
of representative women    assembled
 at   the   Lyceum  building    yesterday
afternoon.
Mrs. French's nomination came
at the end of a rather lengthy discussion of the action of the Committee of 78 in failing to name a woman
on the People's ticket, Mrs. George
F. Mellen and Mrs. C. A. Weaver
placing her name before the meeting.
In calling the meeting to order
Mrs. French had stated that it was
not the purpose either to nominate
or endorse a candidate at this time,
but simply to discuss the situation
confronting women from its various
angles. She said she felt the citizens' committee had made a mistake
in assuming to name a ticket—a
right that was delegated alone to
the primary, and that she did not
understand how 18 people out of
100,000 could nominate 16 people on
a ticket and that nobody else should
run. She then asked for nominations
for chairman and Mrs. Stuart Towe
was chosen. Mrs. S. M. Miller was
elected secretary.
Discussion of the matter at issue
was entered unon immediately,
every woman expressing herself as
in favor of a woman on the council,
and the organization of the women
of the city to stand behind such a
candidate.
''We must not Be down on this
proposition simply because the men
do not nominate us.&quot; said Mrs.
Weaver, &quot;and I think it is not only
just but right that a woman should
enter the race.&quot;
Miss  Kate  White     said     that  she
thought   a  mistake   had   been   made
in   not   urging   more     strongly     the
candidacv of a woman earlier in the
game.    She said that she felt    very
strongly that a woman should be on
the board (missing)
with men inasmuch as they bore the
burden of taxation with them. She
said, however, that she did not feel
that anything should be done that
would hinder other groups who are
doing what they thought was for the
best interests of the city. &quot;We want
women with brains—not women
with social notoriety or those who
want to see their names in the newspaper,&quot; said Miss White.
Miss White later replied to Mrs.
H. C. Milnor who made the statement that she was not interested in
the people's ticket either for or
against it, by saying that she (Miss
White) was very much interested in
the success of Mr. Brakebill, the
people's candidate in her district and
that she was working daily for his
election.
At this juncture Mrs. French arose
and said that she wished to present
certain matters to the meeting.
&quot;I am going to tell the truth just
as thought (sic.) I were sworn.&quot; said Mrs.
French. &quot;I never tell anything but
the truth and this makes people say
that Mrs. French slaps folks in the
face. As soon as the new charter
was passed a certain woman came to
me and said, 'I hear we are to have
a woman on our ticket, and I want
to say that I want you to let me put
your name forward as a candidate.
I regard you as the logical candidate
for that place, and I believe it is
palpable to everybody that your life
work has been of a public charac-
ter. I believe you should represent
us on the ticket and want you to let
us put your name before the people.'
&quot;Then the Constitutional League
in a moment of enthusiasm advocated my candidacy, and so my hat
was in the ring. Then I understood
that I was not to do any more.
The League of Women Voters was
to do the rest—somebody else was
the  rest—and  I  was  most  unhappy
because I could not talk, and talk
for publication, but I said nothing.
Then they recommended a lady to
go on the committee of 18, and as
she was my friend, we thought the
deed was done. So I troubled myself no more about it.
&quot;But as time went on and we began to approach the period when
the ticket should be read out and
made public, I began to say to myself, 'There is nothing doing on the
woman question at all. Then I said,
'What's the news from the committee?' and she said, 'Only two wom-
ent left-- yourself and Miss Kate
White. I [said] 'Good, I shall withdraw in favor of Miss White.' She
said, 'No, don't do anything yet; 1
shall let you know.' In a day or
two she sent me word that everything was all right. I have found
out since it was all right—but not&quot;
on my side.&quot;
Mrs. French then told of the organization of the League of Women
Voters, how she had been asked to
come in and assist wtih its organization after difficulty had been experienced, that she had done so and
had  given  them her confidence.
Mrs. Weaver asked Mrs. Thomas
Peacock Miller for an expression of
her views on the subject of a woman
on the council. Mrs. Miller announced herself as being heartily in
favor not only of one woman but of
two on every board where women
can serve. She said that her own experience on the board of education
had proven that this was preferable,
and that she had the authority of
others to this effect.
Mrs. French's nomination came at
this juncture and a rising vote resulted unanimously.
In acepting the nomination Mrs.
French expressed her appreciation
and said that she had not expected
it but that she had made up her mind to  run anyway.
&quot;I am going to run for councilman of Knoxville. And if I don't
get five votes, I shall feel that I
have done my whole duty to the
cause of justice for women.&quot;
Plans for perfecting an organization in the interest of Mrs. French's
candidacy were deferred until another meeting which will be called
by Mrs. C. A. Weaver, Second district chairman of the League of
Women Voters.

<dc:description>KNOXVILLE WOMAN
FOR
SENATOR
Present indications are that Senator Shields will be appointed to the
supreme court bench in which event,
the office of United States Senator
would be vacant, and the vacancy
would have to be filled by the governor. A movement was started yesterday in Knoxville to have Gov.
Taylor appoint Mrs. L. Crozier
French to succeed Sen. Shields.
Mrs French has contributed several articles to the HERALD on political and educational matters, which
makes this appointment of local interest. She has been prominent in
many reforms in state laws, and is
held in high esteem by Knoxville people, where she has spent many years
of her life. Should Mrs. French be
appointed, she would be the first woman to ever serve in the United
States Senate. Mrs. Felton who was
recently appointed in Georgia to fill
out the unexpired term of Sen. Tom
Watson will likely never take her
seat in the senate, but will simply be
given the title of senator with the
salary for the few months of the unex</dc:description>

<dc:description>Slatery and Others Heard                                                                                                                                                          Before  introducing Dr.  R.  F.  Openhimer, also a member of the   present  board,   Mrs.   French   referred  to the fact that Mrs. Belle Karns Morris   was     &quot;unfortunately&quot;     on     the People's ticket, but that friends and supporters of Mrs. French and Mrs.
Miller were anxious that she should be     elected  as  a  member    of    the (missing)                                                            Between   three  and  four  hundred
men and women, among them several   of  the  independent   candidates
for council and school board, greeted
Mrs. French and listened to an ad-
dress into which she injected a great
deal of humor, and sarcasm directed
at the People's ticket and the committee of 18.    Mrs. French made her
talk largely an answer to an editorial
regarding her candidacy    appearing
Monday in The Knoxville News, but
digressed at intervals to discuss the
failure   of the  committee  of  18   to
place her on the People's ticket, and
the action of the League of Women 
Voters   in   withdrawing its   support
from her.    She declared that only a
small   part   of    the     Knox     County
League of Women Voters was lend-
ing  support   to   the People's   ticket,
and   that   later  on   the   organization
would establish itself as the balance
of power in things political.
Repudiation Personal
Mrs. French denied that she had
ever said the People's ticket should
be repudiated because it did not contain a woman, but that she herself
had  regulated  it.
&quot;I also repudiate the committee of
Eighteen! I do not consider that
I would be progressive if I followed
them. Men will be progressing
when they are following me.
though.&quot; said   Mrs. French.
She denied that she set the woman's movement above good government, but said that she had
worked for the enfranchisement of
women that good government might
come about. She said that she had
not sought to hold office, and that
she had never worked to put a wo-
man in public office in her life.
Mrs. French referred to the fact
that she was being accused of going
to the camp of the politicians. &quot;They
tell me they are 'slick' politicians.&quot; 
said Mrs. French, &quot;but I do not
care, if they treat me well and if
they treat everybody else well. I
cannot help what they do 'on the
sly.'
Would Keep  Men  Straight
The speaker said that many people
did not like her because she spoke
her mind too plainly, and she gave
due notice that if she were elected
to speak her mind would keep the
to speak her mind would keep the (sic.)
men straight.&quot; &quot;Perhaps I am bold
about speaking the truth.' said Mrs.
French, &quot;but its rather a relief sometimes among so many liars to see
the naked truth walking about.&quot;
She concluded her talk with an ap-
peal for support, to such a degree
that the primary would settle the
matter and she would not have to
continue her campaign for election
on  September 2,
Mrs. S. L. Branch, campaign manager for Mrs. French introduced
Mrs. Thomas Peacock Miller, candidate for member of the school
board. Mrs. Miller stated her
claims for election, the chief one be-
ing her record as a member of the
present board. She said she considered herself the school patrons candidate, and that she would continue
her best efforts to serve them if
elected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>MRS.   L.  CROZIER
FRENCH  EDITS PAPER.
It is doubtful if there is any woman
prominent in the club and literary life of
the South who would as instantly command the attention of the public in her
own enterprise than Mrs. L. Crozier
French, the brilliant club leader whose
influence is still felt in Birmingham's
club life. Mrs. French, who is now living
in her old home in Knoxville, Tenn., has
begun the publication of a monthly journal, &quot;The People,&quot; a journal of inquiry,
protest and an exponent of the people.
Contrary to the usual object of a woman's paper, the club organs and those
that discuss the fashions and other time-
ly subjects which regale the readers of
the woman's page in the daily papers.
Mrs. French will make no effort to interest readers of this class. In emphasizing her position, the editor savs:
&quot;This publication claims not to be a
guide to society ladies. It resigned all
such ambitions to the Ladies' Home Journal and similar sheets. You will not learn
from these columns how to butter your
bread, or hold your fork. The best manner of folding your napkin will be left
to your imagination. It will not undertake to instruct you in the number of the
hairs of your head, nor the proper number of kisses you should give to your
sweetheart. The editor of this journal
takes it for granted that its readers are
not inmates of institutions for the feeble
minded.&quot; 
In a somewhat lengthy editorial, Mrs.
French leaves no doubt, however, as to
the policy of &quot;The People.&quot; With her
usual comprehensiveness and frankness
she outlines the policy of her journal.
Education will occupy much space in
&quot;The People,&quot; education is the highest
and broadest sense of the word, including schools, the theatre, pleasures, ethical questions,  health.
Mrs. French is particularly interested
in municipal affairs of her own city. In
an open letter, she has already challenged the &quot;ring leaders,&quot; and she calls
attention to certain municipal problems
that will be discussed from time to time
in her journal. Briefly the policy of &quot;The
People&quot; is:
The People is not the propagander of
any set of tenets, be they religious, political, philosophical or scientific. The
People will investigate, as opportunity
offers, any subject that is of vital interest to humanity, but will dogmatize,
about none. Great principles will be
studied, and the endeavor will be to
show how they may be made to govern
the practical affairs of life. The policy
will be to treat every subject with candor, but it is hoped with perfect good
nature. The private character of no man
or woman, nor their private affairs will
be considered legitimate subjects for discussion in these columns. Public officials,
together with all those, be they men or
women, who are in professions that bring
them before the public, will be dealt with
as may seem fit from time to time, but
neither flattery, nor spite will be permitted to dictate the spirit of any criticism. Institutions and people will stand
on their own merit. The policy of The
People will be controlled neither by fear,
nor  favor.&quot;
Among the contributors to Mrs.
French's journal is her sister, Miss L.
Graham Crozier, a woman of national
prominence as a lecturer, teacher, essayist. With two such gifted women, &quot;The
People&quot; will be conducted on the broadest
lines, and will interest a large class of
readers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>GENERAL KNOX
LOOKS THEM OVER
AND WRITES A FEW
OPEN LETTERS
TO MRS. L. C. FRENCH,
President Ossoli Circle—
DEAR MRS. FRENCH: Your calling of a mass meeting
for Sunday afternoon to hear a lecture on &quot;Selected Motion
Pictures&quot; and to have an open forum on that subject, is a
splendid act of good citizenship.
The picture play is here to stay and I am glad of it. But
I think that most picture plays are not suitable mental food
for boys and girls and some of them are not fit for grown-ups
to see.
Censorship is not the remedy. The motion picture, like the
drama, the play, and the newspaper, is an interpretation of
life, and a criticism of government and institutions. As such a
form of art, the motion picture must be free, or we will never
find out the truth about life, nor solve the problems of society
But that does not mean that we must meekly stand for the
salacious stuff the movie producers often give us in the name
of &quot;art.&quot; We can put such movies out of business simply by
refusing to see them and by not allowing our children to see
them. Best of all, we can let the manager of the theater know
in no uncertain terms that he cannot have our patronage if he
does not cut out that sort of movie.
The boycott of the indecent movie is not all that is required.
Some pictures, while good for grown-ups, are not suitable for
the young.    Special matinees should be given with films suitable for children
If the churches, women's clubs and parent-teacher associations would guarantee to movie managers a certain audience
of children on Saturdays, they would be glad to show special
films for children and young people at that time, I am sure,
and one movie a week is enough for the child.
General Knox.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nonsensorship and the Movies
AT LEAST there is something to be  thankful for. After all, this coun- 
try is not in such a bad way as Mr.  Harold Stearns and his friends would
have us believe, and Messrs. William
H. Anderson and John S. Sumner almost make us believe that it is. When
Massachusetts, the original Pilgrim
state, homestead of American Puritanism and fountainhead of all uplift,
defeats state censorship of motion pictures by a majority of 340 000 votes
there is hope for the salvation, of the
American soul-east, west, south and
north of Kansas.
The result of the Massachusetts ref
erendum has a number of interesting
features. The proposal upon which the
voters had to pass conferred the power of determining what pictures should be barred because of being &quot;obscene...inhuman, or such as to tend to debase...morals&quot; upon the Commisioner of Public Safety.  This official's juris-
diction includes the state police, fire
prevention, the Division of Explosives
and the Bureau of Boiler Inspection,
to be sure films, being made of cellu-
loid, may be technically classed as explosives; and it is quite possible that
the advocates of movie censorship had
in mind a branch of the Bureau of
Boiler Inspection, to be called, perhaps,
&quot;Division of Potboiler Control.&quot; Be
that as it  may, the  electorate would have none of it, despite the fact that 
the  measure   was   indorsed   oy   many
&quot;wowser&quot; bodies.    (A &quot;wowzer,&quot; as de-
fined by an English friend of Mr. Fred-
erick O'Brien, of South Sea fame, is
one who practices the Golden Rule with
a vengeance, doing by others as he has
done by himself, whether the others
like it or not.) 
The vote against the censorship provision was the heaviest cast in the en- 
tire election-345,919, as against the 
416,000 which re-elected Senator Lodge. 
Although from the libertarian point
of view this refusal is highly com-
mendable, I am not sure if one should
welcome it wholeheartedly, for the film 
censorship boards already in existence 
in other states contribute to the 
of their ability to the gayety of na-
tions.  Of course., the decision of the                                                                                                                                                                                               
Pennsylvania State Board eliminating a portion of Charles Kenyon's &quot;Kindling,&quot;
where a mother was shown making
clothes for her unborn child, has be-
come a classic. It would appear that in
Pennsylvania not only is the stork the
anly authorized perpetuator of the
race, but it is assumed, in behalf of
public morality, that the visits of that
interesting bird occur altogether unheralded, a sort of joyous week-end
surprise for all parties concerned.
One would be apt to think that charity
 can be carried no further. How
ever, it can be-in Pennsylvania. In a
picture by Mrs. Mary Roberts Rinehart
a boy was shown to  have, rescued a
girl from the clutches of a cruel father. He took the young lady to a boarding
house   and,   most   properly,  bade   her
farewell at the door of her new home.
At   their   next   meeting   the subtitle
quoted the girl as saying:    &quot;I haven't
seen you since you brought me here.''
Nothing  wrong  with  that,  is   there?
Well, not for you or me, perhaps, but
the state censors of Pennsylvania are made   of   sterner   stuff   and  equipped
with    subtler   brains.     They    looked
at one another with a knowing glance,
and exclaimed in chorus: &quot;Aha!&quot;  The
title was changed to &quot;I haven't seen
you since I came here.&quot;
Nor are the Pennsylvania film censors
insensible to the danger lurking in the screenization of bad grammar. A sub-
title in  a scenario by  Mrs.  Rinehart ran   &quot;Now Ain't the Mill Nice!&quot;   The board decided that whatever this caption is  it ain't nice, and cut it.


Kansas is good, but Ohio is better—
perhaps the best of all.   For whereas
in  other states  having movie censorship all films are regarded as innocent
until proved guilty bv some relentless &quot;wowzer,&quot; in Ohio the reverse is the case.  All films are considered guilty
The statute decrees that only such films may be exhibited in the Mother State of Presidents as are &quot;in the judgment and discretion of the censoros moral, educational, or amusing...</dc:description>

<dc:description>YOU ARE INVITED To Attend Lecture on
Movies Sunday.
Mrs. L. C. French, president of
Ossoli, Saturday invited Knoxville
mothers and fathers-—and their
families too—to attend the open
forum on motion pictures to be
held at 3 p. m. Sunday at the
Bijou theater.
Mrs. Philip Speed, of University of Virginia, will be the speaker. &quot;Mrs. Speed is being sent out
by the General Federation of Women's Clubs to campaign for better motion pictures,&quot; said Mrs.
French Saturday. &quot;She realizes
the important fact that pictures;
must be made better before the
camera films them—not afterwards, with a censor's scissors.
Opposes  Censorship
&quot;Mrs. Speed is opposed to censorship. She dwells on moving
pictures from the point of view of
the mother. She is a mother herself .
&quot;During the war, Mrs. Speed
selected pictures for soldiers in
the army camps.
&quot;We want every parent to attend the meeting Sunday. Our
interests in the movies is constructive not  destructive.&quot;
Prof. Frank Nelson will give a
musical recital at the meeting.
There is no admission charge.</dc:description>

<dc:description>GIVES ADVICE
AS TO MOVIES
Ignore the Bad Ones, Says
Lecturer at Tivoli.  Mrs. Speed Talks About Better
Films-Co-Operative Committee to Be Formed.
Mrs. Phillip Speed, of the national
committee for better films, of New
York, lectured at the Tivoli theater-
yesterday morning, under the auspices
of the welfare department of Kosmos,
on the subject of &quot;Better Films.&quot;
&quot;Better films committees are increasing throughout the south, and their influence is already felt in those communities in which they are firmly established,&quot; said Mrs. Speed,&quot; and within
the next few  weeks  probably  all  the largest cities in the southern states
will have committees of men and
women actively engaged in the interest
of better films, working in co-operation with all agencies for the sole purpose of promoting the production and
exhibition of better films.
&quot;One of the principal achievements
of these committees you already have
here-and there are but 60O cities in
all the United States who have them--
is your Saturday morning matinees for
the boys and girls, which give clean,
wholesome but none the less fascinating, delightful entertainments for the
children. Parents may send their sons
and daughters to see these programs
without fear that there may be objectionable features.     To   be  sure,   it  is
often said that adolescent boys and
girls very strenuously object to pictures
that are for children alone, but this is
the result of too many highly-seasoned
menus, and will in time be overcome.
&quot;There are three audiences always to
consider-the children, the adolescent
boy and girl, and the adults. There
are also divisions of the latter class,
the ignorant, the average and the above
the average, or the very highest class
of patron. The latter was primarily
the basis of the national board of reviews being formed. Pictures that
were condemned at once by what in
common parlance are known as &quot;high
brows&quot; were not at all harmful, according to the viewpoint of the average
people, and one incident after the other
occurred in clashes between the two
factions. At length, in desperation,
and through the advice of the People's
Institute of New York, which is a
clearing house of invaluable information regarding people and things, a
happy medium was reached in the
forming   of  the  national  board  of  reviews. The   board   is   composed   of  
broad, liberal-minded men and women,
who give due consideration to every
point before rendering a decision. This
board has been of untold value to exhibitors.
of Kosmos. 
&quot;The better film committees  obtain
best results not by knocking a picture,
but by telling of the best points in it.
To knock it is to advertise it in the
best  possible  way.    Exhibitors  would
all rather be praised than abused, and
would far rather show clean pictures.
However,  the  great majority  is their
best patron,  and to that patron they
 have  to  cater if they    support   their
houses.    Therefore,  we must work to
 the  end in view, the general support
of the public of better films.    To that
end we  must work most assiduously.
The music clubs have here a.splendid
field for their work by looking out for
the music that is heard on these occasions.    A   band   of   truth,   of  beauty,
may   be   placed   around    the    world
through the right sort of pictures, and
it may be shown by the light of the
torch  of  education  that is  carried in
the   hands   of   the    states.    Through
school and church the knowledge may
be diffused by  the pictures of educational   films;   there    are    geographical
films—films of centrifugal nature that
will, in  a few  minutes teach the boy
and    girl    more    about    the    ethereal
bodies that are swinging round us into
space,  more  of  the  worlds   that    are
fixed  or  movable  planets   than  could
be   taught  them  in  a  whole  term  of
plain old-fashioned teaching.
 &quot;Tuberculosis films have gone far
on the road as successful missionaries
of   health   and   hygiene,    and    every branch  of science  has  done its  share
 in later years, a far bigger and better share than ever before because of
moving pictures.
&quot;The family  group is the best medium  for better films.    Strange as it
may seem,  unless a picture   is   high-
priced,   parents  do  not    minutely   inquire as  to  the how  and why  of  it.
Let  a  picture  be priced  away above
the average,  and before parents give
the money  for it to  the boy   or girl,
they  will   find   out  a  little  about   the
nature of it.    Some very beautiful les-
sons may  be learned  from  pictures—
but   other   things   may   be,   and   are,
learned  from  the  wrong kind  of  pictures.    Form   your  better   films   committees,  and  be  sure to   make   them
broad,   have  one  member  from  every
organization in  your city, church and
school  included,   especially    from    the
Parent-Teacher  associations. Make no
mistake   here,   for   there   must   be   no
narrow  minds  on  the  subject.    Three
out of six pictures shown may be good
ones.    Boost  the  three,    but   let   the
ones  that  are not    good   remain    unmolested.    This is far the better way.
Every one  cannot  like the same  picture- point out the best you can find
in all.&quot;
There was a very good attendance
at the lecture, and at its close there
was a strong indorsement of what
Mrs. Speed represented. During her
visit through the state, she has organized many committees, and experts
to continue the work, but always
along the broad lines of the board of
national review. Mrs. Speed left last
night for Virginia, but returns to East
Tennessee in a week's time. The
formation of a better film committee
is to be effected at once. All interested in the work of the committee
are requested to communicate with
Mrs. M. N. Whitaker, president of
Kosmos, or Mrs. Harry Wise, chairman,   or  Mrs.   D.   F.   Beckham,  vice-chairman of the   welfare   department
of Kosmos. </dc:description>

<dc:description>A Call to Southern
Governers
One of the most significant indications of progress of 
the movement in the South was the tenor of the call sent you last   November   to   the   Governors   of  the   Southern 
States, written by Miss Kate Gordon and signed by the 
Presidents and leading members of the Southern Suffrage 
organizations.    It read as follows: 

&quot;The undersigned women of the Southern States, on the 
part of the Suffragists of their respective States, earnestly 
request the Governors of the Southern States or their rep- 
resentatives to meet them in conference in New Orleans, 
November 10-11, to discuss and adopt a uniform plan of 
action for the adoption of Woman suffrage in the South. 
&quot;We are united in the belief that Suffrage is a State 
right,  and that the power to define a  State's electorate 
should remain    the    exclusive   right   of the   State. How- 
ever, we recognize that Woman Suffrage is no longer a 
theory to be debated, but a condition to be met.    The in- 
evitable 'votes for women' is a world movement, and un-
less   the   South squarely faces the issue and   takes   steps 
to preserve the State right, the force of public opinion will 
make   it   mandatory   through   a   National   Constitutional 
   Amendment. 
     &quot;In fact, the National Council of Voters, consisting of 
enfranchised women, has for its object the influencing of 
national legislation to  secure  the ballot for the women 
who have not yet received it.   While as Southerners we wish   to see the power of the State retained, yet as women we 
are  equally  determined  to  secure,  as  of paramount im- 
portance, the right which is the birthright of an American 
 citizen. 

&quot;We, therefore, appeal to you gentlemen vested with 
it  the power to so largely shape conditions, to confer with                                                                                                              us and influence public opinion to adopt Woman Suffrage 
through State action.    Failing to accomplish this, the onus 
of responsibility will rest upon the men of the South if 
Southern women are forced to support a national amend- 
 ment, weighted with the same objections as the Fifteenth 
Amendment. 
          &quot;Hoping for an early and favorable response,</dc:description>

<dc:description>SOUTHERN STATES WOMAN SUFFRAGE fCONFERENCE. 
Declaration of Principles. 

The following resolutions were unanimous-
ly adopted on Suffrage Day by the Southern 
States Woman Suffrage Conference: 
&quot;Whereas,   woman   suffrage   is   a   world 
movement now conceded as inevitable; and, 
&quot;Whereas, 9,000,000 women in the indus- 
tries of this so-called republic need the ballot 
for protection as much as the workingmen 
need it, demonstrating thereby that woman 
suffrage is no longer a theory to be debated, 
but a condition to be met; and, 
&quot;Whereas, there are but two ways of se- 
curing this extension of suffrage to women, 
through a national amendment to the Consti- 
tution or through the State submitting to the 
voters the question; and,
&quot;Whereas, we believe suffrage is a State 
right, and not a Federal right, and that the 
best interests of the nation will be conserved 
by preserving to the State the right to de- 
fine its electorate; be it 
&quot;Resolved, That we women of the South, 
guided by the lessons of the past, do affirm |
our faith in self-government, not alone for in- 
dividuals,   but   in   self-government   for  the 
State, as the greatest constitutional heritage 
 which, in the wisdom of the framers of our 
 government, was chosen to insure a free man 
and a free State as the central ideals of de-
mocracy; be it further
  &quot;Resolved, That the time has come for the 
 Democratic Party, the State rights party, to 
 record itself in favor of 'Votes for Women,' 
 and to this end we, the men and women of 
 the South, consecrate our best efforts to make 
 the party so record itself.&quot;

<dc:description>
The legal Research Department of the Wman's Party has not
entirely completed its survey of the Tennessee laws relating to
women.  Only major subjects have been covered.  The following is
a list  of some   of  Tennessee's discriminations  against women:
1  (stricken through) The father alone is the natural guardian of his children. Ross v. Cobbm 9 Yer. 463: Miles v. Kaigler, 10 Yer. 10.  The mother is not a natural guardian of her own child unless the father is dead
or a deserter.
2.  When a married woman dies without a will, her husband gets
her entire personal estate.   On the other hand, when a married man
dies without a will, his wife gets only a child's share in his personal estate.
Only if there are no children does she get his
entire personal estate.
3.  The husbandis entitled to use for his life all the
real estate of his deceased wife, provided a child
was born
alive during the marriage.  
The wife, on the other hand, is entitled to use for her
life of only one-third of her deceased husband's lands.
4.  Women are excluded from jury service.
5.  The father inherits all the personal estate of a child
who dies without a will and without descendants.  The mother inherits
the personal estate of her deceased child only if the father is dead,
and even then she must share the inheritance with the brothers and
sisters of the decedent.
6.  A mother is not entitled to sue for damages for an injury
to her minor child unless the father is dead or has deserted.  The
right to sue belongs exclusively to the father except in the in-
stances named.
7. A husband is entitled to his wife's services and he may
recover for the loss of such services by reason of personal in-
juries sustained by her. In such a case the wife collects damages
only for her pain and suffering. When a married man is injured,
he recovers all damages.

AN ACT to amend Section 2 and to repeal Section 4 of Chapter
126 of the Public Acts of Tennessee, 1919, the same
being an Act entitled &quot;An Act to remove disabilities
of converture from married woman, and to extend to
them the statutes of limitation and to exempt to them
a homstead and to proride for giving to the wife equal
right with the husband to claim exemptions of property
from judgment lien, execution or forced sale, and to
repeal conflicting laws.
Section 1.  Be- it enacted by the General Assembly of the
State of Tennessee, That Section 2  or an Act entitled &quot;An Act
entitled  'An Act to remove disabilities of coverture from
married women, and to extend to them the statutes of limitation
and to exempt to them a homstem' &quot;  be and the same is hereby
amended so as to reas (sic.) as follows: &quot;Be it further enacted, That
nothing in this Act shall be construed as abolishing tenancies
by the entirety, but the provisions of this Act shall be construed as conferring upon the wife equal rights with the husband
as to the management, control, use, enjoyment, ownership and
disposition of property held by the entirety and the rents and
profits therefrom.  Nor shall this Act be construed as affecting
the husband's rights of dower when the wife dies intestate or 
his right to dissent from her will and claim dower  if she dies
intestate.
Section 2.  Be it further enacted, That Section 4 of
said Act, be and the same is hereby repealed.
Section 3.  Be it further enacted, That all exemptions
of property from judgment lien, execution or forced sale now
allowed by law to the head of the family may be claimed by the
husband an wife jointly, or by either with the written consent of the other, or half of said exemptions may be claimed by
each spouse; but in no case shall both the husband and wife be
entitled each to all exemptions allowed by law to the head of a

THE FIRST  THING NECESSARY TO  BRING  ABOUT  UNIFORMITY OF MARRIAGE
AND DIVORCE LAWS   IS  TO  HAVE THOSE LAWS MADE AT  THE NATIONAL   INSTEAD  OP  AT  48   STATE CAPITALS.   WE MUST  WIPE OUT   STATE LINES   IF
WE WOULD   INAUGURATE MANY DESIRED   REFORMS.      MR WILSON BEGAN     THIS
WHEN HE  APPLIED  THE  ARTISTS  GUM  IN HIS  SUSCESSFUL  EFFORT   IN  PASSING THE  INTERSTATE CHILD LABOR LAW.     CONGRESS  WILL MAKE THE
LINE FAINTER WHEN   IT   PASSES  THE PROHIBITION LAW.     AND  THIS NEXT
CONGRESS WILL NO DOUBT MAKE IT  ENTIRELY DISAPPEAR WHEN   IT   PASSES
THE FEDERAL  AMENDMENT  FOR WOMAN   SUFFRAGE.   WHEN THE WOMEN  ARE
ENFRANCHISED  THEY MAY GO  TO  WORK IN  EARNEST  TO  PROTECT  THE HOME
AND  AMONG  THEIR FIRST  ACTS  WILL  BE THE MARRIAGE LAWS     WHICH  CON-
STITUTE THE FOUNDATION  OF  THE HOME.</dc:description>

<dc:description>MENTAL ARITHMETIC

By Alice S. Cheyney
Ten  little  reasons  why  a vote  she
would decline!
She stepped into a meeting, and came
out with only nine.
Nine  anti  arguments,  time  worn  in
debate!
The times  bring suffrage  new ones,
so they've left her only eight.
Eight anti instincts, she says come
straight from Heaven!
She has a sense of humor, though, so
holds to only seven.
Seven reasons why &quot;the home&quot; and
politics won't mix!
They've  taken  the  sweeper  off  her
street, and now there 're only
six.
Six   little  reasons  why  the  suffrage
cause can't thrive!
The men are going over, though, and
soon there's only five.
Five reasons!   But she's ready now to
think about it more,
So friends have sent her pamphlets
till she clings to only four.
Four faithful reasons she thinks must
ever be!
Until she  takes  the  Journal,  which
leaves a shaky three.
(missing)  are    many
things no lady ought to do!
The antis now do all of them, and
leave her only two.
Two left! But she will finish now
what is so well begun.
Her husband's asking questions, and
has left her only one.
One  little  reason  left  why  suffrage
 may be wrong!   
An anti  tried to win her back, and
now she's for us, strong!</dc:description>

<dc:description>HIGHER TYPE OF MOVIES SOUGHT  City-Wide Committee Requested After Able Address On
Selected Pictures
A resolution requesting that the
president of Ossoli Circle invite the
different woman's clubs, the Parent
Teachers Association, the men's civic
organizations and clubs, the Board of
Commerce and the Superintendent of
Schools each to appoint two representatives to serve as a committee to
consider some definite action looking
toward better films was proposed by
Dr. J. M. Switzer of the University of
Tennessee and unanimously passed
at the mass meeting of men and women called at the Bijou Theatre yesterday afternoon to hear Mrs. Philip
Speed on the subject of &quot;Selected
Motion Pictures.&quot;
The resolution formed the climax
of a most interesting discussion in
which a number of the prominent club
men and womeen (sic.) of the city participated, as well as the two speakers present.
Prior  to   the     address    two     very
charming vocal  selections  were rendered  by  Mr.   Frank   Kelley,   accompanied by Mr. Frank Nelson. The solos   given   were     &quot;The     Ninety-first
psalm,&quot;   by   Macdermid;     and     &quot;The
Great Awakening,&quot; by Kramer.
Inventions of the Age
Mrs . L. C. French, president of Ossoli,  who  presided  over  the  meeting,
introduced the speaker. In her opening  Remarks   she   stated  that  in  this
age of invention and discoveries, two
inventions  stood  out  beyond  all  the
others.  These  were  automobiles  and
the  motion  picture.&quot;  The  latter,  she
said, &quot;was at first sneered at by the
intelligent,  and  later  branded  as an
amusement for women and children,
but today,&quot;  she declared,  &quot;at an afternoon   performance  when   the   men
are   supposed   to   be   engrossed   with
business,   there   are   often   four   men
to one woman present.&quot;
&quot;Everything ought to be criticized
in a friendly spirit,&quot; she continued.
'Criticism rightly given should lend
to progress, and for this reason the
people of Knoxville were called together to discuss the subject of motion pictures.&quot; In naming Mrs. Philip
Speed the speaker for the afternoon,
she said that Mrs. Speed had always
been particularly interested in better pictures, especially for the children, and that it was through her efforts that the Children's Theatre was
founded in New York before the war.
Mrs. Speed is visiting the different
cities of Tennessee under the auspices of the General Federation of Woman's clubs and the National Committee for Better Films.
Train Parents First
In taking the floor, Mrs. Speed said
that her work was of an educational
nature. Foolish parents could not be
prohibited from taking their children
to pictures they had no business to
see, but the parents would have to be
trained into a knowledge of the right
kind of films which the child should
see. 
A national censorship will answer
the purpose of giving out the films
suited to any particular group. The
censors must pass what is desired by
the majority of-people. But it does
publish a list of better plays which
should prove helpful to a local committee which is trying to educate the
people of the community.
Mrs. Speed said that there should
be three sets of pictures approved by
a committee for better films; those
suited for the child; the family group
pictures, suited for the adolescent
boys and girls; and the pictures only
suited to the adult mind.
She particularly urged the Saturday morning matinees at which a
carefully arranged children's program was given. One picture a week is
sufficient for any child, she said, and the parents should cooperate in sending their children to the Saturday
matinees in order that the theatre
manager should not lose by his efforts
to give the public what was demanded.
Study Child Pictures
Miss M. B. Kennedy of Nashville,
who followed Mrs. Speed, said that a
committee of child psychologists had
been appointed who were making a
study of the pictures best suited to
the child and the adolescent, and were
formulating standards to govern the
selection of such pictures.
In emphasizing the importance of
selected pictures she said that for a
child to see or hear a thing was to
render that thing possible in its life,
and therefore they should never be
permitted to see pictures which are
meant only for the adult mind.
At the close of Miss Kennedy's talk,
the meeting was thrown open for
discussion. Mrs. W. F. Roth, president of the Parent Teachers association of Moses School, urged that a
White List, rather than a Black List
of Pictures be published and endorsed.</dc:description>

making women eligible to serve on
school boards.&quot;
A rising vote of thanks was given
the Knoxville ladies for their beautiful
hospitality.

<dc:description>Differences Arising Over Selection of Convention City   
are Serious,
Special  to   The  Knoxville  Sentinel
MEMPHIS, May 22.—The trouble in
the suffrage ranks of Tennessee shows
no signs of abatement. Each side in
the controversy is insisting that it is
right.      As   a   result   the   national   con-
ention may not be held in Tennessee,
several of the local associations of the
state threaten to withdraw from the
wing of the national organization and
form an independent southern association, and the legality of the election of
Mrs. L. Crozier French, Knoxville, as
head of the Tennessee association, is
about to be questioned, says Anne Spencer  in   the   News-Scimitar.
Claims of irregularities have filled the
air, and the fight, which many seem
willing to admit is really just starting,
has already put to shame some of the
memorable political feuds that have in
years past shaken the state from end
to end.
The whole matter now seems to be up
to the executive committee of the national association. There appears to be
some hitch here also, for while Mrs.
French and Mrs. Guilford Dudley, president of the Nashville association, claim
that the national executive committee
has indorsed the action of the majority
of the state committee in selecting
Nashville as the next meeting place, lo-
cal suffrage leaders are equally sure that
no final action in the matter has been
taken.
Mrs. J. M. McCormack, president of
the Memphis Equal Suffrage association,
and vice-president at large for the state
organization, has been in close communication with Mrs. Desha Breckenridge, of
Lexington, Ky., second vice-president of
the national association, and Mrs. Breckenridge, she says, has not been called
on  to  vote  upon  the meeting place.
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of
the national association, is in Rome, attending the International Congress of
Women; Miss Jane Addams, vice-president of the association, is closely confined to her home by the severe illness
of her mother; so that Mrs. Breckenridge at present is the presiding officer of the association, and it is a little
extraordinary, it is claimed, that she
should not be aware of the action of
the executive committee, of which she
is chairman protem, in selecting Nashville as the meeting place of the association. If such action has been taken
it is without her knowledge and consent,
it is said.
Deadlock started   Row.
The present strife between the suffragists of the state is of comparatively
recent date and grew out of the announcement by the national association
that the next convention would be held
in Tennessee, leaving the selection of
the city, however, to be decided by
the Tennessee association. Chattanooga, Memphis and Nashville at once put
in bids for the gathering and the fight
was on.
The claims of these three cities were
left to the members of the state executive board and balloting by mail began. In the meantime Miss Sarah Elliott, of Sewanee, president of the association, had tendered her resignation
to the executive board, and Mrs. McCormack, vice-president at large, had
become president.
Several ballots were taken, resulting
in a tie between Nashville and Chattanooga, each city receiving four votes.
Then two other ballots resulted in a tie
between Memphis and Nashville. There
are two Nashville women on the executive board and two Jackson women.
Jackson has supported the claims of
Nashville from the beginning, and one
of the members from Jackson announced
her determination to &quot;stand by Nashville   till   the   cows   come   home.&quot;
Realizing the impossibility of breaking
the deadlock and acting on the advice
of the secretary of the national society,
Mrs. McCormack took the matter out of
the hands of the executive board and
submitted it to the leagues throughout
the state, at the same time notifying the
board members of her action, and calling a meeting for the purpose of canvassing the returns.
At the meeting held in Memphis last
week there were present two Nashville
women and two Jackson women. As
there were only six members of the committee present, this gave Nashville a
clear majority on the board.
Secretary  on   &quot;Strike.&quot;
In a detailed account of this meeting,
Mrs. McCormack says that Mrs. Dudley
instructed the secretary to refuse to
record the votes of the suffrage leagues
of the state, which gave a two-thirds
majority  for  Chataanooga (sic).
Thereupon Mrs. McCormack called in
Miss Frances Church, who acted as secretary  pro tem.
In the election which followed Mrs.
McCormack and Mrs. French were both
nominated for president. Mrs. McCormack withdrew, thus leaving Mrs. French
the only candidate in the field. Her
election, however, was not unanimous,
for both Mrs. McCormack and Miss Price,
president of the Morristown league,
voted against her, thus registering their
disapproval of the choice of the other
members of  the committee.
Later in the day Mrs. French called a
second meeting of the executive committee, ignoring Mrs. McCormack and
Miss Price in the call, reversed the action of the previous meeting, and declared Nashville the choice of the state
as the meeting place of the national con-
vention.
Local   suffragists   say   that   the   whole proceeding was  out of order,  since Mrs
McCormack   had   been   sustained   in   her
ruling that  the    leagues    of    the    state
should   be   allowed   to   decide   by     their
vote which city should be  selected,  and
these   leagues   had   by   a   large   majority
chosen   Chattanooga.      Mrs. French   her-
self   consented   to   this   plan   of   voting,
and   sent   in   the  vote   of  the   Knoxville
league   for   Nashville.      Only   the   Nashville league and the  Jackson league refused to vote.     However,  even had they
voted, Chattanooga would still have won.
According   to   prominent   members    of
both   suffrage   associations   in   Memphis,
it   was   unconstitutional   for   the   second
meeting, which was irregular, to r[everse]
the   action   of   the   first   meeting

<dc:description>CROZIER-FRENCH DELEGATION
Probably  Will   Be  Seated  in
Nashville Convention
Of the National Woman's Suffrage Association.
President Shaw Refuses to Be
Side-tracke by Election as
President-Emeritus.
Special   to   The   Journal   and   Tribune.
Nashville, Tenn., Nov. 11.—-Delega-
tions of women from practically every 
state in the union arrived in Nashville 
Tuesday night and today to attend the 
annual convention of the national Amer- 
ican Woman's Suffrage association 
which convenes tomorrow morning.
The national officers  and  the  majority of the most prominent leaders in the 
movement   for  equal   suffrage   came to
the   city  Tuesday  night  and  eairy   this
morning
Many of the latter are flanked by
large forces of delegates who will stand
by their respective leaders on important
questions  and  issues that may  arise.
The first, official gathering today of
the suffragists was at eleven o'clock at
the Hermitage hotel, when the executive council held a secret session. Mrs.
Raymond Brown, president of the New
York state suffrage association, was
elected temporary chairman. The selection of a temporary chairman was a
significant matter as at this meeting of
the council the policies for the coming
convention and some of the most important questions likely to come up were
to be freely discussed, among the latter
the constitutional amendment or state's
rights   in   securing   the   ballot.
That this particular question could be
impartially discussed was evident,
as Mrs. Brown heads an association
that has declared neutrality on this issue. The council this morning took no
action on any matter, holding the session
merely that there might be discussions
so that the delegates might be better
prepared for action when the proper
time  arises.
The Hermitage hotel, where the national officers and leaders are quartered,
presents an animated scene today. The
suffrage color of yellow greets the eye
from every column and doorway and
streamers hang from doorways and
chandeliers, while large groups of suffragists throng the parlors and loggia as
they get acquainted and discuss the all-
absorbing  topic  of   &quot;the   ballot.&quot;
The   national   officers   here   are:—Dr. 
Anna   Shaw,   the   distinguished  head   of 
the   association;     Miss     Jane   Addams
Chicago, first vice-president; Mrs. Desha
Breckinridge,   Lexington,    Ky.,    second
vice-president;   Mrs.     Caroline  Ruuty
Rees, Greenwich, Conn., third vice-president; Mrs.  Richard  Fitzgerald,  Jamaica   Plain,   Mass,     recording   secretary;
Mrs.   Stanley  McCormick,    New  York
and Chicago,     treasurer;    Mrs.   James
Lees Laidlaw,  New  York,  first  auditor
and  Mrs.  Joseph  Tilton  Bowen,  Chicago,   second  auditor.
These officers participated in the deliberations of the executive council,
which met at the Hermitage hotel at
eleven   o'clock.
Hope For Peace.
Suffrage, leaders say peace between
the parent body and the congressional
union was foreshadowed by action late
tonight by a general caucus of association leaders, when a compromise slate
of officers for the association was made.
This slate is predicated upon the willingness of Dr. Anna Howard Shaw to
accept the position of president emeritus,
a new place in the organization, and
places Mrs. Desha Breckenridge, of
Lexington, Ky., at the head as president.
Dr. Shaw announced her unwillingness to accept the position of president
emeritus, immediately after the meeting.
The caucus was not called by any officer of the association and for that reason its deliberations are characterized
as &quot;irregular&quot; by friends of Dr. Shaw.
It was held in the Hotel Hermitage and
presided over by Mrs. Gertrude Leonard, of Boston, pronounced in her leanings to the doctrines of the congressional
union.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Crozier-French Delegation.
Mrs. Stanley McCormick, of Chicago,
chairman of the credentials committee,
announced Wednesday night that the Crozier-French delegation from the Tennessee association would be seated in
the convention over the McCormick delegation. This decision and the holding
of the caucus completed the preliminary
work of  the  association.
The first regular session of the convention will be held tomorrow, when
the delegates will be welcomed to the
State and city by Governor Ben W.
Hooper and Mayor Hilary E. Howse.
Response will be made by Mrs. Crozier-
French, president of the state organization, and Mrs. Guilford Dudley, on behalf of the Nashville Equal Suffrage
league. The morning session will be
devoted to routine business. The report
of the credentials committee is the chief
business of interest scheduled for Thursday. The Illinois contest is yet to be
threshed out and it is likely that the
Tennessee contest will be carried on the
floor of the convention.
More than a thousand delegaes (sic.)  and
visitors have already arrived and the
rest   will   come   Thursday   morning.
The up-town district of the city is
gay with countless yellow streamers
bearing the words &quot;Votes for Women.&quot;
Miss Jane Addams, of Chicago, was
among the leaders of note arriving this
morning. She has accepted an invitation
to speak at Vanderbilt university tomorrow.
The session of the convention Thursday night is officially designated as
&quot;cotton evening'' and all members, it
is   announced,   will   wear   cotton   frocks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mrs. French was    nominated    in
a stirring speech  by  Miss Daviess, who
referred  to   her as  a  parliamentarian
under   whose   leadership   all   business,
 would   be   conducted   legally   and   according to the constitution.     The elections   were   conducted   viva   voce,   by
unanimous  consent. 
The constitution was amended to
read that the president should choose
her own corresponding secretary for
her  term  of office.
The  delegates  to  the   national  con- 
vention   were   chosen   as  follows:
Mrs. L. Crozier French, Mrs. S. B.
McKinney and Miss Sarah Rutherford,
of Knoxville; Mrs. Guilford Dudley,
Mrs. John Kenney, of Nashville; Mrs.
Isaac Keese, of Memphis; Mrs. Frank
Woodward, of Jackson; Mrs. Case, of
Chattanooga, and Miss Isabelle Gettys,
of  Athens.
Alternates—Mrs. John Trice, of
Jackson; Mrs. M. K. Purnell, of Knoxville; Mrs. James Ezell, Miss Russey
and Mrs. Perkins Baxter, of Nashville;
Miss Moody, of Athens; Mrs. F. M.
Jones, of Chattanooga; Mrs. D. T.
Crockett and Mrs. Pryor Lilly, of
Franklin.
Mrs.   French   Speaks.
Mrs. L. Crozier French in a
lengthy address to her faction charged Miss C. J. Wester of Chattanooga
state treasurer of the association with
insubordination. When the latter asked to be heard in order, she said to
repudiate the charge and defend herself, a stir was created. Mrs. French
refused to hear Miss Wester when the
latter declined to recognize her, as the
state president and presiding officer
of the convention.
&quot;I will not hear the treasurer of the
Tennessee association until she
acknowledges the president,&quot; said
Mrs. French.
&quot;I will not recognize Mrs. French
as the presiding officer of the state
convention,&quot; said Miss Wester, who
from the beginning of the schisn (sic.)
was with the opposing faction.
Charges Are Answered.
Mrs. French answered the charges in
her address,  in  which she exonerated
herself,   Miss   White,   the  correspond-
ing  secrtary (sic.)  and  her  followers.     She
reviewed the events of Thursday, when
the split was made in the convention, 
stating that she had done all she could 
to restore order and peace.    The split 
came  Thursday when the question  of 
membership of the Morristown league.'
was raised.
In discussing the alleged insubordination of the state treasurer, Mrs.
French said:
&quot;The president is overseer as far as
she acts within her rights. Else what
is the use of having a president? The
president must be looked to for protection, and I thought I was acting as
a protector of the association when I
demanded an inspection of the books
of the association kept by Miss Wester.&quot;
She then reviewed the finances of
the year, charging that the disbursements of funds by the Morristown
league to the national association—was
twice us great as was on the previous year, and that this increase had
been paid without confirmation by the
president. This, she said, was contrary
to the constitution of the association
and was entirely irregular and unwarranted.
&quot;When I asked to see the books of
the treasurer, she defied me, and refused to let me have an intrview (sic.),&quot; said
Mrs. French.
Following Mrs. French's address a
motion was made by one of the delegates in her faction to suspend the
meeting five minutes for the purpose
of reconciliation with the other faction
and harmony.
&quot;This meeting will go on,&quot; said Mrs.
French. &quot;Those who wish to harmonize  may go and do so.&quot;
No  one moved.
&quot;Then I cannot hear the treasurer,&quot;
said Mrs. French, firmly.
Suspends Treasurer.
Miss     Wester    was    suspended    as
treasurer by Mrs. French, and this was 
confirmed by her faction.
The whole trouble was apparently
caused by the minutes of the state executive meeting of May 13. Mrs.
French's opponents charged her with
having been elected president of the
state association at that time in an ir-
regular manner, and it was also 
charged that Nashville was made the
meeting place of the national suffrage convention for November 12-17,
against a majority which chose Chattanooga. It was alleged that &quot;dirty
politics&quot; had been used in the executive functions of the president.
Miss Sue White, of Jackson, recording secretary, and an expert court reporter, whose minutes of the May
meeting of the state executive committee were challenged, made an ad-
dre[ss] in which she defended herself
against charges of misrepresentation
in   the minutes. 
Members of the faction of which 
Miss White is now recording secre- 
tary, that over which Mrs. French 
presides as president, who were pres- 
ent at the meeting of the state executive committee, testified by rising 
vote as to the correctness of the de-
tails of Miss White's minutes, as read
before the  convention.

Presidents' Statements.
There are now two state associations
of woman suffrage, according to the
stand taken by each faction of the
convention. Each side, in special
statements, maintains that its faction
or party is the only and original Tennessee  Equal   Suffrage  association.
The stand taken by that faction over
which Mrs. McCormack was elected
president is as follows:
&quot;While we were in session Thursday afternoon, waiting for reports of
committees, those headed  by Mrs.
French wished to stop the meeting and
go auto riding, thus to delay important matters. There were many of
us who wished to stay and settle all
differences, and we were not willing
to substitute pleasure for business.
&quot;When the other faction left the
room, We carried the convention on,
appointing temporary chairman and
other officers. We received reports
from committees appointed temporarily, and this morning those reports
were confirmed.
&quot;At 9 o'clock Friday morning, we
met and were ready for business at
the stated time. We waited for a
quarter of an hour for the convention
to gather as scheduled, and then began where we had left off yesterday.
The minutes were read. While this
was being done, the other faction entered and seated itsalf at the other
end of the room independently of us.
We considered ourselves the regular
convention and have acted so. Our
officers are elected, and we maintain
that we are the Tennessee Equal Suffrage  association.&quot;
Do   Not   Recognize   Opponents.
&quot;We refuse to recognize the opposing faction as being the Tennessee
Equal Suffrage association, or any
part of it,&quot; was the statement of members of the faction of the state convention headed by Mrs. L. Crozier
French. &quot;Ours is the recognized state
association, and this convention has
not change it.&quot; Mrs. French is a rea-
ognized member of the national association, and the Tennessee Equal Suffrage association is affiliated with the
national.
&quot;The 'bolting' of the opposing fac-
tion in this convention removes the
'bolting' members automatically from
membership in the state association
and from affiliation with the national
association.&quot;
The only settlement, in view of the
question of which will be the recognized state association, affiliated with
the national associaton, will be a decision of the national evecutive com
mittee,  according  to  the  members  of
each faction.
Miss Wester's Statement.
Miss Wester, treasurer, charged with
insubordination to the president and
violating the constitution on eight
counts, said that she had entered on
the books all checks and monies submitted to her. The counts were not
specified. The trouble, she said, seemed to arise over the fact that a check
from a Nashville club made out to the
president, Mrs. French, and not to the
treasurer, had been received after the
books were closed and the treasurer
naturally had not entered this on the
books, as she had not seen the check
until the morning of the convention.
As each club is allowed so many
votes in the convention according to
the amount paid in to the treasury,
the report of the  treasurer assumed
vast importance.
The report of the treasurer and of
the auditing and credentials commit- 
tee was part of the cause of the split, 
Miss Wester's report was accepted by 
the convention over which Mrs. Mc-
Cormack presided. It was not accept- 
ed by that over which Mrs. French 
presided and Miss Wester was sus- 
pended because she refused to recognize Mrs. French as president.

<dc:description>Shall
Tennessee Women
Be Bond or Free?
By Mrs.  L.  Crozier French

The position of the married women, according to the laws of
Tennessee, is nothing more or less
than that of a slave. It may be
very provoking to many of the
residents of the state to have
such a statement made, but the
reiteration of disagreeable truths
is a necessity if reforms are to be
carried forward.
In 1909 being chairman of one
of the study sections of Ossoli, I
brought to the notice of the members, the legal status of the women of Tennessee. The women
were amazed to find that a married woman in this commonwealth
loses control of all her property,
real and personal and cannot make
a will except under great restrictions. That she has no legal
right to the control of her children, and that though the law
gives her husband control of all
she possesses, there is no adequate punishment for him if he
fails to use this property for the
support of wife and family. If
this is not the condition of a
slave then I do not know what a
slave's condition is.
Women hawing been kept in ig-
norance of their true position here the law, this condition of
things was a surprise to most of
the members of Ossoli. A motion
was passed unanimously that the
chairman of law and constitution
of the State Federation should
bring the legal status of the women of Tennessee to the notice of
the Federation of clubs, with a
view of seeing if something could
ot be done to improve the mar-
ried woman's position before the
law.
This was done at the convention
which met in Nashville in May,
1909. A resolution was passed that
the president appoint a committee to compile the laws concerning
the women of Tennessee and that
a report be made to the next convention. The president, Mrs. Mc-
Cormick, appointed Mrs. French,
chairman, and left to her the selection of the other members of
the committee. She wrote to each
president of the federated clubs of
the state, asking that she appoint
a member of this committee from
her club. In this way interest
was aroused in the clubs all over
the state and the women began
to study diligently their position
before the law. Many of them
were told by the men of their
family and even by lawyers, of
some reputation in the state, that
it was all a mistake about the
laws of Tennessee not being advantageous to women, and one of
the examples they gave in evidence, was that a married woman
did not have to keep a contract.
These representatives of women
have not the moral sense sufficiently cultivated to recognize the fact
that  such  a law  is  a degradation ...

to the women instead of a protection. Such a law can be nothing
but degrade as it reflects not only
upon the intelligence of women,
but upon her moral sense as well.
We are told that the early fathers of the church at a council
once debated the Question as to
whether a woman had a soul.  It
seems the lawmakers of Tennessee decided this point in the negative. This matter of the legal
status of the women of Tennessee
was reported upon by Mrs. French
at the convention in Chattanooga
in 1910, and at the convention at
Memphis by Mrs. Turney, of Nashville, in 1911, and by the president
of the Federation in Sewanee in
1912 when she made it the subject of her annual address. No
one subject has received more
attention from the State Federation than this. The matter has
been brought twice to the attention of the Tennessee Bar association, and both times a motion was
passed that changes should be
made in our laws removing the
disabilities of married women. One
or more bills have been introduced into the present legislature in
compliance with this sentiment
and it is hoped there will be
enough statesmenship in that body
to perceive the right thing and
to do it.
Reports from the capital say
that the judiciary committee after
a heated discussion, have decided
to report favorably on the removal
of  married  women's  disabilities.
Some of the friends of equal
suffrage say it is not good policy
to work for a change in our antiquated laws, as they are such
good evidence of the futility of
having women represented by men,
with the hope of getting full justice for the women. Bad men do
not care for justice and good ones
are too much engaged with trying
to get justice for themselves and
families to spend time looking after the rights of women in general.
Good men take care of their
own families and naturally find
this occupies most of their time
and intelligence. Who can blame
them, if they forget the fact that
they are the political representatives of all women who are disfranchised?
Republican governments were
established because wise men
found out all classes must be put
in a position to defend their own
rights otherwise gross injustice
would be done to many. Women
have been so long considered only as appendages to men, that
many, not very intelligent people,
find it difficult to readjust their
thought and give women place as
individual units.
The question we now await with
interest is, will our Tennessee
representatives now in session,  be
equal   to  the occasion?

<dc:description>National Suffrage Parade, Will
Be Remarkable Demonstration
Preparations are proceeding apace for
the  national  suffrage     parade    to  take
place in Washington on March 3, the
day before President Wilson's inauguration.
There have beeen many equal suffrage demonstrations in America, but
this will probably excel all others in
size, significance and picturesque features. Early in January, the national
association opened headquarters on &quot;F&quot;
street, less than a block from the treasury, and manned its offices, with a competent force, under the direction of Miss
Alice Paul, chairman of the congres-
sional committee, which committee is
working in conjunction with a com-
mittee from the various societies of the District of Columbia.  The informal opening
of these quarters was the occasion
 of an enthusiastic house warming
when   photographers,  reporters and
writers,  to   say   nothing   of the public
in  general,  flocked   to  the  scene
and   hundreds  seeking     admission   were
turned away for want of room.
This parade has been a chief, topic
interest in Washington lately, because of
the agitation   precipitated   by  the   wom-
en's request   for   permission   to   march over
the  route  followed   by   all processions
sincethe days of Jefferson.    The chief of
 police advised the women to be content
with  a   side  street.     This  sug-
gestion was declined with thanks, where-
upon a lively    discussion    between     the women
and   various   high   officials   followed.
The Washington Press took up
the   matter   and in
spirited   editorials, advocated  justice to
the women.    Presi-
dent Taft also put in a good word for
them by saying they have as much right
to the route in question as the men, and
various senators and congressmen took
a divided stand in the matter. The result was a permit for full possession of
tins historic highway from 2 p.m. to
6 p. m.  on  March 3rd.
The  line of  march, therefore,  will be
from   the Peace  monument  at  the foot
of  the  capitol,  to  the white house
on  to Continental  Memorial hail, where a 
rally   will  he held.     Through the influence
of Senator Bacon and   Speaker Champ Clark, permission has been se-
cured for  the use  of   the Plaza, facing (missing) monument, and the steps of the Treasury building, for the formation and  (missing) tableaux that are to be presented-- (missing)
the way, 
will   be   a (missing)
from     the  clouds of a    &quot;winged (missing),&quot;
presumably from Mars, bearing a 
message to ''Miss Columbia,&quot; the cen-(missing)
figure of a scene that will be staged [on] the
steps of the treasury department.
Needless to say, an aviatress, Miss Beretta  
Miller, and her machine, will be the 
agents  in tins mysterious  visitation.
The management of  Has pageant   has
been placed  in the  hands  of profession-
als Mrs. Glenna Tinnin and Miss 
Hazel  (missing)
who  are well    known  organ- (missing)
...raiiners..    It  is their  purpose (missing)

and   a   woman   standing  side   by [si]de   and   hand   in   hand   will   represent
the equal  suffrage states, and these actors  will  all  occupy   a  large car   appro-

and making a circle about this car, w[ill]
be the  &quot;lone  lorn  women&quot;  of  the non
suffrage states, each woman bound and
handicapped by the chains   of some obsolete  social custom or unjust law.    The
motif of the whole scheme, of course, is
&quot;Votes   for   Women,&quot;   and -wherever   it
is possible to pin  an argument,  point a
moral, or proclaim a sermon, there they
will be pinned,  pointed  and proclaimed,
[wi]th  the hope that they will carry con-(missing)
tion to the
multitudes  that,  shall  as-
[semble] in Washington during inaugural
week. In short, this pageant is to be in the
[na]ture of a new crusade,  combining much of 
the color, fervor and dramatic interest
of the  old  order  with   the   tri-
umphal  enblems  of  justice,  truth   and
progress, vhich belong, to the new order.     </dc:description>

<dc:description>MUNICIPAL SUFFRAGE   No. 3. What the women might, could,
would, or should do, to make Knoxville a
better place in which to live, if they had
the ballot and one of the commissioners
was a woman to look after our municipal
housekeeping.
'Women are specially fitted to superintend the cleaning and beautifying of
cities. Their delicate physical organization, greatly increased by an indoor life,
and the length of their garments make
them   observant     of     the   conditions   of
streets   and   public   buildings.
Knoxville is now paying good salaries
to five commissioners to devote their
whole time to the management of the
city   affairs.
In two previous numbers of this series
of articles on municipal housekeeping,
the failure of officials to enforce the
smoke ordinance and the selling of intoxicants and to remove obscene pictures
was commented upon. Let us look now
at the condition of our streets.
In the last few years our citizens have
gone to much expense to improve our
streets and sidewalks. This has made
our city most attractive in appearance,
to the general observer, but when one
looks closely and critically into conditions one finds because of neglect of
little things, much discomfort is expe-
ienced by those who   have   paid   large
[sums] for making our streets what they should be.
Let us take one small section and see what its condition is on a rainy day.
We will start from the university and come down Cumberland avenue.  We find no sidewalk on one side of the street and on the other while there is an inferior sidewalk part of the way, there is a crossing which is utterly impossible for ladies to use in bad weather.  The street is full of mud holes, which might be filled at a small cost if it were anybody's business to attend to such things.    Coming on up Cumberland we find a soft drink stand for negroes. Nothing
need be said as to its character as every
one knows the character of all the so-
called  &quot;soft drink stands.&quot;  ..... scattered all over the sidewalks vnder
the L. &amp; N. bridges. Why should this
rich road be required to clean up these
unsightly  places?
We now come to the paved street,
which though it has a very steep grade
is paved with asphalt. The humane
society should certainly put in a protest against streets with steep grades being paved with asphalt. It is with the
greatest difficulty that horses with heavy
loads can pull up this street and in rainy
weather and when ice is on the street
it is almost impassable for vehicles.
Some one should see that no more steep
grades in Knoxville are paved with such
materials.
Continuing up Cumberland we come
to two driveways where during a rain
the water runs down them and over the
pavement, causing passers-by to have to
walk in water or take to the road. Or
if we turn up Henly (sic.) street we find an
alley with a very steep grade, where the
water flows, during a rain, in a constant stream over the sidewalk, as those
whose business it was to look after the
matter allowed ine drain to be put on
the outside of the sidewalk instead of
the inside. Many of the downspouts in
this neighborhood are allowed to dis-
charge their water on the surface instead of its being conducted underground
to the gutters,
where  the  water   would
keep the gutters clean.    Because
of running on surface the water pours
over pavements during a hard rain and
is most uncomfortable for pedestrians.
All these are comparatively small matters, but how much discomfort they oc-
casion our   citizens   and   then they are totally
unnecessary. They show
the need of more judicious  municipal  housekeeping.
Give a woman the job to look after these small affairs and see if there will not be some improvement.                                                                         L. CROZIER FRENCH</dc:description>

<dc:description>EQUAL SUFFRAGE DEPARTMENT
Editors:—Mrs. Julia Lucky,  President of Equal Suffrage league, and
Mrs. Sara H. Hood, Secretary.
KNOXVILLE   OFFICERS.
President—-Mrs,   C.   E.   Lucky.
Vice-President—Miss Ada Fanz.
Corresponding Secretary—Miss Margaret Craft
Recording Secretary—Mrs. M. K. Purnell
Treasurer—Miss Mary Trigg Jackson.
Mrs. L. Crozier French has been invited by Mrs. John I. Cox and other
ladies of Bristol to give a lecture at
that place Wednesday evening, March
12, on the woman question.
A number of the members of the
Knoxville Equal Suffrage league went
to Washington to be in the suffrage parade. We are anxious to hear how they
fared at the hands of the hoodlums.
Both of the editors of this department are now absent from the city.
Mrs. Lucky is in Florida and Mrs. Hood
went to Washington to help represent
Tennessee in the equal suffrage parade.
Mrs.   French   will   give   a tea to   the
Knoxville Equal   Suffrage league   and their friendds Monday from four to six.  Thise members who went to Washington will be the guests if honor and will tell of the suffrage parade.  All friends of equal suffrage are incited (sic.) to come to the tea. Gentlemen friends will be most cordially welcome.

Mrs. L. Crozier French is an applicant for the position of juvenile judge for Knox County. A number of letters
have  been  written  bo  Governor  Hooper
asking him to appoint her.    The representatives from Knox county have been
requested,   by   a   number   of   prominent
citizens, to introduce     a     bill     making
women eligible to the position.
The Tennessee Mothers' congress holds
the annual convention in Nashville
March. 28 and 29.  Mrs. Robertson is anxious that every mother's association in Knoxville should send it full quota of delegates.  This assocaition has two bills before the present legislature, the mothers' pension bill and a billrequiring all schools to have a kindergarten as a part of of educational system.
There is  talk   of   a   bill   being   introduced to 
niake   women   eligible   to   be members of
 boards of  education.     Not
until 1907 were women forbidden to be
members  of school boards.  It seems 
strange, that when the western and eastern states
were  putting  women  in  important places
 in their schools,  Tennessee should take
  backward   st......
...longer, slower and more toilsome  than
the direct way.
It cost hundreds of New York teachers
six years of arduous work to secure an
equal pay law; and the law applies
only to one city in the state. After
equal suffrage was granted in Wyoming
and Utah, state-wide laws were passed,
without effort on the teacher's part,
providing that when the women teachers
did equal work they should get equal 
pay (Revised Statutes of Wyoming, Section
614(?); revised Statutes of Utah, Section;)   and   the   same   rule   prevails   by 
custom in the other enfranchised states.
The New York antis, constantly threw 
cold water upon the effort of the teach- 
ers for equal pay until after it had suceeded
now turn around and point to
the law as proof that women can perfectly well get anything they want without a vote. But what is the comparative
cost in time and labor?
It took Massachusetts women 55 years
to get an equal guardianship law. In
Colorado the first legislature after women were enfranchised granted it. Mrs.
A. J. George, of Massachusetts, in her
recent lectures in Michigan and other
states against equal suffrage, has been
boasting of good laws of Massachusetts,
including equal guardianship. She omits
to mention, that for six years the &quot;Massachusetts Association...(missing) Further extension of suffrage (missing) en&quot; of which she is a member. (missing) under its official imprint a (missing)
opposition  to equal guardianship
boasts of the equitable property laws of 
Massachusetts, but does not mention 
that they are the fruit of more than half 
a century's effort by the suffragists, with the antis all the time declaring that the
laws were &quot;more than just, to women,.&quot;
that women already had &quot;all the rights
they wanted,&quot; etc.. etc.
What a vast amount of time and toil
hundreds of women have had to put in
&quot;haggling with prejudice  for penny
worths&quot; of reform which they could have
secured without a twentieth part of the
exertion if they could have had had
''the little mechanism of the ballot,&quot; as
Jane Addams call it!
What a vast amount of time and toil
women have had  to put  in just to get
that little  mechanism!    What a saving
of time it will be to the century's very
best   women   when   they   get   it   and   no
longer  have  to   struggle for   it!     Even
the near approach of equal suffrage has
begun to save  women's time.     In   New
York and Pennsylvania this year it was 
not thought necessary to have the legis- 
lative   hearings   which   heretofore   have
consumed  so much time and energy of
suffragists and  antis alike. Why?    Be
cause all parties had put suffrage planks
into their platforms.    When every state
has  adopted  equal  suffrage women can
put into direct work for the public good
all the force  that they now have to expend
 in getting the tool to work  with;
and the saving will be beyond computa-
tion.-

<dc:description>CONGRESSMAN
AUSTIN'S REPLY
To Resolution Regarding Passage of Susan B. Anthony
Federal Amendment.
On March 28 a Knox county committee
was formed to work with the Woman's
party for the passage of the Susan B. Anthony federal  amendment.
A resolution was passed and copies ordered sent to President Wilson and the
Tennessee congressmen.  A reply has been
received from Representative Austin, which
is here published with the resolution.
RESAOLUTION (sic.)
Whereas, the international situation is
in such a disturbed condition that none can
predict what a day may bring forth, and
it is not improbable that war may shortly
be declared between the United States and
Germany;
Therefore, be it resolved, that it is the
sense of this meeting that because in the
event of war the women of this country
equally with the men will be called upon
to carry their share of the burdens thereof,
that now is the time for congress to take
the first step toward the recognition by
the government of this republic of the citizenship of women by the passage of the
federal amendment looking to the removal
of the political disabilities of the women
of the whole Union.
The patriotism of the women of the
United States is assured, but the pleasure
of their patriotic acts will be greatly enhanced by the knowledge that the government recognizes their right to full citizenship.
We most earnestly petition the President
and congress to do all in their power to obtain justice for women before calling upon
them to perform extra duties.
Be it further resolved that a copy of
these resolutions be sent to the President
and each member of congress from Tennessee.
Mr.   Austin's reply is as follows:
Washington, D. C, April 3, 1917.
Mrs.   L.   Crozier  French,
Knoxville,   Tenn.
Dear Mrs. French: I beg to acknowledge
receipt of the copy of the resolutions
passed at a meeting of a Knox county committee of the Tennessee branch of the National Women's party, on March 28, for
which   please   accept   my   thanks.
I trust that those who control the organization of the house will give us an
opportunity to vote on the amendment to
the constitution. I am transmitting your
letter to Mr. Kitchin, leader of the majority, with the suggestion that the committee
having this legislation in charge report out
the amendment for the consideration of the
house,  etc.
With great respect, I am
Sincerely,
R.   W.   AUSTIN.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WANT REPRESENTATION
ON SCHOOL BOARDS
Knoxville   Suffragists   Have   Started
the Movement In State.
Mrs. Margaret Carson, of Knoxville, is
at present in Chattanooga in the interest
of the series of lectures to be given by
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president of the
Tennessee Equal Suffrage association, on
parliamentary law and laws governing
women and children in this state. Mrs.
French will address the various clubs in
this city during the latter part of October or first of November.
According to Mrs. Carson, the people
of Knoxville are very much interested in
the convention of state suffragists which
will be held in that city late in October.
The suffragists of that city are planning
to entertain the delegates during the two
days session and a number of social features are included.
The suffragists of Knoxville have started a movement to allow a due proportion
of the women in this state to be made
a constituent part of all school boards,
both county and city. Resolutions have
been adopted to this effect and a committee appointed to push the matter.
When asked about the unpleasantness
said to exist in the ranks of the Chattanooga suffragists over the election of Mrs.
L. Crozier French to the office of state
president on the resignation of Miss
Sarah Barnwell Elliott, Mrs. Carson
called attention to a section of the bylaws which states that the executive committee may fill any vacancies occurring
in the interim of the annual meeting.
Mrs. French was elected at a meeting
of the committee when Mrs. McCormick.
of Memphis, who is vice-president of the
state association,  was presiding.
Chattanooga suffragists claimed that
Mis French's election was not in accord-
ance with parliamentary ruling and was
therefore illegal. The local members of
the cause have so far refused to recognize
Mrs. French as the state leader.
Mrs. Carson will leave Chattanooga
tonight for Athens, where she will confer
with a number of clubwomen regarding
the organization of a suffrage league.
Mrs. French will lecture on &quot;Suffrage&quot;
before the Browning circle at Athens at
an early date.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ex-Gov. Patterson Asked For
Suffrage Views By Mrs. French.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president of
the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league
and one of the pioneer workers for
suffrage in the state of Tennessee,
never lets pass an opportunity to work
for the cause. Since first embracing
the movement Mrs. French has done
much active work and the Equal Suffrage league, under her direction, is
planning an active campaign for the
coming year.
The following telegram has been
sent to Gov. M. R. Patterson at Nash
ville, and local members are awaiting
with  interest  his  answer:
&quot;Gov.    M.    R.     Patterson,     Nashville,
Tenn.
&quot;We are surprised that you failed
to declare in favor of woman's suffrage, in your Nashville address. Will
you favor us with a declaration as
to whether you approve or disapprove
vote for women?
&quot;MRS.   L.    C.   FRENCH,
&quot;President  Knoxville   Equal   Suffrage
League.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>BENEFIT CARD
IS BEING ARRANGED
Money Will be Used to Entertain Suffrage Convention
Delegates.
A large number of representative
women   of   the   city   met   with   Mrs.   L.
Crozier-French Saturday morning in the
parlors of the board cf commerce, when
plans were discussed for the entertainment of delegates who will attend the
convention of the State Equal Suffrage
association, which is to convene in
Knoxville the last week in October.
The ladies rallied to the call extended
by Mrs. French in gratifying numbers,
and showed much interest in the convention. 
It was decided to give a benefit card
party for the purpose of raising funds
for the entertainment of delegates. This
affair will be given on the afternoon of
October   8th,   at   the   Lyceum  building.
About a week after this affair, another entertainment will be given for the
same purpose. Details for this have not
been settled upon, and its nature will not
be disclosed until later.
At the meeting Saturday morning,
there was general discussion held on
how to entertain the guests of the convention.</dc:description>

<dc:description>MEETING OF CLUB
WOMEN IS CALLED
Plans Will Be Made to Entertain State Convention.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president of
the Tennessee Equal Suffrage league,
has called a meeting of all representative women of this city to be held this
morning in the board of commerce parlors,   at   ten   o'clock.
This meeting is for the purpose of
discussing ways and means for Knox-
ville's entertainment of the Tennessee
Suffrage association, which convenes in
this   city   October  27,   28   and   29.
Attending this convention will be a
number of the most prominent and influential women of the state, socially
and in club work, and the gathering will
also be attended by notable suffrage
workers from eact (sic.) and west. The personnel of the convention will be quite
distinguished, and Knoxville women
must, if they are to make this gathering what it has been in other cities,
be  up  and doing,  say local leaders.
Not  only   will  members   of   the   local 
suffrage   league   be   interested   in   these
visitors,   but  every   club  woman  of  the 
city,   every  woman   prominent  in  social
circles, will find that the guestlist of this 
convention includes     names  of    women 
whom she would gladly entertain in one
way   or   another.
Mrs. French, a representative of one 
of the oldest and best families of this 
city, feels that Knoxville women will 
be glad to uphold the city's reputation
for hospitality in connection with this 
convention.
Mrs.   French   will  be   pleased   to   see 
this morning all Knoxville women who 
are  interested.    The     meeting     will  be
held  promptly  at  ten   o'clock&quot;  and  will 
be  brief.

<dc:description>Tennessee Awake.
Even Tennessee legislators have been
aroused and our old,  barbarous laws ate
at last about  to  be  cancelled.
We mav hope that soon the wife will
be allowed to manage her own property.
That the widow will inherit the sums
as the widower, that the mother will be
made an equal guardian with the father
of their children;that women will be
recognized as an influence in our school
system, so they may give their best help
to remove the blot of illiteracy that so
mars our reputation as a progressive
common wealth.
It  certainly will not   be   long   before
the men   of  Tennessee   will   realize   that
in  depriving the daughters of our  state
of  their  right   to participate  in   the  affairs of government  which    they       are
taxed to support, they are robbing them
of rights guaranteed by   the constitution
of the United  States.
The   dead   have   been   awakened—shall
I sleep ?
The  world's  at war     with     tyrants—
shall I crouch?
The harvest's ripe—and shall I pause to
reap?
I  slumber not—the  thorn  is    in    my
  couch.
Each day a  trumpet soundeth   in    my
ear.
It's echo's  in  my  heart.
—BYRON.
— L. CROZIER FRENCH.</dc:description>

<dc:description>John P. Davis' Letter.
The   following   letter   to   Mrs.
French   from   the  Hon.   John  P.   Davis,
former   state   senator,   contains  matter,
which, coining from, a lawyer, is of supreme   interest,   and  compels   our   eager
attention:
Tazewell,  Tenm.   Sept.  20.   1916.
Mrs. L. C. French, Knoxville. Tenn.,
Dear Madam:—In my letter to you of
October 27, 1913, on the subject of women suffrage, I said to you. &quot;If a constitutional convention should be held in the
near future, women would be granted
the full rights of citizenship. Very few,
except whiskey men, would oppose such
a change in the constitution,&quot;
Since that letter was written to you,
both of the great political parties of
the state have adopted platforms favoring women suffrage. If the convention had been called at the last August
election, without doubt my prediction
would have been verified: but a constitutional convention is not necessary.
Without a constitutional convention,
women have been enfranchised to the
extent that they can hold the offices of
notary public, county superintendent of
schools, other school offices, etc. The legislature can give women the right to
vote, just as easily as it has given them
the right to hold offices. All that is needed is a legislature willing to do this. If
the women of the state desire a law
passed giving them a right to vote, along
with  other political privileges, they
should organize for the purpose of seeing that men are elected to the senate
and house who are pledged to vote for
their   enfranchisement.
If a republican should refuse to pledge
himself to work and vote for a law of
this kind, then he is not supporting the
republican party, is not a good republican, and no republican is under obligations to vote for him. If the democratic
candidate for the house or senate refuses to pledge himself in the same way,
then he is not a good democrat, and no
democrat is under obligations to support
him. A man with sufficient intelligence
and sufficient sense of justice to be
qualified to act as a member of either
the house or the senate will be positively
in favor of giving to women the right
to vote, or he will be indifferent on the
subject. There are enough legislative
districts where the vote will be close to
enable the women of the state to elect
a majority, of the members, by throwing
their combined influence in favor of the
candidate who will vote for their cause.
A well organized effort on the part of the
suffrage movement can give to the women of this state the right to vote before
next March. There is still plenty of
time for the leaders of the suffrage 
movement to effect this organization, and 
to bring about this result; but there is 
no time to waste. We need not hope 
for a constitutional convenion during our
lives: but the ends we have in view can
be obtained without a constitution convention.
Have candidates to give written pledges. Have them to agree to have local
bills passed, giving to the women of their
own counties the right to vote, if it
shall appear impossible to get a general
law passed. The first law authorizing
the election of a woman as notary public
was a local law, passed at the request
Senator Holliday and myself, in 1911,
and applying to Claiborne county and to
Putnam county. As the country did not
seem to suffer any great injury from this
law, a general law ,applying to the whole
state,  has been enacted.
Truly  yours.
JNO.   P.   DAVIS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN TO HELP
IN RATIFICATION
Support of Measure at Legislature's Special Session Pledged
at Mass Meeting.
SITUATION RE VIEWED
Miss Anita L. Pollitzer of Washington and Mrs. L. C. French
Make Addresses.
Miss Anita L. Pollitzer, legislative
secretary of the national woman's
party, with headquarters at Washington, who is in the city in the interests of the ratification by Tennessee of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment to the federal constitution, and Mrs. L.. C. French, addressed a mass meeting of men and
women held at the Woman's building
this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
Ratification by Tennessee as the
necessary thirty-sixth state, was the
main topic of discussion during the
afternoon, the situation being reviewed  in  all  details.
The situation in other states was
reviewed also.
&quot;In Oklahoma an attempt was
made to put through a referendum,&quot;
she explained. &quot;In New Mexico a
plot to gain native votes was discovered and thwarted just in time to
save the situation. In West Virginia the anti-suffrage forces brought
back a senator who had previously
resigned his seat in a written letter
to the governor, and had taken up
permanent residence in another state.
All this shows that in the states
where    ratification    was    apparently most certain, it took the concentrated efforts  of every man  and woman in the state to show a suffrage victory.&quot;                                                                                                                                                     Outline   Both   Party   Records
Miss   Pollitzer   then   outlined     the  
contribution of the democratic and republlcan parties on the question of ratification. She showed that the republican parties on the question aware  and  the   refusal   of  the  gov-
ernors of Vermont and Connecticut
to call special sessions of the legislatures of their states had made the
chances of the women voting in the
coming election very slight. &quot;&quot;Then
came   the   decision   of     the     United States   supreme   court   in   the   Ohio case, and the decision of the assist-   
ant attorney-general of the United States and the attorney general of Tennesse hat Tennessee could ratify,she stated.     She then read the correspondence between Assistant 
Attorney-General Frierson and Pres- 
iden Wilson on the Ohio case.
As one of the committee from the
National Woman's Party which interviewed Gov. Cox and Senator Warren G. Harding, Miss Pollitzer told
several interesting incidents of the
visits to Columbus   and Marion.
She read telegrams received today

from Miss Alice Paul, national chairman of the Woman's party, who reported that the Harding-Coolidge
League of the District of Columbia
had stated it considered the unanimous vote by the republican members
of the Tennessee legislature of the
first importance.
Miss Paul also stated that the democratic leaders are equally active.
Mrs. French Speaks.
Mrs. L. C. French was selected by
Miss Sue White, a former Tennes-
sean, but a resident of Washington
for several years, to represent Tennessee in the delegation chosen to
interview Gov. Cox and Senator Harding regarding their views on the ratification of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment by Tennessee. Miss White
is secretary of the Woman's party,
being closely associated with Miss
Paul, who heads the organization.
After a brief sketch of the interviews with Gov. Cox and Senator
Harding, Mrs. French spoke of the
provision in the Tennessee constitution which seems to create an impression on some  minds that    action   by
  the   present   legislature   on   the   pro-
posed amendment would not be legal.
      She mentioned the fact that a prom-
inent lawyer of the state had told her,
 almost a year ago, that that clause
in Tennessee's constitution would not
hold good because no state constitu-
tion had any right to make conditions
for    the    ratification    of    a   federal
amendment.
Mrs. French stated that she had
written a communication to a republican paper in answer to an editorial
in that paper, cautioning republican
members of the legislature to consult
their individual    consciences    as    to
whether they could vote for ratifica-
 tlon. The Paper, she said, did not
 publish the communication, although
 the editor had promised to do so. 
Mrs. French gave    as her    opinion that the republicans were in no sense
under any obligation to strain a point
to uphold a clause put in the Tennessee constitution by partisan democrats in 1870 because of the passage of the fourteen ta amendment.
The democrats of the south thought
that by such means they might con-
trol further radical action by the re-
publican (missing)

<dc:description>TENNESSEE CLUB WOMEN TO
FURNISH PARTY HOME ROOM
Compartment To Be Named In Honor Of
Mrs, L, C. French.
Club women of Tennessee are to
be given an opportunity to assist in
furnishing- the Tennessee room in
the newly purchased home of the
Woman's Party in Washington, D.
C. Mrs. S. L. Branch, of Knoxville,
state chairman of the Woman's
Party for Tennessee is perfecting
her organization in various parts of
the state, appointing chairmen and
delegating certain duties to differ-
ent clubs. Ossoli Circle, being the
oldest woman's club in the South,
has been given the lead in furnishing this room.
The building as described by Mrs.
Branch, who recently turned from
Washington, is beautiful. It was
purchased by Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont and given to the Woman's
Party as a national home. The
building is on Capitol Hill and was
used as the United States capitol
in 1912 when the capitol was destroyed by fire. It was from one of
the balconies of this mansion that
President Monroe gave his inaugural
address.
Mrs. Branch was told that some
states were being given the privilege of furnishing a room in this
building which could be used by
women of those states when visiting
Washington. As Tennessee was the
thirty-sixth, and the decisive, state to
ratify the nineteenth amendment to
the   constitution   granting   suffrage
to women, it was considered especially fitting that Tennessee should have
a room. Mrs. Florence Bayard Hil-
les, of Delaware, chairman of the
house furnishing committee, ap-
pointed Mrs. Branch as state chairman for Tennessee.
On suggestion of Miss Sue White
of Jackson, Tenn., it has been decided to dedicate the Tennessee
room to Mrs. L. C. French because
of her work in the interest of
women.
Every efort (sic.) will be made, according to Mrs. Branch, to secure furniture of colonial design and authentic
history. The history of each piece
will be written on a placard and
placed near so that visitors can
read it at a glance. In addition to
the history of the gift the placard
will bear the name of the donor.
As it now stands the room requires much preliminary work before it is in condition for furniture.
It will be necessary to scrape paint
and repaper walls, work that is estimated to cost about $200. The woodwork is said to be unusually beautiful, being of an inlaid design of
mahogany, bird's eye maple, and
walnut.
Ossoli Circle is to appoint a committee in the near future to solicit
contributions for both money and
furniture throughout East Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WITH 71 CANDLES ON BIRTHDAY
CAKE MRS. L CROZIER FRENCH
REMINISCENCES ON THE PAST
A birthday cake with seventy-one
candles! That is what will be displayed today at the dinner to be given
in honor of the seventy-first birthday
of Mrs. Lucy Crozier French. Seventy-one years old—and yet as youthful in manner and as vigorous in
mind and body as though she were
many years younger, Mrs. French is
today one of the most interesting personages of Knoxville. Her memory is
richly stored With treasures of the
city's history. And her's has been no
mean part in making Knoxville history.
Born on the site where stands the
present building of The Knoxville
Sentinel, Mrs. French remembers the
time when Main street was the great
business district of Knoxville and Gay
its best residential section. When
she was two years old her father purchased the house where today towers
the Farragut Hotel.  The old house
had been built by Mr. Hazen, and Mr.
Crozier bought it from Mr. Niles.
The residence was surrounded by a
fine lawn, bordered with sugar maple
trees, and here many a band of soldiers resting in Knoxville while en
route to Virginia during the Civil war
would lie down in the cool shadows
of the trees to sleep.
Had To Move Twice.
Mr. Crozier was a prominent Secessionist, and when Nashville fell, believing that East Tennessee would
succumb next to the triumphant arms
of the north, he moved his family to
Atlanta. But after a six months stay
there, the Crozier returned to Knoxville, where they remained until the
approach of General Burnside's army
made the fate of Knoxville uncertain,
when they took refuge in southwest
Virginia, at a town then known as
Liberty, and now called Bedford City.
It was two years after the war be-
fore they dared return in peace to
Knoxville where they now made their
permanent home.
Here in the gay period succeeding
the war, Lucy Crozier made her debut
into society, after completing her education at the Convent of Visitation at
Georgetown. Knoxville had never enjoyed so gay a time as during these
years, when the town was full of
young soldiers just returned from the
war, and every girl had more beaus
than she quite knew what to do with.
It was an informal society, with not
much money, but there was an abundance of fun and good spirits. So
numerous were the young men that
the rule was made that at a dance no
one could make an engagement for a
dance until the preceding one had
been called. This was to give an opportunity to the newcomers in the
town who wished to enjoy the company of the girls, and were apt to be
crowded out by the boys who had long
resided in Knoxville.
Played In Dramatics.
A weekly dance was given by the
Young Men's Dancing club at the old
Union Bank   which stood opposite Ed
McMillan's present    home    on    Main,
street.      Mr.    Hodgson,     brother    of
Frances Hodgson Burnett, a musical
genius   of  note,  and  organist  at  the
First Presbyterian church played the
 piano  in  the  band,  and  gave to  the
young people such music as has seldom been  enjoyed  since.    Mrs. Burnett was frequently    seen    at    these
weekly entertainments.    At one time
she played the comedy woman's part
in   &quot;She   Stoops   To   Conquer,&quot;   when
Mrs. French acted the leading role as
Miss Hardcastle.    So gifted was Mrs.
Burnett on   the  stage  that  many  of
her friends believed that had she not
devoted herself to literature she might
easily have attained fame as an actress.
At the age of twenty-one, just fifty
years ago today, Lucy Crozier became
the bride of W. B. French. The two
had grown up together, and after a
separation during the war, the old
acquaintanceship blossomed into romance. At that time Mr. French was
cashier at Cowan McClung's but later became the first cashier of the
East Tennessee Bank.
Only a few months after the marriage, Mrs. French was left a widow
by the sudden death of her husband.
Left to face the world at a time when 
most young girls are just beginning to
enjoy life, she went heroically to work
to forget her sorrow. In company
with her sister, she founded a school
called the The Knoxville Female Institute, and here some of the boys
and girls from the best families in
Knoxville received the foundations of
a good education. The school was es-
tablished in September and in November Mrs. French organized Ossoli
Society, now the leading woman's
club of the city.
Became Leader of Women.
At a time when women were not
supposed to take a great interest in 
any activities save those of home and
society, Mrs.. French became a leader
among women. She founded the Woman's Industrial Union and through
it got the city to established the office of police matron,. Later through
this same organization, she persuaded
the county to establish the Knox
County Industrial School, but it was
not until the efficiency of women in
social service was acknowledged, and
they were given a place on the board
that this institution became of real
value to the people it was intended to
serve.
The first kindergarten in Knoxville
also owed its beginning to Mrs.
French who pointed out the need for
such a work to the King's Daughters.
She also was a member of the board
 that helped to establish the first hospital in Knoxville.
Among the various capacities in
which Mrs. French has served the
women of Knoxville and Tennessee
are those as president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage League, when she
organized in 1910 the first suffrage
league in the state in Knoxville; as
state vice-president of the Parent-
Teachers' Association; as president of
the Tennessee Federation of Woman's
Clubs, and today as parliamentarian
for the same federation.
Although so prominent in city and
state affairs, Mrs. French has always
been a devoted home woman, and is
very proud of her tall son, who has
returned from his home in Birmingham to celebrate his mother's seventy-first birthday, and the fiftieth anniversary of her marriage. She is also a devoted grandmother to the two
stalwart children of her son. Capable and charming, Mrs. French is a
woman of whom Knoxville may well
be proud. Indeed we may say with
assurance that Knoxville extends to
Mrs. French heartiest congratulations
and good wishes on this happy occasions. May there be many returns of
the day!'</dc:description>

<dc:description>TRIBUTE  IS PAID
OSSOLI'S LEADER
Surprise Meeting Was Birthday
Party For Mrs. Lucy
Crozier French
Ossoli circle's surprise program for
its regular meeting Monday afternoon,
was one of the most delightful of the
year. It was converted into a birthday
party in honor of the distinguished president, Mrs. L. Crozier French and as
such was enjoyed by nearly two hundred
prominent women of the city who had
been bidden to attend. 
The idea of this celebration originated
with Mrs;. Walter S. Nash, &quot;who with
Mesdames W. C. Baker and William G.
Smythe were hostesses. Receiving with
them were Mrs. French and the officers
of Ossoli.  About two hundred guests
were present including only the mem-
-bers of the circle. The occasion proved
to be a veritable love feast, all were
seated in two large circles, the president
in the seat of honor.
Mrs. Smythe most graciously welcomed the guests with a short talk.
Birthday greetings and felicitations
were extended to Mrs. French by Mrs.
Nash. Mrs. French responded with a
few delightful remarks, expressing her
appreciation of the honor shown her.
After this the circle expressed their
greetings and congratulations and a social hour followed.
A birthday cake with lighted candles
was presented to the honor guest, the
number of lighted candles were the feature of a guessing contest, four ladies
guessing the correct number, and in
the cut for the prize, Mrs. Albert Sydney Birdsong won the prize, a blue-
back spelling book, was presented by
Mrs.   W.   C.   Baker.
Mrs. R. J. Yearwood was in charge
of the decorations, which were beautiful
and carried out the colors of Ossoli, lavender and white. The floral centerpiece
of the picture table was lavender iris
and white roses, and the silver candelabra burned lavender tapers.
Mrs. George F. Mellen and Mrs.
Charles T. Cates presided at the table
and served the ice and coffee,. Also assisting were Mesdames Inge Murphy,
Frank Fowler, Logan Reid, Archer
Bishop. Churchwell Mabry, and other
members   of   the   social   committee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mrs. L. C. French Dies
In Washington D. C.
Prominent Club Woman And Civic Worker
Succumbs Following Heart Attack,
BY RUSSELL KENT
Journal   Washington  Bureau
WASHINGTON,   May   14  — Mrs
L.  Crozier  French,  for  many  years  
prominent in social and civic activi- 
ties in Knoxville and a pioneer work-   
er   in   Tennessee   for   women's   suf- 
frage, died here at 4 o'clock this  af-
ternoon. She was 75 years old.
The body will be sent to Knoxville
on the Memphis Special early in the
morning, arriving at Knoxville tomorrow night. Funeral services will
be held  Monday  morning.
Mrs. French reached Washington
Monday morning, intending to remain several days. She was walking
with Mrs. L. D. Tyson, wife of the
senator, in a room in the National
Women's Party building here which
has been furnished by the Tennessee Women's Party and is to be dedicated in honor of Mrs. French when
she became suddenly ill Wednesday
afternoon. She was removed to Providence hospital.
A son, William W. French arrived
this morning from Birmingham, Ala.
Mrs. French rallied and it was believed she had started toward recovery when in mid-afternoon she
suffered a relapse which brought the
end quickly.
The cause of death was  ascribed
to   heart   trouble,   complicated by  a congestion  of both  lungs  approaching pneumonia and by other physical ailments.</dc:description>

James V. French, and three nieces. 
Fought for Prohibition
Mrs. Dozier (sic.) French was a potent
force in the successful fight for the
emancipation of women and the
enthronement of prohibition. She
was not only a conspicuous worker
for these causes in Tennessee, but
enjoyed a national reputation as an
energetic, tireless and able advocate of woman's suffrage and prohibition. The incidents surrounding
the death of Mrs. French are of peculiar interest, as they relate to her
public record and the honor that
was being bestowed upon her by
those women with whom she had
been associated in their struggles
for legislative relief.
Mrs. French was one of the foremost women leaders of the coun-
try, and especially in Tennessee. In
the matter of promoting woman
suffrage and prohibition, she had
given her life's efforts in behalf of
these causes. She had gone to
Washington to be present at the
national conference in behalf of
equal rights, the national women's
party and other activities of women.
In consideration of her great service to woman suffrage and the
emancipation of women, the national woman's party had set aside
a room in honor of Mrs. French in
their headquarters building at
Washington, which is an old historic building situated near the
capitol and which was given to the
National Woman's party by Mrs. O
H. P. Belmont, president of that
organization. The building presented
by Mrs. Belmont is valued at $350,
000 and is one of the most interesting buildings in the capitol city,
having at one time been used as the
temporary capitol. This Tennessee
memorial room was to be dedicated
in honor of Mrs. French, and for
the dedication of which she was to
be present during her stay in the
capitol city.
Mrs. French was stopping at the
Capitol Woman's party headquarters, and at her request was assigned to the Tennessee room, during a call by Mrs. L.D. Tyson, upon
Mrs. French's, the purpose of which
call was to discuss the fittings and
furnishing of this Tennessee room,
Mrs. French was suddenly taken
very ill. The Tennessee room is situated on the third floor of the National Woman's party headquarters,
and it is necessary to climb two
flights of stairs to enter the room.
Mrs. Tyson was met in the lobby of
the building by Mrs. French, and 
in Mrs. French's active, vigorous
and energetic way she preceded
Mrs. Tyson up the stairs and into
her room, or the Tennessee room,
the very room which was to be
named for her, and she with great
pride called Mrs. Tyson's attention
to the bronzed name-plate upon the
door which bore the inscription
&quot;Tennessee room,  in honor of Mrs.
L.   Crozier  French,   In  appreciation
of her life work for women.&quot;
Suddenly Stricken
Upon entering the room Mrs.
French remarked to Mrs. Tyson
that she felt badly, in fact was-quite
sick, and the assistance of a physician was immediately called for.
First aid was administered by Mrs. 
Tyson and Miss Ainge, national 
treasurer   of  the   Woman's     party.
Upon advice of physicians she was
removed to the Providence hospital, where she passed away about
4:30 Friday afternoon. Her sudden
death was not expected, in fact, it
was thought by the physicians that
she might live for several days, and
that there was an even chance for her recovery. Her son, W. W.
French, of Birmingham, Ala., was
communicated with almost immediately after her first attack and
left Birmingham Thursday morning. Arriving in Washington at noon
Friday, a few hours before the end.
She was conscious to the end and
her son and those who were with
her Friday afternoon felt encouraged over her condition. She conversed with her son and he left her
a few minutes after 4 o'clock to
send telegrams to relatives, fully
confident that she had a chance for
recovery and that there was no immediate  danger.
The women of Tennessee are un-
dertaking the pleasant duty of furnishing the Tennessee, room, in
memory of Mrs. French and the
room already contains several excellent
historical pieces of furniture, one of which had just arrived
and was given by Mrs. French herself in the name of Miss Sue White,
secretary to Senator K. D. McKel-
lar, and of whose work in behalf of
women, Mrs. French expressed deep
appreciation. The table thus given
originally belonged to the Honorable Hugh Lawson White, of Tennessee.
Senator and Mrs. I.. D, Tyson,
Miss Sue White, Miss Fannie
Cooper and other Tennessee friends,
were untiring  in their efforts to
alleviate the suffering of Mrs.
French, in fact the entire organization of the National Woman's party
were solicitous of her every comfort and today the purple, white and
gold banner of the organization
representing the cause for which
Mrs. French spent her entire life
flies at half mast in front of the
national headquarters of the Woman's  party.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Knoxville Has Witnessed Long Fight
In Politics
By Women For 'Rights'
By MARGARET LIPSCOMBE  
Women at the polls, women in politics—all but those who 
strove for woman suffrage—today take for granted the freedom that a few decades ago was little more than a dream.
And Knoxville has had its share of women suffragists
and political leaders, some of them still active in politics.
Familiar were names of women's first political organizations, the old &quot;Knoxville Equal Suffrage League,&quot; the &quot;Margaret French Suffrage Group,&quot; &quot;National Woman's Party&quot;
and the &quot;Woman's Educational and Industrial Union.&quot;
In the South, since early recon-
struction days after the War Between  the  States,   and  sooner  in
the North, women have clamored
for a voice in government.
But the prim &quot;rebellers&quot; of
that day probably had no visions
of the situation as it has become
today, when women shout side by
side with the men at national
political conventions, assume
charge of campaigns, and when
politicians' &quot;baby-kissing&quot; campaigns are conducted to wheedle
the woman's vote.
A woman in Congress probably
was unthought-of except in wildest hopes of the most ambitious.
*      *      *
Chief complaints  of women in
the fight for their rights were outlined by Margaret M. Craft, an
active suffragist of Knoxville, in
a leaflet she compiled to set forth
the worst of laws unfair to
women.
In her compilation she charged
&quot;laws of Tennessee concerning
women are among the most antiquated and unjust of any of the
states of the Union.&quot;
Listed were a law giving
fathers the privilege &quot;to deed or
will away a child, even though
unborn, at the time of his death,
without the consent of the mother,&quot;
and laws making &quot;absolutely dependent the position of the wife,
owing to the possession by the
husband immediately upon marriage of all money and personal
property of both, whether acquired before marriage or after.&quot;
Among the early women leaders were Mrs. L. Crozier French,
Mrs. C. E. Lucky, Mrs. Sara
Henry Hood, Miss Margaret M.
Craft, Mrs. N. K. Cooper, Miss
Ada Fanz, and Mrs. Joel Tyler.
Mrs. French, who died July 16,
1926, was most active of the early
feminine leaders in Knoxville,
and she was known &quot;not only in
Tennessee, but nationally, as an
energetic, tireless and able advocate of woman's suffrage and prohibition&quot; according to an account
of her activities published in The
Knoxville Journal at the time of
her death.
She has been described as &quot;the
most potent force in the successful
fight for emancipation of women
and enthronement of prohibition.&quot;
*     *     *
Mrs. French is the founder of
Ossoli Circle (1885), the Knoxville Equal Suffrage League (organized Jan. 1, 1910), was president Of the Tennessee Federation
of Women's Clubs, founded the
Woman's Educational and Industrial Union (1896), was a delegate
to the first General Federation of
Women's Clubs convention in Atlantic City, and was editor of &quot;The
People,&quot; a short-lived publication
advocating women's rights.
She was the daughter of U. S.
Congressman John H. Crozier,
and the wife of the great-grandson
of the founder of Knoxville, Col.
James White.
The National Woman's Party
had set aside a room in her honor
at their headquarter's building in
Washington.
The Knoxville Equal Suffrage
League was organized with 30
members by Mrs. French, &quot;for ad-
I vocation of the educational, industrial, legal and political rights of
women.&quot;
Mrs.   French  resigned  soon  as
MRS. SARA H.W©OD
president because of duties as
president of the Tennessee Federation of Women's Clubs. Mrs.
Cornelius Lucky was the second
president. Other first officers
were Mrs. Sara Henry Hood, vice-
president; Miss Margaret M. Craft,
corresponding secretary; Mrs.
N. K. Cooper, recording secretary,
and Miss Ada Fanz; treasurer.
*      *      *
Woman suffragists in 1911 set
forth as reasons for demanding a
voice in the government &quot;(1) the
large number of women owning
valuable property and paying
taxes thereon, (2) the increasing
number of workers in all branches
of business, especially in educational departments—all vitally interested in legislation, (3) all
women are equally interested with
men in good government, since
they as well as men suffer from
bad government, and (4) women
are citizens in a democracy.&quot;
&quot;During our fight for. suffrage,
editorial pages of The Knoxville
Journal were always open to us
when Capt. William Rule was editor,&quot; Miss Fanz said. The old
&quot;Sentinel,&quot; with Wiley L. Morgan
as editor, also sympathized with
the suffragists, Miss Fanz said.
After women were given equal
suffrage, in August, 1920, the
League of Women Voters was organized in Nashville with a branch
in Knoxville, of which Mrs. Robert L. Cunningham was a leader.
The league was founded as a
non-partisan organization. But, as
some of the members said,
&quot;women can't remain non-partisan.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                               
*      *     *
So, in July, 1922, the Republican
Women's Club was organized, and
the Democratic Women's Club was
organized in 1925.
Mrs. E. T. McNew was first
president of the Republican women's organization, which was
founded at her home by 22
women.
First political steps, which have
been continued until today, were
to engage in house-to-house canvasses to interest women in voting, to sponsor volunteer workers
in wards and precincts, and to
advance women in every possible
way in politics.
The group now has more than I
100 active members, &quot;and we
don't depend on our husbands
to tell us how to vote,&quot; said Mrs.
Amos Caldwell, this year's president. &quot;We try to meet the candidates in person, if possible, and
we always study their platforms.&quot;
Other presidents of the group
have been Mesdames Marion
Miller, Will Gilbert, T. P. Miller,
Ethel King, I. C. King, Mack New-                                                                                                                                                man, Sylvia Hunter, Miss Nelle
Grammer, Mrs. Nicely, Mrs. Lucy
Dunn and Mrs. Levi York.
Active women in the Democratic Women's Club, of which
Mrs. Thomas Dowell is now president, have included Mrs. Sarah
Henry Hood, a charter member;
Miss Hattie Love, member of City
Council; Mrs. Charles Larew, Mrs.
Avon Acuff, Mrs. Walter Nash,
Mrs. W. W. Potter, Mrs. J. Gordon
Powers, Mrs. Richard Yearwood,
Mrs. J. B. Shinliever, Mrs. W. W.
Baird and Mrs. Charles Morse.
Mrs. Herman Schenk was first
president of the Democratic Women's Club, Mrs. Hood was first
vice-president; Mrs. J. C. Guinn,
second vice-president; Mrs. Frank
Hauer, third vcie-president; Mrs.
J. B. Shinliever, secretary; Mrs.
Emma Pate, treasurer, and Miss
Lucy Crozier, first parliamentarian.
&quot;Uplift work and law enforcement was our first undertaking,&quot;
Mrs.   Shinliever   said.
Both the women's organizations'
members agreed &quot;many women
who should be still aren't interested in politics . . . but we've
taken a long step since 1920.&quot;

<dc:description>The Necessity, Beneficence and Beauty of Law. Paper Read at Opening Meeting of Ossoli Circle, Monday, October 26th, by Mrs. L.C. French.
&quot;Ever the Rock of Ages melts
Into the mineral air,
To be the quarry whence is built
Thought and its mansions fair.&quot;
These lines indicate to us that poe
try, no less than religion, science and
philosophy, teaches the indestructabil-
ity of matter, the correlation and con
servation of force and the development
of   the  lower  into   higner  forms;   in
short, the oneness ot the universe.
Accept this statement as true and
the conclusion is inevitable that the
universe is governed by law, inexorable and eternal law, or it might be
more exact to say, the universe is law
executing itself.
Emerson calls the world &quot;a fagot of
laws,&quot; immortal and seif-protecting.
If this be true the work of man is to
acquire a knowledge of law so as to
keep   himself  in  harmony  with it.
The assertion has been made that
the instinct for law is primal and exists in every order of creatio. Ruskin
shows us in his Ethics of the Dust,
that clay following out the laws of its
being becomes the sapphire, that sand
reaches up to the opal, while soot or
charcoal becomes transfigured into the
diamond.
The rock crumbles and makes the
soil, from whence springs plant life,
that gives sustenance to the animal
which in its turn on the one hand
gives its refuse to enrich the soil and
on the other its body for food for man,
while the latter by the use of thought
improves himself as well as the animal and the plant.
When the soul of man passes into
the unknown his body mingles again
with the soil and the circle is complete. Thus we see that in nature
every debt is paid to the uttermost
farthing. The necessity of lavv is then
self-evident. the failure of one kingdom to supply the needs of another
would turn the universe into chaos.
Mineral, animal, vegetable and human
all work together for the good of all.
Thus can we truly sing witn the poet;
&quot;Ever the Rock af Ages  melts
Into the mineral air
To be the quarry whence is built
Thought and its mansions fair.&quot;
Victor Hugo has beautifully said:—-
&quot;The human intellect radiates and li1--
tie by little wins, subdues ami humanizes matter.&quot; ]
&quot;Sublime domestication.&quot; What, ben
*tne.ent and beautiful laws is science
revealing to us dav by Gay. How our
lives are enrched by its .improvements,
discoveries and inventions. J.t tea c he*
us that law exact and inexorable governs both great and small. Tnai m«
bee in its work is as exact and inva- ;.
liable as the stars in their course. Thr
microbe performs its function with th-&quot;
like promptness and preeus.-don tna&lt;
the sun does his.
Religion teaches us that the recog
nition of law and obedience to it is the
proof   of   the   great   and   the   good   of
all time.
Philosophers    have     devoted     the.Jr.
lives   to   the   study  of  universal  theo   !

the end of contributing to the instruction and hauDines.s of ma.n-kind.
Prom all great teachers do we learn
that the practice of virtue is as necessary to the well being of man as
is sufficient food. that, the universe is
founded on morality and surrounded
by goodness.
Says IViarcus Aurelius:—&quot;No longer
let thy breathing only act in concert
&quot;with the air which surrounds thee. hat.
let thy intelligence aiso now he m
harmony with the intelligence which
embraces all things. For the intelligent power is no less diffused in all
parts and pervades all things for him
who   is   willing   to      draw   it   to   him
and   we   will   know   the   right   and   it,
i will make us free.    It is the personal
| consideration which blinds the eye and
\ obscures the vision.
J      Let   i:s   now   consider   the   divisions
; ef law:
Webster's   definition:—&quot;A     law      is
that which is laid, sot or fixed, a rule |
of being or conduct established bv an
authority able td enforce its will,&quot;
Eurke  says:—-&quot;Law     is  beneficence]
. working by rule.&quot;
Cosmic or Divine law is that of the j
universe.     Natural law  is  that of the j
individual; eclesiasticai law that of the j
policy   of   a   church;     civil     law   that
which  applies to  members  of a community;  political law that of the government  of said community;   national
law that of communities in their relation to each other.
To formulate these laws, to study
them to shape our lives in harmony
with them and transmit this knowledge and power to posterity is
the first duty of the least as well as
of the greatest. Ignorance of the. law
either human or divine, furnishes no
immunity to the one who violates it.
Recognizing this Shakespeare wrote:—i
&quot;There is no darkness, but ignorance.&quot;
Ignorance of law is that dark shadow
which men have named evil.    Evil has

question  because T or.ce hea~d a lady
say that she thought the enforcement
of   parliamentary     law     in     women's
meetings was  ridiculous.
Are women so accurate in buMnrsi

lose no time? Are they' by instinct
perfectly just and impartial?
Order is heaven's first law, is it also

CHATTANOOGA'S &quot;HOT DOG&quot; QUARTETTE
TOOK FIRST PRIZE AT TORONTO CONVENTION
AND ENTERTAINED
 BANQUETERS LAST NIGHT

MRS. FRENCH TELLS LADY
KWANIANS OF NEW FIELD
Addressing Luncheon to Visiting   &quot;Squaws&quot;    Tells    Them
Right to Vote Has Given  Them    More    Strength    and
Power—Mrs. C. C. Rutherford Presides.
Telling the women present, that the
right to vote has given them more
strength and power than has ever
before been woman's possession, but
advising them to use this power for
the protection of their homes, and to
avoid partisan politics, Mrs. L. C.
French in an address at the luncheon
tendered by the wives of local Ki-
wanians to the visiting ladies, Thursday afternoon, at 2 o'clock, pointed
out how a wonderful work may be
done by women in this age of advancement of and opportunity for
women.
Mrs. French's speech was the principal address of the luncheon, and as
this was exclusively a woman's meeting, she confined her remarks to topics of particular interest, to the women of today. Mrs. French stated that
the age in which we now live is a
wonderful one. In &quot;the past two hundred  years,   she   said,   more   discov-
eries and inventions of importance to
man have been made than in all the
preceding  history  of  the  world.  But
not only in  material  ways is this  a
wonderful  age.   The   ideals   that  are
predominant     have     changed.   Mrs
French    said that she can   remember
when  men's    clubs  at    their    social
meetings did not employ themselves
in the interest of wholesome amusement  and   humanitarian   enterprises.
She declared that a new spiritual  dis-
covery  has  been   made   in  this   era,
that of the value of work for humanity,
interest    themselves    also    in    such
questions.
Kiwanis   Auxiliary
Mrs. Myer, of Chattanooga, spoke
on the ladies' auxiliary of the Kiwanis club that has been formed in Chattanooga and the work it is doing. The
club has forty-five members said Mrs.
Myer, and is at present supplying
eighty-seven children with milk. A
trained nurse is maintained by the
organization to visit homes needing
medical inspection and treatment.
Food, clothing and coal are furnished to needy families, and instead of
giving aid promiscuously last Christmas., the la[d]ies visited needy homes,
ascertained their greatest wants and
supplied them.
Mrs. Myer stated that the auxiliary
was first formed as a social adjunct
to the Chattanooga Kiwanis club, but
it was soon felt if the organization
was to be maintained, there must be
some definite objective other than, a
social one. As a woman's natural instincts lead her to think of the welfare of the child, hence the child welfare work was adopted as the main
objective of the auxiliary. A large
delegation from the organization was
present at the luncheon, and was
presented by Mrs.  Myer.
Mrs.   Rutherford   Presides
Mrs.  C.  C.  Rutherford  presided at
the meeting, introducing all speakers,
and the various numbers on the pro-
gram. In delivering her address of
welcome to the visitors in the city,
she said:
The ladies of the Knoxville Kiwanis Club wish to convey through
me, as their chairman, to the visiting ladies of the Convention, their
very great pleasure in being your
hostess on this occasion; also their
personal appreciation for such a large
attendance. It shows that we are interested in common with our husbands.
I have never seen a body of men so
deeply wedded to a club as are the
Kiwanians. I believe there is a great-
er per centage of real, live, active
members in the Kiwanis Club than
any other organization, and of course
we, as the wives, are very proud of
this fact.
Convention    Means    Much
I doubt if we fully appreciate and
realize what Kiwanis means to our
men, and I am sure that such conventions as this, where we can work
and learn more about Kiwanis, will
be a great inspiration to us. As I
study Kiwanis I am more and more
impressed with the fact that they
should have something like a Ladies'
Auxiliary, for I see many avenues in
which we could do good.
I am greeting you all today on behalf of The Knoxville Club. I sincerely hope that you will go away, from
the convention just as happy as we
are that you came.
Mrs. Hal Mould, of Pineville, Ky.,
responded to the greeting, expressing
her appreciation of the courtesies that
the Knoxville women have extended
the visitors and stating that she and
the other guests await an opportunity
for returning the hospitality that has
been so generously offered them in
this city.
Organization  Needed
Another   point  which  Mrs.  French 
stressed is the need of effective or- 
ganization for producing the best results   &quot;It is utter foolishness to  say
that &quot;you can work better alone,&quot; she
remarked. It is through organization
she reminded  her  audience  that the
great   things   of   the   world   are   accomplished.   As   an   example   of   an
what  may  be  accomplished  through
organization she mentioned the Parent-Teachers' Association. This body,
she stated, has a more clearly defined
work  than the  majority  of women's
clubs, and through its work for the
child, which is in line with woman's
natural  inclinations,   much  good  has
been accomplished.
Although some man may tell you
that women had more influence before they secured the ballot,&quot; said
Mrs French, &quot;don't believe him. It
isn't true. Women have more power
and strength right now through their
vote than they have ever had at any
other period in the world's history.
They can now safeguard their homes
from evil, she said, instead of having
to sit by passively and watch the
calamity befall.&quot;
This does not mean, she declared
that women must go outside of their
homes to find their work now; on
the contrary, woman's work lies as it
always has in the home, but it is her
duty to study civic questions with
her husband, and go to the polls and
do her duty by voting. Mrs. French
___mened the study of civic ques-
tions for the betterment of local con-
ditions in the towns in which the women present at the luncheon might
live for as wives of men interested
in a club standing for civic improvement it behooves them, she said, to (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>Points in parliamentary law, not suspected by many and little practiced in
many clubs, were made in rapid succession at the session, and a large number of the ladies quite distinguished
themselves for their aptness and ability.
A great deal of fun was created in
the beginning when &quot;fraternal delegates'' were received. Miss Lucy Graham Crozier brought credentials form (sic.)
a representative of Mars, &quot;the land
where the beehive hat is unknown&quot;, she
said, and &quot;where the women vote.&quot; This
brought on a furious argument, many
being unwilling to rick the uncertainty
in their midst of a representative of a
planet that had already caused so much
trouble.
The Question was asked of Miss Crozier if her delegate would expect her
expenses to be paid, and was assured
that the same was to be voted on without respect to &quot;age, sex or previous conclusion,&quot; and begged that her coming
into Tennessee be not a question of expense. The opposition was so strenuous
and the argument so irregular, the Mars
delegate being voted in, and then out
again, several times, that Miss Crozier
finally withdrew her motion, saying that
&quot;through the medium of thought transmission, she has been advised to do so,
Mars not wishing to participate in a
congress where women do not know
their own minds.&quot; This was a fair example of a bit of the fun that prevailed
but considerable serious work was done
before adjourning. The event proved a
brilliant success from  every  standpoint.
The final business session of the
year of Ossoli Circle will be held this
moring (sic.) at 10:30 at the Lyceum building. To this session it is urged that
both boards be present and all members if possible. Important business will
come up for transaction.
Among questions to be determined is
the possibility of bringing to Knoxville
for a lecture on Woman in Economics.
Miss Ethel Arnold, one of the most
brilliant women of the day, and a ardent advocate of woman's rights. She is
a sister of Mrs. Humphrey Ward who,
in strange contradiction has been fighting the cause as earnestly as her sister
had espoused it. Miss Arnold is a
granddaughter of Mathew Arnold and
has other distinguished connections aside
from which she would easily stand alone
as her own intellect, culture and learning entitle her to a place among brainy
men and women of the day.</dc:description>

<dc:description>JOHN H. CROZIER,
On last Tuesday evening the relatives
and friends of John H. Crozier in this
community were shocked upon receiving
the intelligence by telephone that he had
been cruelly murdered in Grainger county, on the north side of Clinch mountain,
and about six miles north of Tate Spring.
He was in discharge of his duty to a
client, a duty prosecuted with unswerv-
ing fidelity that brought upon him the
vengeance of the murderer, who had opposed, bitterly, the rightful taking, by the
law, of his property to recompense a
widow whom he owed, and whom he
sought to defraud. R. B. Bundren whom
he, Crozier, had sued, lived in an adjoin-
ing district to the one which Crozier resided in. Bundren was a self-constituted-
ruler of his district, a bold, domineering,
and much feared man. Crozier was called to the case, by the appeal of the
widow, because of his known fearlessness, and well known good faith in his
management of law suits, and it was this,
together with previous causes of irritation, perchance, that awakened the brutal passion of his slayer. He will be
missed in that community, for he was
ever the friend of the poor and defenseless, and a defiant obstructionist in the
road of a bully, and in the path of any
schemer with nefarious designs. As a
lawyer he fought to a finish, and to a
case he would lend his full effort, even
to the border of his life's peril. He lost self in the fight.
John H. Crozier, Jr., as he then was,
came to the bar of Knoxville in 1869. He
was thrust into practice at once. Into
cases of unusual magnitude for a young
[lawyer]. He bore himself well.      In  the
(missing) court, he was soon the first of
the young men that had come to the bar.
He thus be an a career, perhaps as brilliant
as that of any young man who ever
came to the Knoxville bar. It was full of
promise, and full, seemingly, to the limit
of any young man's ambition. He has
practice (sic.)    law    ever since. 
He was a much misunderstood man.
Faults he had, open, unconcealed, but he
was a stickler for truth, an iconoclast in
practice, with a face of flint against all
forms of oppression. He was not what
might be termed a gracious man, less of
the fortiter in re and more of the survi-
ter in mode might have made him a universal favorite; for he had integrity,
marked ability and a keen understanding
of men, but he disdained, always, the
supple bending of the knee, the vain
tawdry of society, the emptiness of
things, and perhaps to an excessive and
hyper-extreme. Even with these odds
against his political and professional success, he might have landed some of life's
most cherished prizes if he had been only
stirred by ambition. He didn't have it.
He was a theorist. In spite of the
world's opinion to the contrary his theory that ambition was a cheat, a whited
sepulchrre (sic.) was eminently right. He
deemed it cowardly to carry a pistol.
But for his theory he might be alive, for
though he was wary of the entrance to a
quarrel, being in he bore himself so that
his opponent and others thereafter remembered him. He was stoical. Life's
relentless jars, disappointments, grievances, were complacently retired as each
rolled over him. He didn't recount them,
nurse them. His views of life were
just, but an imperious will power oft erratic, enthroned his every action, often
to the detriment of his best temporal interests. He could not, when he believed
himself right, however, and he lived himself without deceit, without parade, without a yearning for the things precious to
most men, and when the crucial measure
shall come, if it comes, and we hope, believe, John Crozier will measure up high
with his fellow man, because the Great
Measurer will adjust the scale with exactness that is immaculately exact, and
with a justice that is eternally just.
John H. Crozier was born in this city
August 14, 1846. Though young, he entered the confederate army in 1861, and
gave honorable and gallant service to the
cause of the south. Upon the cessation of
war, he returned home to this city, end
entered upon the study of law with his
father, Colonel John H. Crozier, then
one of the most distinguished lawyers in
the state, and a man of ability and renown, and with a commanding law practice.
 He didn't seek
a practice there, but his reputation followed him, and it sought him. He drifted
into it, liked the surroundings, and could
never be induced by persuasin (sic.) or offers
to return to Knoxville or go elsewhere.
In the later years of life he devoted
himself and beguiled his time with the
study of mechanics, and especially as ap- 
plied to the forceful navigation of the
air. He had a high order of mathematical
talent. He was accurate in his findings in
this science as he had been in his judg- 
ments of the law. The invention he patented for the forceful navigation of the
air was his last in this line, and remains
yet for final test.
He was ever busy, active, energetic and
strong. He was always ready to defend
the poor or persecuted, and did many
charities this wise, and of actual gift to
those who needed it.
But John Crozier is gone. Cruelly shot
down by a murderer &quot;lying in wait.&quot; The
charity of the world that knew will now
be extended to him, too often withheld in
life. He erred. Who has not? When his
credits are accounted and his whole life
reviewed, the adverse comments of those
who in his life indulged them, will take
flight in the face of the many better
deeds of the man, lawyer and friend, now
dead.
Marc Antony revealed human nature
for political and demagogic effect, when
he said the &quot;good is oft interred with
our bones.&quot; Not so. Humanity quakes he-
fore a yawning grave and tremblingly renders to &quot;Caesar the things that are Cae-
sar's&quot; there, hence, &quot;the good that men
do lives after them.&quot; And the good that
John H. Crozier did will percolate like
water through sand, as time goes, and
the memory of them will soften criticism
and render justice to his life and name.
If erratic himself, he was generous to
the faults of others; if he combatted you,
he did it without dishonor; if called to
face a question requiring great moral
courage he did it without fear of personal consequences. His manhood was
strong. His friendship unwavering, and in
the tranquil peace of death he is judged
now with a judgment free from the prejudices and bias that followed his life-
path, and with a charity that sees the
man more rationally in the places and
scenes that will never know him again.
A FRIEND.</dc:description>

<dc:description>TWO WARDS GO ON RECORD FOR
ALDERMAN FORM
Twentieth  and Twenty-First
Ward Taxpayers Hold
Meeting.
Officers were elected and resolutions denouncing the present administration and favoring a return
to the aldermanic form of government were adopted at a recent
meeting of taxpayers of the twentieth and twenty-first wards, held
in the Junior Order United American Mechanics' hall.
The officers, to head the taxpayers' movement, were named as follows: J. V. Pierce, chairman;
George N. Wagoner, secretary.
Executive committee, B. L. Monday, chairman; H. M. Mynatt, Mrs.
Roddy, Mrs. Doyle, U. L. Barker,
French Brogden, and Tommie
Compton.
The resolution was adopted as
follows:
&quot;First, whereas, the city administration has climaxed a long line
of blunders in which the people of
Knoxville are made the victims of
the rankest type of fraud, that
they have ever known, with an unjust and ridiculous tax assessment.
&quot;Second, whereas, the result of
this assessment, if it is allowed to
stand will result in wholesale robbery of the small home owners of
this community and adjacent communities.
&quot;Third, whereas, we have looked
upon our city administration with
tolerance and forbearance, giving
our officials every opportunity to
make good   their   task   that they
would give us   economic and   fair
government.
&quot;Therefore, be it resolved, that
we do hereby condemn the present
city tax assessment as being an attempt to rob the people, that we
condemn the city council or those
members who voted for this mon-
trosity  (sic.) (the Somers system) or
who have in any other way aided
and abetted in forcing it upon the
back of the people.
&quot;Second, we unequivocally condemn Mayor Ben A. Morton and
the members of the council who
have blindly followed him; the city
tax assessor, L. O. W. Bonham, and
the back tax collector, John Rogers; who have aided in this scheme
to defraud, and we respectfully
suggest that they tender their resignation, as the only service they
can render that would be of value
to the citizens of Knoxville at this
time.
&quot;Third, we condemn, as the
worst foe that the people have, the
Knoxville News-Sentinel and the
Knoxville Journal. We pledge ourselves and we call upon the taxpayers and: citizens throughout the
city to join in the pledge to vote
and work against everything for
which the newspapers stand as being the only safe course to pursue
in any matter relating to our city
government, this course alone
would lead to relief. We appeal to
the city-at-large for a safe and
sane leadership to lead the home
owners and the taxpayers of Knoxville out of the mire of debt, injustice, broken promises and personal favorites into which we have
fallen.
&quot;Fourth, we favor a general
clean-up of all the city officials
with the exceptions of Councilmen
Monday, Sterling and Blanc.
&quot;Fifth, we stand for the old aldermanic system of government,
the plan of our forefathers, that
has never failed.&quot;</dc:description>

Col. Arthur R. Crozier asks us to
change the direction of his copy of
The Gazette-from Graham, Texas, to
Blanket, Texas, a station on the Fort
Worth and Rio Grande railroad, located in Brown county, where, in the family of his son, Dunlap Crozier, he expects to spend his last days. Col. C. will
be pleasantly remembered by many of
our older readers. For many years—
more than a third of a century ago—
he was an important factor in the
Democratic party of the State, especially in East Tennessee. He was elected State Comptroller three successive
terms, and no more competent or hon-
ester officer ever filled that responsible position. His former friends and
associates will be gratified to hear
that he is enjoying excellent health.
His chirography—if he would only
apply a soft pencil to soft paper, rather
than a hard pencil to hard paper—has
all the feminine neatness and steadiness of nerve that used to mark his 
editorial manuscripts while conducting
the old Knoxville Standard. Col. Crozier began the 89th year of a good and
useful pilgrimage on earth December
1, 1898. May he live to enjoy many
returns of that anniversary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            (Handwritten note: Born Dec. 1, 1809. Died June 15, 1899    Arthur R. Crozier.  Blanket, Texas.  Dec. 1, 1898 was his 89th birthday.  See strip from Morristown Gazette of Feb. 1, 1899.)

<dc:description>FUNERAL 0F
MISS CORNELIA CROZIER
Tribute Paid to the Memory of
a Well Known Woman.
The   funeral   of   [Miss]   Cornelia   Croz[ier]
was   conducted  from  St.   John's  Episco[pal]
church   Sunday   afternoon,   December (missing)
at   two   o'clock   bb   the   rector,     Rev.  (missing)
Walter   C.   Whitaker.     The   pall     bea[rers] _
were:    Dr.  A. P   White, Mr.  H.  T.  (missing)
Mr.  James   Scott,  Mr   John  M.   Allen,
Henry  Lenoir  and Mr.   Robert  Kella (missing)
As   the     flower-covered     casket     moved
slowly down the aisle to the organ's deep-  
toned accompaniment   under    the    sympa-
thetlc touch of Mr. Frank Nelson, and the
well  trained  choir  added to the solemnity  
of  the   occasion,   memory   swept  one   back 
 to the long ago when, upon so many similar  occasions,  had  been  heard Miss  Cro-
zier's  splendid  voice.
Her intimate connection with St. John's
Episcopal church dates far back. Bishop
Otey was Tennessee's first Episcopal
bishop, and when Bishop Otey made his
initial visit to Knoxville, there were just
two avowed Episcopalians: William Ethel-
red Williams, Miss Cornelia Crozier's
grandfather, and Thomas McMullen, grandfather of Mrs. Edward Oates, Messrs.
James Wallace and Hugh Rodgers and
 Mrs.   Frank  Clark.
At ten years of age. Miss Crozier was
bridesmaid, while her brother, Ethel Crozier, scholar, musician and courty (sic.)  gen-
tleman, aged fourteen, was groomsman in
old St. John's, at the wedding of a cous-
in, one of the most beautiful belles of
 Tennessee's early  days,  Miss Mary  Hume.
St. John's is, today,
a  new face  (missing)
, but despite the added archi-
tectural   grandeur,   the
beautiful  structure  dear to the hearts of
many   among   Knoxville's pioneer citizens.
None was more interested in the advancement of her church, nor more generous in her efforts and labors than Miss
Cornelia Crozier. A devout Episcopalian,
she gave of her time and talents free  (missing)
for  the upbuilding of St.  John's.
Miss   Crozier   was   a   woman   of   grea[t]
force,   despite   the    frailty     of   the   she (missing)
which   encased   the   indomitable   woman-
soul.    Practical,   energetic,   yet   shrinking
from   notoriety,   cultured,   refined,  artistic
in  taste and  instinct, loyal in the highest
degree  to   friend   and  principle—in  short,
selfless—hers was a  rare personality  and
 her going will leave a void in the hearts
of  those  who  dwelt  within   the  circle  of
 her  regard.
 Miss Crozier comes from a family which
has been prominent in the intellectual life
 of  Knoxville.     Her  father,   Hon.   John   V
Crozier,   was    acknowledged   one   of   the
 brainiest   men  ever  sent  by  Tennessee   to
 congress.    She is survived by four sisters
Mrs.   L.   Crozier   French,   Miss   Lucy   Crozier-
and  Misses  Mary   and  Anna  Crozier, &quot;
 ail women of dominance and Individuality 
At   the  conclusion   of   the  church   serv-
ices,   Miss   Crozier's   remains   were   borne 
 to Old Gray cemetery, and laid to rest in
 the family lot.    As the sun burst through
sullen   clouds   that   darkened   the   sky,   to
 illumine  the   flower-banked     mound,     be- 
neath which lay this noble Christian wo- 
man,  who was  so  truly  of  the  &quot;pure  in 
heart,&quot; those who turned from her resting
place thought how fitting it was that the
cold, hard clods should be hidden beneath 
gracious  bloom.    Possibly  next  to   a  passionate love of music. Miss  Crozier  loved
flowers.    Some  who watched the exquisite
'floral   offerings  transform  crude  (missing)
a  mound   of  bloom,   were  minde (missing)
deft fingers whose magic touch h (missing)
ten in the years  gone by, when
had neither florist nor  greenhou (missing)
wreaths and posies for the brid (missing)
burial.     It   seemed   fitting   that  (missing)
generous soul should rest bene (missing)
rant   blanket   despite  December  (missing)
sky. ANNIE   BOOTH M[cKinney]</dc:description>

<dc:description>Suffrage in Indiana.
Indiana women have won suffrage. The
bill giving them the right to vote for presidential electors, for almost all state officers and in municipal elections passed
the Indiana house by a vote of 67 to 24
and the senate by a vote of 32 to 16. Gov-
ernor Goodrich has said that he will sign
it. The measure will go into effect when
the governor proclaims the enforcement of
the statutes passed by the present legislature, probably in-April. Women will vote
for the first time at the election to select
delegates to the constitutional convention
in September. 
With Indiana on the list of free states— I
and   counting   presidential   suffrage  estab-
lished in Ohio—women  will vote in fifteen 
states  and   one   territory.     They   will   cast 
their   votes   for   135   presidential   electors, 
influencing the selection of more than one- 
fourth of the whole electoral college.    They
will   have  weight  in   the  choice   of  ne(missing)
one-fourth   of  the  house  and   one-th(missing)
the Senate. •</dc:description>

<dc:description>Miss Anthony's Birthday.       Susan B. Anthony's birthday this month
was celebrated on the suffrage picket line
in Washington in an impressive and beau-
tiful manner.    In  the face of heavy  snow
and rain dozens of young women stood in
line holding high special banners made for :
the   occasion' which   proclaimed   the   un- 
swerving  policy  of the  suffrage  leader  in
holding   parties   responsible   and   putting
&quot;suffrage  first.&quot;    Thousands  of men  and 
women streaming  home from  work in  the 
early   evening   paused  to  read  the  gallant
banners   that   so   absolutely   upheld   the
policy of the young banner bearers of today.
The   big   golden   flags  were   lettered   as
 follows:
&quot;We press our demands for the ballot at 
this time in no narrow, captious or selfish
spirit,&quot; read the first banner, &quot;but from 
purest patriotism, for the highest good 
of every citizen, for the safety of the republic and as a glorious example to the nations of the earth.&quot;
&quot;At this time our greatest need is not
men or money, valiant generals or bril- 
liant victories, but a consistent national 
policy based upon the principle that all
governments derive their just powers from 
consent of the governed.&quot;
The third Susan B. Anthony banner bore
this   inscription:   &quot;The   right   of   self-gov-
ernment  for   one-half  of  its   people   is   of far  more  vital  consequence  to  the  nation,
 than any or all other questions',&quot;
So impressed by the line was a Baltimore 
 clergyman   that  he   took   a   picture  of  the 
bannered pickets to show to the young 
women of his Sunday school, promising a 
delegation from his church for the picket 
line in the near future. A woman who also 
caught the truly religions spirit of the 
pageant like procession stepped up to the
leader of the procession and said &quot;I wonder
 if you realize the mediaeval spectacle
you young women present; you have made
us realize, that this cause is a crusdae.&quot;
Lawyers, doctors and nurses have stood
on the suffrage picket line on their res- 
pective days this week, and at the &quot;picket 
teas&quot; held at headquarters after the pick-
eting is over each day, different speakers 
have described the new spirit that is ani-
mating the suffrage movement largely be-
cause women are willing to visualize the 
movement to the man and woman on the
street.</dc:description>

<dc:description>THE REASON WHY

By Mary .Johnston,
I am a woman working for my living.
I own property, I pay taxes; I am assessed for this and that. I have a stake
city, in my state, in the United
in the communal life of our race.
I am a member, for better or for worse
of the human society. I cannot escape,
if I would. I am a part of the pattern,
as integral as any other. I receive from
this society and I Contribute to it. 1
have at heart the improvement of my
own milieu, and  I have the altruist's
desire for the improvement of that of
my fellow beings.
I have never seen the reason why I,
as well as my neighbors, the butcher.
the baker, the candlestick maker, the
chief cook and bottle washer, and my
neighbors of tomorrow, the male Sicilian
and the Slav, should not have a voice in
my community and state as to taxation,
as to what ideals of government can be
made real and what not, as to the welfare in general of that society of which
I am, indubitably, a member. I see no
reason, indeed, why I should not have
it as well as my neighbor, the lawyer,
the editor, the physician and the divine. 
It is my conviction that, in the long
evolution of the race and of political societies, the time has arrived when there
is little sense in any longer bracketing
the two words, sex ad suffrage. I believe in restricted suffrage, but restriction should be on other grounds than on
that of having been born a woman. In-
telligence directed toward the general
good, an honestly won and held foothold in life, character dedicated to the
uplift of all conditions for us all—these
are the desiderata. Intelligence, conscience, character, power to assume responsibility and to work the problem are
not confined to the male organism.
Physiologically differentiated as they
are, man and woman are yet essentially
the same. They are interdependent
branches of one substance, and they begin life with an equal mental inheritance. The man has his mother in him,
the woman has her father. Nothing after birth occurs to justify the supposition
that woman does not know right  from
 wrong, clean politics from self-seeking
or indifference, altruism from egotism.
large thought for the future from a
supine resting on the past or a ruinous
dalliance with the present. Even the
stock argument—woman cannot fight—-
seems to me a little shop-worn, a trifle
over-worked.    Perhaps, like other war-
riors, she may find a substitute
Perhaps, if she still attends to things at
home while the men go fight, it will 
come to be considered only a fair division
of labor. It may, perhaps be re-
membered for her that, when al is said,
she bore the soldier. Assuredly the
south will not be the land to say that
woman cannot take her share of war.
The government of the United States   
is founded upon two statements:--   
Taxation  without    representation    is
tyranny.
^ Governments derive their just powers
front the consent of the governed. </dc:description>

<dc:description>N THE INTEREST OF VOTES FOR WOMEN
THE KNOXVILLE EQUAL SUFFRAGE LEAGUE.
Edited by Emma Farrand Tyler.
STATEMENT BY
SUSAN B. ANTHONY
To the editor of the Suffrage department
of The Journal and Tribune.
Madam:—The following statement regarding Susan B. Anthony has appeared
in newspapers all over the country:
&quot;She was unalterably opposed to political partisanship, believing that the
suffrage could be obtained only through
the assistance of its friends in all parties.&quot;
Historical evidence does not bear out
this  assertion-
In 1869, at the first national convention  of  the National  Association.   Miss
Anthony's   position   was   enunciated   by
the president in the following words:
&quot;No harmonious    action    on any
question can ever be secured except
as a strict party measure.      Hence
we appeal to the party in power.&quot;
In 1872,  after    all    the parties  had,
through    their    platforms,     taken their
stand on the Woman Suffrage isue (sic.),  an
appeal was sent out in the name of the
National Woman Suffrage association.
&quot;Women  of  the  United States.&quot;
it    read,     &quot;the hour    for    political
action has come!   For the first time
in   the history  of  our  country   woman has been recognized in the platform of large and dominant party.&quot;
The appeal  then went on to explain
the refusal of the democratic party and
of the  liberal party,  under  the  leadership of Horace Greeley,  to support the
demand of women,  and closed with an
impassioned appeal to women of all parties to lay aside all party affiliations and
work for the success  of the republican
party.
&quot;Let us throw our whole influence
of voice and pen into this campaign
and. in making it a success for the
republican party, make it a success
for ourselves. Do not hesitate, do
not vacillate: let no party or personsal
consideration bias you to act against
the republican party at this momen-
tous crisis. Remember that we
owe it a debt of gratitude that it
has made for us this opportunity,
that it has thus launched our cause
into the political arena, where it
must go on and on, till justice for
women shall at last triumph, in a
true republic; a government of the
people, by the people and for the
people.&quot;
On behalf  of the National association,
SUSAN B. ANTHONY. President.
MATILDA JOCELYN GAGE,
Chairman executive committee.
The  Rev.   Olympia  Brown,  who was
one  of  the leaders of  the  white house
demonstration on  March  4th,  was  one
of the pioneers who campaigned for the
republican   party   in  this   campaign   of
1872, as a result of that appeal to women.
In June, 1872, Miss Anthony said:
&quot;My view of our true position, is
to hold ourselves as a balance of
power, to give aid and comfort to
any party which shall inscribe on
its banners 'Freedom for Women.' If
I am a republican or liberal or
democrat, per se, and work for that
party right or wrong (that is, regardless of the record and position
of that party on Woman Suffrage)
then I make myself and my coworkers no added power for or
against the one which adopts or rejects our claims for recognition.
&quot;I do not expect any man to see and act with me here,
 but  I   can-
not understand how any woman can 
do otherwise than refuse to accept
the party that ignores her sex.&quot;
This party policy she adhered to with
undeviating    devotion,  regardless of the
label of the party  in power.       In 1878
she said,   replying  to criticisms of  her
position:
&quot;It is not that I have no opinions
on the many     and grave questions
that distract and divide the parties,
but it is that, in my judgment, the
right  of  self   government  for   one-
half  of  the people is of far  more
vital consequence to the nation than
any or all other questions.&quot;
In 1894 she again took a party position;  this  time against both  the  democratic and republican parties and in favor of the populist party. 
On page 792 of the Life of Susan B.
Anthony,   by   Ida   Husted   Harper,   we
find Miss Anthony quoted as saying:
&quot;I am for Woman Suffrage, and
will work with any party that will
help us.      Remember  I say &quot;'with,'
not 'for' &quot;
In reply to a letter from Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt to Miss Anthony (quoted
on this same page), discussing the probable results of Miss Anthony's position
in favor of the populists. Miss Anthony
replies:
On page 794 of the same volume we
find her replying to a criticism from
Henry B. Blackwell because she was
supporting the populist party.
&quot;I have not allied myself with any
party nor shall I ally    myself with,
any party,  save the one of justice
and equality for women; but the time
has come when I  strike,   and proclaim my contempt for the tricksters
 who put their political heel on the
rights  of  women at the very time,
when their help is needed most.    I
never,    in    my   whole  forty   years
work, so utterly repudiated any set
of politicians as I do those republicans    of    Kansas.      When it is a
mere matter of theory, a   thousand
miles away from  a  practical question, they can 'resolve' pretty words,
but, when the crucial moment comes
they  sacrice(sic).  us  without  conscience
or  honor.       The  hubbub  with  the
republicans  shows    that    they  have
been hit in the right place.&quot;
Then,  reasserting that same splendid
gospel  of  loyalty  of  women  to  women
that    she    had    proclaimed    in    1872,
twenty-two years before, she said:
&quot;I was never surer of my position
that no self-respecting woman should
wish or work for the success of a
party   that    ignores     her    political
rights.&quot;
This was the identical position taken
by the Congressional Union and the
Woman's party in the recent campaign.
It endorsed no candidate or party, but
opposed the party in power, which, with
the power to act, refused by official
caucus vote, to aid the cause of women.
After reading the papers today, and
noting the small consideration given to
the disfranchised women who, forgetting
the fight of women for women, gave
their aid to the democratic party, regardless of its opposition to their sex, I
am wondering if perhaps they will not
ponder deeply on Miss Anthony's words
of 1872:
&quot;I cannot understand how any
self-respecting woman can do otherwise than refuse to accept any party
that ignores her sex.&quot;
HELEN HILL WEED.
Research chairman, Congressional Union
for Woman Suffrage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Educational Myopia.
The shortsightedness of our state legislature has brought about a condition
which is working against the object of
our educational system—the development
of an intelligent citizenship. Our self-
satisfied citizen sits complacently by,
while our legislators make laws, such
as county school boards. Why should
men exclusively govern our schools'?
What have a man's party affiliations to
do with his ability to educate the young?
Yet it is an accepted fact that the
schools, like other offices of the state
government, are controlled for political
patronage. With all the money expended by the state for schools and
school purposes, the state of Tennessee
remains one of the most illiterate in the
Union.
Twenty-five years ago there was absolutely no qualification necessary to be a
member of the school board. Men were
not questioned whether they could even
read or write. This was in time changed
and to &quot;read and write&quot; was made the
first qualification. Then a little higher
education was asked and so have the
board been struggling on for this last
quarter of a century. With what result?
That today Tennessee is still steeped in
illiteracy, notwithstanding the fact that
twenty-five per cent of the state's taxes
are devoted to educational work. If
men have fallen so short in their efforts,
why will they persist in making laws
that bar all but &quot;qualified voters&quot; from
school   boards ?
And   why   was   this   law   made?     To
shut out the women.    And why shut out
women?    Because the politicians control
and wish  to control the school funds. A
man in East Tennessee said under oath
that   a   county   superintendent   declared
that the  board of education is the very 
finest   political   asset   a   man   can   have.
Are we to sit calmly by, purblind to all 
this?    About twenty-seven states in the 
Union give to women a vote for school 
officers.   There are any number of
women on county and city school boards
and  acting as county  and  city  superin-
tendents.    The eastern and the western
states   have     recognized     woman's   efficiency   and   such   short   sightedness   on
the part of Tennessee legislators, should
be   overcome.     It  is  only   in   the   south
that educational myopia  remains a  per-
vasive  disease.

<dc:description>Equal Suffrage Department. Editors: Mrs. Julia Lucky, President of Equal Suffrage League, and Mrs. Sara H. Hood, Secretary. 
Seeking health and resting here by
wonderful Gulf of Mexico, one finds
that not even its charm and beauty can
bring forgetfullness(sic.) of the cause of
Equal Suffrage. Watching the great
water with its ebbing and flowing tides,
one begins to seek types and compar-
isons. (Sometimes quiet and shimmering like jewels in the sun. it dazzles and
attracts by the ______ variety of its
appearance. But not long this quiescence
stage. Power lies underneath and
the winds of unrest, as in the woman
soul, began to mow and ripple after ripple,
 wave after wave break upon the
shore, w___e ever and still ever to the
attentive ear, comes and an always deep-
ening sound.  At first far distant one
scarcely catches it, but nearer and more
insistent the booming voices is heard.
It frightens, it terrifies the timid soul,
it speaks of storm aim possible danger,
yet to man who comprehends, this violent
change is beneficent. The gentle rip-
pies loving and caressing your feet are
beautiful,   but   it needs the great waves
coming from   the deepest depths, to s__e
every  atom of water to new and health-bringing  life.     Lacking this
Stress,   vitality   would   sink
into death, while the great gulf stream would no longer temper the too excessive heat of some lands, nor mitigate the fierce cold that would freeze still other countries.
What matter if the current at times be too swift, or the waves too rough, and
some  vessels
go down, and some lives be lost?  Evil must ever go with the
good,   and the benefits outweigh the
losses.     While we see these things, our
thoughts turn to the gulf stream of progress.  Beautifully
it curls and dances on the shores of our new age.  But soon the gentle ripples under the impulse of awaking knowledge changes to waves, while loud and ever louder come the booming notes that show that the great
depths of womanhood are stirred, and
its strongest powers aroused to do their
great work. Out of the turmoil and
storm of these great waters, irresistable(sic.)
in their advances, will come blesings (sic.) to
the   whole   world.     The   heat   of   strife
and militancy and the wisdom will no
longer burn and enfeeble, while the chill
of misunderstanding, bitterness and prej-
udice will melt away under the glowing
warmth of woman's work. We know
not definitely of beginnings of the gulf
stream, but we do know that the stream
of woman's emancipation took its rise
at Seneca Falls. N. Y. in 1848. For
sixty-five years its current has moved
on and ever on. Sometimes slowly, yet
as inevitably and irresistibly as the
waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Higher
and higher beat its waves upon the
shores of our country; louder and more
compelling sounds the booming of the
power beneath. Storms may come, evils
may follow, yet the results will be good
for this current of equal rights and duties, bears in its bosom the great forces
that make for the highest welfare of the
world. These forces are clarified knowledge, warm, throbbing human interest,
peace, harmony, and justice,— and the
greatest of these is Justice.     J.  S. L</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Tennessee Campaign at Close Range
THAT Tennessee will be the 36th state to ratify the
suffrage amendment is a prospect that every day
becomes increasingly hopeful. The suffrage issue
has been one of the outstanding questions at a time when
the entire state is involved in a seething factional contest, and it has been difficult to save the cause from
sacrifice in this factional fight. This the National
Woman's Party has so far been able to do, because of
its indifference and aloofness to local issues, and its
single plank platform and single track policy of suffrage first, and nothing else. There are two factions in
the state organization of the Democratic Party which
are at each other's throats, and there are very few local
women who have not some interest in the outcome of
the struggle. The Republicans are also an aggressive
element in their concentration to break through the Solid
South with Tennessee this year. The state is noted for
its political storms, and this is the stormiest season it
has had for years. Each faction seeks to discount the
sincerity of the other on every issue, including suffrage.
As between the two factions of Democrats, the Republicans appear to hold the balance of power.
A Political Triangle
For suffragists, therefore, the field is a triangle.
Governor A. H. Roberts, who has served only one
term, is seeking endorsement in a primary for nomination by the Democratic Party to succeed himself. He is
being opposed for the nomination by W. R. Crabtree of
Chattanooga, who has the support of Colonel Luke Lee,
one of the most aggressive and picturesque characters in
Tennessee politics. Colonel Lea has a suffrage record
that dates back to his vote for the amendment in the
United States Senate in 1915. Governor Roberts, on the
other hand, through his association with Senator Shields
in the campaign of 1918, when the National' Woman's
Party made an effort to &quot;smoke out&quot; Senator Shields, is
placed somewhat at a disadvantage when he claims to be
a bona fide suffragist. The Roberts forces have shown
some resentment at what they claim is Colonel Lea's
effort to assume leadership as the champion of ratification at this time. They say that Governor Roberts is as
good a suffragist as Colonel Lea; that he is putting his
full strength behind the movement, and will be entitled
to such credit as will come from its passage. The Lea
forces contend that Governor Roberts has been forced
to do all that he has done for suffrage, and that he will not
do any more than he is forced to do.
Between the two camps of Democrats, the Republicans
sit quietly and smile, claiming that they are the deciding-
factor in the present ratification fight just as they were
in the passage of the. presidential suffrage bill.
Another feature in the situation is the general impression that Governor Cox, the Democratic nominee for
president, who says he is doing all he can for ratification in Tennessee, is inclined to favor Governor Roberts.
For the Republican nomination for governor, one of
the strongest candidates is Jesse Littleton, former mayor
of Chattanooga, who has a good suffrage record to his
credit. Each faction of the Democrats say that the other
faction cannot stand against Littleton in November
whether women vote or not, but they may not hold to this
position after the primary. At least, it seems that with the
women of Tennessee already exercising presidential suffrage either of the parties will be loathe to have fastened
upon it the responsibility for the defeat of ratification in this
state. Persistent effort has been made by the National
Woman's Party to secure pledges from a majority of the
members of the Legislature. A movement is on foot to
secure a solid vote on the part of the Republicans, and the
Woman's Party has detailed Miss Anita Pollitzer, legislative secretary, to interview the Republican members.
Mrs. Anne Calvert Neely of Vicksburg, Mississippi, is
working in the western end of the state with headquarters
at Memphis, where she will be in constant touch with
Senator McKellar and Congressman Fisher, who have
helped in ratification campaigns in other states. Headquarters have been opened in Nashville on Sixth Avenue
within two blocks of the State Capitol. The state chairman
and Miss Betty Gram are stationed here, where they will be
joined by other workers from National headquarters. Miss
Catherine Flanagan is canvassing the legislators in -the
northeastern section with headquarters at Johnson City.
The deputations to Governor Cox and Senator Harding
and the resulting emphasis placed upon the Tennessee situation, together with the resolutions passed by the National
Democratic and Republican committees relating to ratification by Tennessee, have done much to arouse interest in the
state, and the unwilling members are very much worried.
They see the national contest involved in the situation.
Proclamation Still to Come
The proclamation for the session has not been issued,
but Governor Roberts has given assurances that it will
be issued in plenty of time. There is no special term of
notice required by the Tennessee constitution for a special session of the legislature. August 9th, the date he
has named, is getting near at hand, and there is a well
defined demand upon him to issue the call without further delay. This demand, proceeding from Democratic
forces independently of suffrage influences, will probably
continue up to the date of his primary on August 5th,
unless the proclamation is issued before that time. After
that time, the demand probably will still be continued
from Republican sources to say nothing of the demands
of suffragists. The question would then arise: could
Governor Roberts as a Democratic governor afford to
delay issuing the call for a session of the legislature in
accordance with his promise to do so?
The intensity with which each faction is fighting for
supremacy makes the suffrage campaign a most difficult
one, and the outcome cannot be foreseen at this time.
Sue S. White,
Tennessee Chairman of the Woman's Party.

<dc:description>WOMAN SUFFRAGE
Some weeks since, Dr. Broughton
preached on &quot;Paul and the Women,&quot; and
particularly with reference to votes for
women. I heard the sermon referred to,
and enjoyed its beautiful language, always
chaste and above criticism. Its rheotric (sic.)
was without fault; its rounded periods
were so arranged as to form one splendid
gem of literature. But its logic was very
disappointing to me. I went to hear the sermon for the purpose of getting a good
logical, working reason why women should
not be allowed to vote. The text I. Cor.
11-3, &quot;But I would have you know that
the head of every man is Christ, and that
the head of the woman is the man, and
the head of Christ is God.&quot; This may—I
say it: may—refer to domestic relations in
the mind of the writer. I do not pretend
to enter Dr. Broughton's own domain and
interpret the apostle for him, but I wonder why he did not take for his text I.
(Cor. 14, 4-35,'&quot;Let your women keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they
are commanded to be under obedience as
also saith the law. And if they will learn
anything, let them ask their husbands at
home, for it is a shame for women to
speak  in  the  church.&quot;
This certainly is one step removed from
The home, and the prohibition here is
plain and positive, yet a literal application of this would not be allowed in the
doctor's own church. In I. Cor. 11 immediately following the text, the writer
goes into a detailed uncovered head,—
certainly a non-essential as applied to the
customs of today. In verses eleven and
twelve, he seems to get away from the
petty controversies of that church and de-
clares a broad equality of man and woman, each essential and equal to the other.
In   Paul's   day,   the   science   of   government was but little developed.    Democracy
was   not   known   to   Paul,   though   perhaps
the  freedom  of    the  individual  had    been
dreamed  of  by  some  of   the   Grecian  and
Roman   statesmen.     In   Paul's     day     the
man's  relation  to  the government  was  to
pay   his   tax  and   be   silent   about   the   administration of public affairs.    He nowhere
referred   to  any   participation   of   his   own
in   affairs   of   state.     There   is   no   &quot;tally  sheet&quot; to show that he ever voted.    Since
he   took   no   part   in   governmental   affairs
except   to   declare   that   &quot;the   powers   that
be are ordained of God,&quot; we could hardly
presume,  though he was inspired, that his
writings  could  have  any  relation  or  bearing  upon  political  matters,   except from  a
standpoint   of  general   morals.     We  might
as   well   say   he  forbade   a   high   tariff   or
the  German  submarine  warfare  as  to  say
 he forbade woman suffrage.    But it would
 seem in harmony with Paul's logic In spir-
itual   teaching  for  him    to  declare  in  the
 light   of  present  day   events  that  if    the
 woman is held to be amenable to the law
 In  its  civil  and  criminal  application,     she
 should  have  a  voice  in   making  that law.
 It is as logical that  Gideon's request that
 the   sun   stand   still   until    he  fought    his
battles  proves   that   the   sun   moves   about
 the   earth   as   it   is    to   declare   that   he
 text  forbade  woman   suffrage.    

The man is amenable to the law. If he J
Is a criminal he will be deprived of his
liberty,  possibly of his life.
The   woman   is  amenable   to   the   law   in
every way and in every condition in which 
the man Is. 
The  second  reason    assigned      by      the
 preacher, that women should not vote is a
 physiological   one.   She,   not   being   able   to
 defend the issues of the ballot by physical
strength;   or,   in  other   words,   as   she   can-
not shoulder her musket and march on to
war by the side of her brother, she should
not   be   allowed   to   go   to   the   ballot   box
with  him.   If physical  strength  is  made  a
condition   of   suffrage,   it   would   certainly
give  the  prerogative  of  full  citizenship  to
some   women   and   deny   it   to   some   men.
Many  men of middle and past  middle  life
could not &quot;defend the issues of the ballot&quot;
with the bullet. Within the last few years,
it  is  proved  beyond, a  doubt that our  sisters can render most efficient help in time
of war. If woman cannot go to the trenches
with her brother,  she can go to the fields
and  make  bread  for  her  brother  and  she
can go to the munitions plant and prepare
the   deadly   missiles   to   be   used   in   battle
by   her   brother   of stronger   build.     It   is
agreed   that   the   average   man   has   more
avoirdupois than the average woman; that
in  a  prize fight he could probable  &quot;knock
her  out   of   the   ring,&quot;   out  it    does      not
logically   follow   that   on   that   account   he
should have the greater political privileges,
 or that she should yield to him her inher-
 ent right, if not accustomed right, of voice
in a democratic government. Dr. Broughton
would  not  admit  that might  makes  right,
but his &quot;physiological&quot; argument must lead
to   that.   I   suppose   he   would   escape   that
conclusion by taking refuge in the old claim
of   the   divine   right   of   man   to   rule, a
 principle   common   in   government   in   olden
 times   but   rejected   by   most     enlightened
Christian thinkers of today.
His third reason for opposing full citizenship   to   women   was   a   psychological   one.
His  illustrations  clearly   led   to   the  inference   that   she   is   emotional   rather     than
reasonable; that that Indefinable something
called   &quot;Intuition&quot;   was   the   mainspring   of
her actions rather than a careful consideration of the facts In the matter.  I understood him to teach that she was &quot;sudden&quot;
in  her  decisions,   and  that  these  decisions
could not be affected by an array of arguments however strong; that she would cast
her ballot under the power of &quot;sentiment&quot;
without reference to the consequence of her
action-  But he gave no instance  that such
had actually occurred other than the suffragette demonstrations in London and also
in   some   American   cities,   in   their   effort 
to   secure   what   they   believed  to  be   their 
constitutional political  rights. If we admit 
that  these  militant  sisters  have   shown   a
high degree of excitability, it must be admitted that many a mob of male members
has committed acts of violence to the extent of destruction of property and the taking of human life in the most brutal manner.  If she has gone too far in her disregard of the laws of propriety,  he has certainly gone to a greater length in his disregard   for   law   and   government.   If   the
preacher  would  deny  the  right  to vote  to
women because they are emotional, he sure-
ly would deny it to men when in so many
instances they have been ruled by passion.
The psychological argument fails unless he
can show, and it fails until he does show,
that she has not the mental ability to grasp
the  affairs   of  state.   It  is   here   admitted
that many  women  could   not  give  a  clear
reason why we should or should not have
a   protective   tariff,   and   it  must   also  be
admitted that a large number of men—the
majority if you please who have voted for 
years,   could   not   give   a   clear   statement 
of their position.  If one  sex Is  denied the 
right because she is ruled by sentiment in 
some Instances, the other sex should be de- 
nied  the  right  because  in  some   instances
he has been ruled by passion.
His fourth reason was that the opposed
woman suffrage because it would be detrimental to the home. In perfect frankness
 and sincerity, if I thought it would be
 detrimental to the home, I would oppose it,
too, with all my strength. I heartily agree
with the preacher that in the home she is
queen. I would emphasize it as much as
he, and all who heard him remember how
he raised his voice on that statement. His
plea for the sanctity of the home. I think 
has never been excelled in beauty or in
power by any writer or speaker of the
English language. It was a most pleasing
expression of the loftiest ideals—ideals that
can be formed only by the pure in heart
after long experience and closest communion with the Most High. As he painted his picture of what the &quot;queen&quot; should
be in the home circle, I suppose every husband and father was filled as I was with
the striking similarity it bore to his own
fireside. That picture is the sweetest
known to any of us. The mother's influence on the little ones can be measured
only by a standard known to the councils
of eternity. That her mission in this world
is to mother a child and to minister in
tenderness commensurate with the delicacy
of his being, to his bodily wants and to
his mental and spiritual  growth as well,</dc:description>

<dc:description>OFF TO WASHINGTON TO
SEE SUFFRAGE PARADE

And Incidentally to Witness the
Inaugural  Ceremonies.
After weeks of strenuous planning
and preparation the suffrage crusaders
are now encamped in Washington,
awaiting marching orders. Monday at 3
p.m.  sharp, rain or shine, a grand army
of women will, for the first time, pass
down the historic highway, hereto held
sacred to masculine demonstrations.
Everything that feminine ingenuity,
patience and skill can devise has been
done to render this pageant-procession
the medium of a powerful appeal to the
intelligence, and sympathy of the thousands of spectators who will witness it.
Each feature has been designed with an
eye single to the advancement of the
great cause it represents. From the
classic pantomime and tableaus to be
enacted on the spacious plaza of the
treasury by society favorites and famous artists, to strains of interpretative
music—to the last remnant of oppressed
working women, the pageant will portray, in a series of vivid, living pictures,
the long dramatic story of woman's
struggle for freedom and justice, and
foreshadow the ultimate victory that is
destined  to crown her heroic efforts.
The installation of a new president into the highest office of the land will,
of course, be one of the drawing cards
of inaugural week, but this quadrennial
ceremony, it is. generally conceded, will
be a mere matter of moonshine compared
to the rival attraction presented by this
first national suffrage parade. For the
last week the clans have been gathering
from all quarters of the country—car
loads of women of every rank and condition and many nationalities, and fresh
relays are rolling in with every incom-
ing  train.
Tennessee has caught the contagious
of nation-wide enthusiasm and is to be
well represented by delegations from
each division of the state, not the least
among them being the party of women
from Fast Tennessee, many of whom
will take active part, in this epoch-making event.
The following telegram has been received by Mrs. French from the grand
marshal of the suffrage parade to be held
in Washington March 3:
The Tennessee delegation in Washing-
ton parade, March 3rd, will form at
2 o'clock, p.m., on South Capitol street,
between C and D streets under the
Tennessee banner, between South and
Texas.
Parade headquarters 236 Delaware
avenue. Northeast.
MRS.  KYARD C. BURLESON,
Grand Marshal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>FIRS (sic.) ADVOCATE OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS                                                                                                                        America's first advocate of woman's
rights was not one of the &quot;fair sex,&quot;
not an American, but an Englishman,
Thomas Paine. Among the earliest
writings of Paine we find him advocating more freedom for the &quot;gentler
sex&quot; and at the same time stating the
position of men in no uncertain light.
In one  place he says:
&quot;If we take a survey of the ages and
of countries we shall find the women
almost without exception, at all times,
and in all places, adored and oppressed. Man, who has never neglected an opportunity of exerting his
power in paying homage to their
beauty, has always availed himself of
their weakness. He has been at once
their tyrant and their slave.&quot;
Later on, recurring to women's
beauty, he writes: &quot;Even among people where beauty received the highest
homage we find men who would derive the sex of every kind of reputation.
The most virtuous woman,' says a
celebrated Greek, is she who is
least talked of. Thot(sic.) morose man,
he imposes duties upon women, would
deprive them of the sweets of public
esteem, and in exacting virtues
from them would make it a crime to
aspire at honor.&quot;
By far the most picturesque portion
of  his     article,     however,     is  that   in
which he gives what he considers
would be the defense of a woman. Al-
thugh over a century cid, this plea
might be given word for word and
still be in accord with the platform
orations of today. Paine makes her
speak  in this wise:
&quot;How great is your injustice? If we
have an equal right with you to virtue,
why should we not have an equal right to
praise? The public esteem ought to wait
upon  merit.   Our  duties  are  different  from yours,   but they  are     not
therefore  less  difficult to   fulfill, or of
less consequence to  society.    They are
the fountain  of your felicity   and  the
sweetness  of  life.     We  are  wives  and 
mothers.    'Tis we who form the union;
and  the cordiality of    families.       'Tis
we who soften that savage rudeness;
which considers everything as clue to
force, and which would involve man
with man in eternal war, and we cultivate in you that humanity which:
makes you feel for the misfortunes of
others, and our tears forewarn you of
your own danger. Nay, you cannot
be ignorant that we have need of
courage not less than you. More
feeble in ourselves, we have perhaps
more trials to encounter. Nature assails us with sorrows, law and customs press us with constraint, and
sensibility and virtue claim us with
their continual conflict. Sometimes
also the name of citizen demands from
us the tribute of fortitude.
&quot;When you offer your blood to the
state think that it is ours. In giving
it our sons and husbands we give move
than ourselves. You can only die on
the field of battle; but we have the
misfortune to survive those whom we
love most. Alas! while your ambitious vanity is unceasingly laboring
to cover the earth with statues, with
monuments and with inscriptions to
eternize, if possible, your names and,
give yourselves an existence when this
body is no more, why must we be condemned to live and die unknown?
Would that the grave and eternal forgetfulness should be our lot. Be not
our tyrants in all. Permit our names
 to be sometimes pronounced 'beyond
the narrow circle in which we live.
Permit friendship, or at least love, to
inscribe its emblem on the tomb
 wheme (sic.) our ashes repose and deny us
not that public esteem which, after the custom of one's self, is the sweetest
reward of well doing.&quot; 
Upholding the rights of women was
not   the   only   claim     which     Thomas Paine has to fame, and is perhaps the
one of which he is the least recognized.    It was his writings in connection
with the American and French revolu-
tions that gained for him a niche    in
fame's temple.
 Born at Thetford, Norfolk, England,
January 29, 1737, he was the son of a
staymaker and was brought up to    become    his father's    successor in  business. This, however, did not meet with
iyoung Paine's  ideas,  so   he  secured  a
position in  the    customs and also  be-
came   manager   for   a   tobacco   manufactory.    Even with these two sources
of income, however, he was not able to
keep out of debt, and 17 74 was dismissed. It was then that he came to
 America. Although he had done practically nothing in a literary way before
he began to write as soon as he had
settled here and it was in a Philadelphia magazine, in August, 177 5, when
he was thirty-eight years of age, that
the article on women's rights ap-
peared. 
It was in the following year that he
first earned recognition. This came
with the appearance of a pamphlet
entitled &quot;Common Sense&quot; in which he
set forth his views in regard to and
his advocacy of the cause of the colonies against the mother country. This
stand won him many enemies, but also
some friends, among them being
Washington and Franklin. Congress
also showed a friendship for him,
when at the close of the war he was
appointed secretary to the committee
on foreign affairs. In 1787 he went to
France and later to England, in both
of which places he won many influential friends. In the latter place, however, where he wrote &quot;The Rights of
Man,&quot; the enmity of the British government became so great that he was
forced to flee to France. Here he
again got into difficulties and was imprisoned and was only released at the
intercession of the American government. It was while he was in prison
that he wrote the paper on &quot;Deism,&quot;
scoring both atheism, and Christianity,
which brought forth such a storm of
abuse.
Returning to America in 1802, he
retired to private life, spending the
last years of his life at New Rochelle.
It   was   while   making a visit to New
York that, on June 8, 1809, he died in 
a   house   in   Grove   street. With only his landlady, her daughters and a 
Quaker   to follow the man who had
won international fame was buried a
short distance from New Rochelle. It
was several years before the grave was
even  noticed, but then a handsome
monument was erected on the spot.
When this was done, however, the
grave no longer   contained the remains
of Paine, as William Cobbett had previously removed them to England and
deposited them no one knows where.

<dc:description>WH0 WILL TAKE CARE
OF THE BABIES?
A Happy  Solution   of  a Very 
Troublesome Problem.
Miss Laura Clay in her recent lecture 
at Market Hall told a little story in 
refutation of the old charge that there 
would be no one left at home to take 
care of the babies if women went to 
the polls.
A  tourist,   it  seems,   wanting  to   get 
information  at  first  hand   in  regard  to 
the workings of equal suffrage in Colorado,   strolled  over  to   the  voting place
on  election day.    Presently two women
came along, each carrying a  baby, and
began  chatting with a pleasant looking
individual! of the male  persuasion,  who
stood at the door of the building.    After 
a round or two of merry banter, one of 
the   women   handed   the   man   her   baby 
and went into the booth to cast her vote.
When she returned, the child, in a state 
of high good humor, was restored to its
rightful  owner,   and  the  same friendly 
arms were held out to receive the other 
infant.      Whereupon   this   mother   also
went   into   the   booth   to   discharge her
duty to the state.
&quot;Who is that pleasant looking individ- 
ual that seems to have such a winning 
way with mothers and babies?&quot;' asked
the mystified tourist of a bystander.
&quot;Him;    Oh! that is one of the candidates,&quot; was the reply.
New Suffragette Stunt.
London, Fob. 7.—The suffragettes
have begun a campaign of cutting telephone and telegraph wires. 'Thirty telephone wires were cut today near Dumbarton, Scotland, and many telegraph 
wires between Birmingham and Coventry. Much inconvenience was caused by
the action of the suffragettes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>&quot;CONTRARY TO
GOD'S SCHEME&quot;
Dr. Len G. Broughton Speaks
on Suffrage.
Pastor   First   Baptist   Church
Declares Woman Should Not
Have Ballet,
Dr. Len G. Broughton, pastor of the
First Baptist  church,   in  delivering  his
Friday night lecture in Bible study there
to   an   interdenominational  study   class, fired a broadside  at the equal suffrage
principle, which, caused more than a stir
among the  body  of  students which he
was addressing.      The speaker said that
he   knew   he  was  not  touching  a   very
popular note in taking the position which 
he  was  convinced  was   right,  but   that 
he , nevertheless believed in the truth of
the  position   because   it   was   scriptural
and  that  he  believed  suffrage   for   women  was   not   in   accordance   with   the
ideas of the Creator.
&quot;Suffrage,&quot; said Dr. Broughton, &quot;for
women is contrary to the whole scheme
of God. He intended that man should
stand for woman. He intended that
woman should not stand by his side in
his responsibility for anything, but that
she should be by his side for protection.
However, much this may meet with the
disapproval of the people, it is my belief that placing such a responsibility
upon woman will bring her to ruin. All
the history of the past has proven it to
be so.
&quot;Wherever man in the past has been
given large responsibilities, he has been
given the strength with which to meet
them, such is the teaching of the Bible
from 'the earliest dawn of history, down
to the present time. God shows clearly that man should work for, plan for,
think for woman. I am opposed to it
first, because it is contrary to God's
revealed plan for the conduct of creation. Second, because it is contrary
to all historical teaching, and further
more it is contrary to all physiological
principles.&quot;
In explaining his position Dr. Broughton  said:    'I   am   enough  of   a   pacifist 
to believe that the ballot  must  be sup-
ported,  if need be by the bullet,  in or- 
der to enforce its meaning.     Outside of
any  Biblical convictions. I believe that
no   one  should  vote,   who   cannot   back
their vote with arms.&quot;
The lecture last night was on the
first book of Corinthians. The speaker
discussed it under four headings,
its introductory matter; second, its corrective criticism; third, its constructive
criticism, and finally, the closing words
of the book.
The purpose of the writings in First
Corinthians is to set forth the form
of church order not as to organization,
but as to inner life in the church, he
said. The letter sets forth the thought
that man is the head of woman, and it
was a digression on the modern application and misapplication of this principle, that caused Dr. Broughton to
speak his position on suffrage.
&quot; Next Friday night, he will speak on
the second letter to the Corinthians.
With the close of that meeting, there
will be no further meetings either of Dr.
Broughton's class or Miss Rule's class
and the Friday evening suppers will he
discontinued until after the Christmas
holidays.</dc:description>

<dc:description>AN OPEN LETTER TO THE
REV. LEN G. BROUGHTON
In The Journal and Tribune of Saturday, 
Dec. 2nd,  was reported a lecture delivered
by you to a Bible class, on the preceding
Friday evening.    For several reasons I am 
asking the indulgence of The Journal and 
Tribune for space to make a reply to your 
adverse criticism regarding equal suffrage.
The form of speech of which you make
use would seem to imply that you believe
yourself   to   be   an   authority   as   regard's
God's whole  scheme  in general,   and  His
intentions  concerning woman's  position   in
the human  family  in particular.    I  quote
from your  remarks as reported:—
&quot;Suffrage,&quot; said Dr. Broughton, &quot;for 
women is contrary to the whole scheme of
God, He intended that man should stand 
for woman. He intended that woman 
should not stand by his side in his responsibility for anything, but that she 
should be by his side for protection.&quot;
It  would  Seem  hardly necessary  to  re-
mind a Protestant clergyman of the twentieth    century that    as far    back  as  the
sixteenth century, Martin Luther led a cru-
sade against tyranny over the human mind. 
The triumph of protestantism assures the 
right of private judgment in religious mat- 
ters, to  every individual  where  its teach- 
ings are held in respect; though Roger Williams and the good Baptists of early America knew what it was to suffer under the
narrow bigotry of their religious neighbor.
But the framers of the constitution of the 
United States knew the impossibility of the 
finite comprehending the infinite and hav-
ing had experience as to the fallibility of
man's Judgment in earthly things,   wisely I
concluded  that  it was  hardly  likely   mere 
man   could  decide    positively    concerning 
God's schemes and intentions,    Our constitution therefore, virtually insures to every
individual freedom from religious dictation
and prosecution.
While our bodies may not be made to
suffer pain by decree of religious fanatics
it is still possible for weak minds to be
held in thraldom by the utterances of any
egotist who thinks his imaginings are at
one with God's Intentions. You may not
be conscious of any intention to tyrannize
over weak minds, so I take the precaution
of warning you of the danger of it.
You are reported to have said: &quot;God 
shows clearly that man should work for, 
plan for, think for, woman.&quot;
Unfortunately in times' long past many
men held this opinion and so interpreted
God's intention when it suited their 
convenience and gratified their vanity and con-
ceit. Especially do we find in comparing
the social conditions of men and women
that much objection was made to women
thinking and planning, but no obstacles
were put in the way of her working, if the
work were of an humble kind, and it could
be shown that it was principally intended
to be of benefit to some man or men.
Drudgery and all tasks that carried with
them no pleasure,  riches, power, honor or
glory,   have   always   been   freely   allowed 
to woman as carrying out God's intention 
as to the work proper to her sex.
Probably   the  best     examples    of  your
theory   that  God     does not    intend     that
woman should work, plan or think are to be
found In the harems of the Mohammedans.
The conclusion of the Moslem that women
have no souls is quite consistent with yours
that they were not designed by the Creator to
 think.    Every Individual  soul must 
think,  if a member of the human family. ,
To place woman in the non-thinking class 
is  to consign her to  the  animal kingdom. 
Primitive  man,     not having    developed !
great   intelligence,   naturally   placed   brute
force as the greatest human attribute.    He
despised the physically weak and made all
such his slaves.    Those men found it easy
 to make women subservient to them.    Not 
 even  clubs   were     necessary;   their   naked 
hands were sufficient    weapons to subdue
the females of the species- especially when 
they  were   with  child.
You,  who know so much of God's intentions,   probably  agree  with   me  that  God
intended motherhood to be woman's crown
of glory.    You  know enough  of the  social 
history of the human family,  and  I  hope
you are candid enough to confess that man
has  too  often  made  it  the   cause  of  her
degradation and misery.    Is this what you
would term man's protection of woman?
As  man  evolved in  the  course of time,
and   intellect   and   character   became   successful
 rivals  of physical  force,   woman's
condition was ameliorated, yet within the
recollection of many of us not yet a hundred years old, fiats have been put forth by
certain   male  egotists,   that  woman   could
not acquire  learning  equal  to  man,   or,   if
she   did,   it   would   be   at   the   expense   of
her health.    The regime which women have
passed through at the dictation of ignorant
men would seem to have been sufficient to
make idiots of them all.    The  only reason
why they have escaped this fate must be
because the all wise Creator has protected them until the man has sufficiently developed to recognize that he is not the special
favorite   of   Deity,   but   that   the   love   of
God is no less for His daughters than His
sons.
The God that I adore is the acme of jus-
tice, wisdom and love who endowed
with equal capacity man and woman.   As
the animals seem to have developed first 
so as to prepare the way for the human 
family, so the earlier development of man
to power and position would seem to be 
for the purpose of pointing the way to the 
mother of the race.
 Many women have been so dominated and 
suppressed by man's presumptuous egotism 
that their intellectual  development has been 
much retarded. It is this class that I fear 
may be influenced by your teaching and 
thus get erroneous view of God and His 
scheme and Intentions.
One other quotation I would consider
in    explaining    his      position,    Dr.
Broughton   said:    &quot;I  am  enough  of  a
pacifist to believe that the ballot must
be supported, if need be, by the bullet,
   in order to enforce its meaning.    Outside of any Biblican convictions, I believe that no one should vote, who cannot back  their  vote  with  arms.&quot;
Here speaks the primitive man.    Is brute
force the only power by which mankind is
to be controlled?    It is truly surprising the
little  real   influence  the   teaching  of  Jesus
has had on the so-called Christian world.
I ask you to consider that when the world
was governed by brute force the ballot was
unknown. The common people who did the
fighting did not cast a vote. Bullets and
ballots are not companions, but ballots in
the hands of the people are supposed to be
a substitute for bullets in the hands of
hired  agents,   too  often of  tyranny.
Thanks be to God that in giving woman
the crown of motherhood He made her the 
giver,  not the taker,   of life.    Woman  has
no greater claim to the right to the ballot
than that she is a producer and not a 
destroyer of life.    Much as I believe justice
demands   the  ballot   for   woman,   I   would
shopper to buy more than ever before, goes
a  long way  to  indicate  the  financial  success of the season, there being more money
in circulation this year than for many years
past.
Prices.
Despite
the much talked question of the
high cost of living and the appalling in-
crease in price of the actual necessities of
life, the wares appropriate to the holiday
season are to be had at approximately the
same prices that were quoted last season.

<dc:description>NATION RIDICULES
FAMOUS DIVINE
Says Anti-Suffrage Logic of Dr.
Lyman Abbott is Neat and Bewitching
Dr. Lyman Abbott, in his recently published &quot;Reminiscences,&quot;
expresses deep affection for his
wife, but says: &quot;She loyally supported my views, even when she
did not share them, and we were
of one mind.&quot;
The Nation of Jan. 27 comments on this point as follows:
&quot;How natural is Dr. Abbott's opposition to woman's suffrage!
Put into words, the argument lying implicitly beneath this statement would run somewhat as follows : The well-regulated man
and wife are of one mind, even
when they do not think alike, and
that mind is the husband's.
Therefore, it is sure of perfect
expression if the husband does
the voting. One may accept or
reject the conclusion, but the logical nea(missing) (missing)f the argument is
bewitch(missing) (missing)ny rate.&quot;

<dc:description>DELIVERED ADDRESS TO
EQUAL SUFFRAGE CLUB


G. Armistead Collier,    Jr.,    of Memphis, Was Heard      
Saturday.
W. Armisstead Collier, Jr., of Memphis, a close student of social and philosophical problems for a number of
years, addressed the Equal Suffrage
league at the home of the president,
Mrs. L. C. French, Saturday afternoon.
In dealing with the theme, &quot;The Future of Democracy,&quot;  the speaker said
that the  ideal  of society    is     human
brotherhood and that through all rec- 
orded  history the struggle  to this at-
tainment has been through the means
of establishing economic    justice    and
social  equality.     He    dwelt    at  length
upon the equalities of the present day, 
the  sufferings  of the  poor     in     great 
cities, the result of the exploitation of 
the working man,  and then described
investigations   of   Robert   Hunter   and
John  Spargo  in  New  York  with  reference  to  these  flaws  in  the  present
social fabric.
Such conditions as these, the speaker contended, are sufficient in themselves to condemn democracy today.
More than this, they have set the
brightest intellects of the country to
work on fundamental problems and to
strive to formulate as far as possible
a working theory for the reconstruction of society on a higher plane of
economic justice. Mr. Collier, in
speaking of the reformation period,
referred to Fourier and St. Simon,
naming as representative minds of later days Robert Omen, Ruskin and
Tolstoi. He made no recommendations (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>EQUAL SUFFRAGE LEAGUE
MEMBERS TO MEET 

Mrs.  L.  C.  French, president of the
Knoxville Equal Suffrage league will be
at home this afternoon from 2:30 to four
four o'clock, when members of the
league and friends are invited for informal discussion of the live questions of

&quot;The  Future of Democracy.&quot;
The meetings of the league are monthly, and the next regular meeting will
not be held until Saturday, February

In order that members who have more
time to give to a study of the questions
with which the league is concerned may
do so, the home of the president is to
be thrown open informally every Saturday afternoon. Mrs. French will either
lead the discussions or invite some person well informed to do so, and the
presence of Mr. Collier at this afternoon's meeting promises unusual interest. Mr. Collier is one of the best informed young men in the state and is
well known to most of her citizens. He
has lived for a number of years in New
York, which city is at present his home.
At the regular meeting last Saturday
afternoon, there was a general and spirited discussion on the need of good government
 along the  lines of birth registration,
 child labor and compulsory education.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Washington Disgraced by Hoodlums;
Suffrage Parade Marches Into History
&quot;The Ides of March have come and
gone and Ceasar's yet alive,&quot; which, being interpreted means that the great
suffrage pageant, so long in the planning, so arduous in the execution, passed
triumphantly down the disputed avenue
into the domain of national history on
March 8, 1913, in spite of the hostility
of the police force of Washington—and
the thousands of women who composed
its ranks every blessed one of them
still lives—-will push their cause forward to victory already within sight.
The memorable day dawned bright
and clear, and soon the city was aglow
with &quot;Miss Columbia's own particular
color&quot;—suffrage yellow floating in flags,
pennants and streamers, from every
available point and person. Even mother nature rallied loyally to the aid of
her daughters, and sent a flood of sweet
spring sunshine to temper the sharp
western winds, and by means of a
hurry order, brought to swift blossom
great masses of golden forsythia, daffodils and tulips, all quivering with excitement and with eagerness to lend enchantment to the momentous occasion.
At an early hour throngs of busy
women began to pour into the streets
and to hurry to and from headquarters
to   receive   their    marching orders and complete the last details of preparations.  At the appointed hour the grand
army of women, more than five thousand strong, with its hundreds of divisions, floats, chariots, classes, crafts, professions and orders, all symbolically
(missing)parisoned stood to attention.  At the
single blast of the chief herald Miss Inez
Millholland, the parade started from its
rendezvous at the base of the capitol,
while at the same moment the call which
set in motion the pantomime was passed
 on from herald to herald until it
reached the actors waiting on the plaza
of the treasury building. Beautiful beyond description was this allegorical
symphony in coloring and grouping,
which portrayed woman's struggle for
freedom and the final victory of her
cause throughout the world. Thus
ended the first glorious act of the pageant. Then tug of war, so to speak,
for in the meantime the great surging
masses of humanity that lined the street
had broken through the unguarded barriers.  And the pageant, which would
have been the most imposing spectacle
ever witnessed in Washington, was separated into fragments, halted at every
pace, and reduced to a single file line
struggling against, a crushing, ruffianly
mob that was fast closing in on both
sides, unrestrained, by the policemen
who stood idly by or joined in the scoffs
of the hoodlums. Seeing that the police were making no effort to clear the
route the marshals and heralds appealed
to the secretary off war, and soon troops
from Fort Myer were rushed to the rescue. Amid a wild burst of applause
from the stands the boys in brown
pushed aside the  (missing)aping policemen and
charged down (missing) side of the solid
walls of stubborn humanity and quickly
cleared the way for the undaunted suffragists who completed
 their triumphant
march to Continental hall, where the
proposed suffrage demonstration resolved
itself into an indignation meeting. Dr.
Anna Shaw led the meeting and opened
it with a scathing denunciation of the
officials who had disobeyed the explicit
order of congress and   failed to provide
the same protection for the women
marchers that is always furnished for
masculine paraders.    On motion of  Os-
wald Garrison Villiard, editor of the
New York Evening Post, this denunciation was embodied in the following resolution:—

<dc:description>STATE DELEGATIONS
JOIN PICKET LINE
AT THE WHITE HOUSE
Delegations from three states came
last week to take their place in the
picket guard stationed by the congressional union in front of the White House
to show the President that the women
of the country are waiting for him to
act on the federal amendment before the
end of the 64th congress.
Monday was District of Columbia day
as it is each week. Pennsylvania day,
Thursday the 24th, brought from that
state an enthusiastic group of women
eage[r] to stand sentinel all day till nightfall. They were, however, divided into
squads that served in regular turns until
four o'clock, when the whole long line
was stretched across the front of the
white house from gate to gate, reiter-
ating with their banners the question
that keeps the congressional union
standing guard, &quot;Mr. President, how long
must women wait for liberty?&quot;
The New York delegation on January
26 carried on their banners phrases from
President Wilson's book, &quot;The New
Freedom.&quot;
&quot;Liberty  is  the  fundamental  demand of the human spirit.&quot;
&quot;We are Interested in the United
States, politically speaking, in nothing but human liberty.&quot;
Twenty-four women came down from
New York to join the picket line on one
of the coldest and most blustering days
of  the year.    They  stood  staunchly  on
guard,   however,   wind-whipped  but   serene, calling the President's own words
to his attention when he came in late in
the afternoon.
Virginia day, Saturday, brought a
group of delegates who had made a long
over-night journey by boat and train to
prove that the women of this most conservative state are taking their part in
the movement for federal suffrage.
Plans are proceeding for the demonstration in which the picketing will culminate on March 4th.  At twelve o'clock
on that day President Wilson will take
the oath of office at the capitol. Mrs.
Robert Baker is arranging for a great
delegation of voting women, supported
by non-voters, to meet him after the
oath has been taken to protest against
his first term's having gone out without
action on the federal amendment and to
ask that he begin his new term by initiating legislation which will bring
about the passage of the measure.
Indignation Spreads.
In the meantime indignation was
spreading like a furious fire through all
classes of citizens and by morning Washington was ablaze with righteous wrath.
Advocates of the women took up their
case in the senate and the house, and
passed resolutions demanding an investigation of the shameful failure to furnish
the necessary guards. Already hundreds of letters, petitions and resolutions
from prominent people all over the country, have been received by Lieutenant
Hobson, who has constituted himself the
champion of the suffragists. Thus
ended the first national suffrage parade
so long in the planning, so arduous in
the execution. But as Dr. Shaw says,
if anti-suffragists, women or men, think
we are to be frightened by the unseemly pranks of a hostile mob they are very
much mistaken.
Many a great victor has come
through the back door of defeat, and
from this time forth we shall push our
cause more vigorously than ever, believing that the wreck of our pageant,
through the personal prejudice of a few
misguided officials, will turn the great
tide of public sympathy in the right direction and speedily usher in universal
suffrage.
White House Picket.
That the white house picket has be
come part of the vocabulary of the na-
tion is every day testified to. Humorists of all calibres are bursting into
verse over suffrage and drawing attention to the daily appeal to the President
in quarters which have never before
harbored the suffrage idea. At the New
York dinner of the Gridiron club, prob-
ably the best known press club in the
world—a dinner at which the President
of the United States was a guest—one
of the songs called &quot;Camping Tonight,&quot;
ran as follows:
&quot;We're camping    tonight    on the white
house grounds.
Give us a rousing cheer,
Our golden flag we hold aloft,
Of cops we have no fear.
Many   of   the   pickets   are   weary  tonight.
Wishing for the war to cease;
Many  are the chilblains  and frostbites
too;
It is no life of ease.
Camping  tonight,  camping   tonight.
Camping on the white house grounds.
It is, after all the serene good nature
of the white house picket that has made
friends. Through sleet and snow and
rain, in the face of criticism and rudeness and misunderstanding, the young
women have held their ground, to win
general acceptance, if not approbation,
from the very quarters where once disapproval came. The very white house
police on guard at the now-closed gates,
presents a smiling exterior.
Resolution of Censure.
&quot;Resolved,    That this meeting unqualifiedly   censures  and   denounces
the shameful conduct of the police
during the    suffrage    pageant  just
ended,  which denied to  the marchers for suffrage their rights to  parade freely  and  unmolested  in   the
main  streets  of  the    capital,    and
subjected them to frequent ribald insults   from   the   crowds   which   all
but  overwhelmed   them.     To   these
insults   the   police   in  many     cases
listened without effort to repress, as
they   were   but   mildly      interested
when the marchers were compelled
to go in single file.    Such mismanagement would have been a disgrace
in  any  city,  but it  is doubly    and
trebly  a  disgrace    in  the  national
capital,   which   belongs  to  our   citizens, men and women alike.&quot;
Dr.  Shaw continued her speech after
the resolution had been passed and said
there  was  consolation  in  the  fact  that
all the men who    insulted    the women
were anti-suffragists,  and that  anti-suffragist  policemen  made  no   attempt  to
stop the disorder.
Mrs. Shaw then complimented the
women on their behavior, saying she
had never seen greater dignity and coolness under exasperating provocations
than was displayed during these shameful occurrences which furnish the last
clinching proof of woman's need for
the ballot for the protection denied her
in all walks of life. And with a militant
note in her voice she urged the women
not to be dismayed by this wreck of
their beautifully planned pageant, for
this trifling defeat would appeal to the
justice-loving sense of the great American public and in the end serve as a
great and glorious victory by winning
new recruits and sympathizers. Mrs.
Shaw gave the warmest praise to the
suffragists of Washington, who had
handled everything within their province
with the utmost efficiency, and also
waxed warm in commendation of the voluntary bands of boy scouts who had
risked life and limb in their valiant endeavors  to  assist  the  women.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Women Meet In Debate Unique In Annals of Public Speaking.
Mrs- L Crozier French Presents
the Cause of Woman Suffrage.
Men Have Too Much and
Women Too Little Power,
She Declares.
In Governmental Affairs,
Women Only Pay Taxes and
Are Liable to Punishment
Under Man-Made Laws.
An audience that occupied all available space in the great auditorium at
the exposition gathered Thursday night
to listen to the debate on the question
of woman suffrage, in which the principals were Mrs. L. Crozier French, of
Knoxville, and Mrs. Annie Riley Hale,
of Rogersville. The former championed
the cause of equal suffrage, while the
latter voiced her reasons for being opposed to  giving the  ballot to   women.
Although the cause of equal suffrage
in Knoxville has been upheld on numerous occasions by earnest partisans, it
was the first time that the &quot;antis&quot; had
had an advocate on a local rostrum, and
the debate was one of the most interesting ever held here.
With rare skill, the speakers, two of
the best known women of the south,
marshalled their arguments, using all the
finesse of the trained public speaker,
and the results were most effective. Time
and again the speakers were interrupted by outbursts of applause, as they
made some telling point which impressed
profoundly the large audience, and they
were listened to with the closest attention.
No Decision Given.
Mrs. French opened the debate and
presented her side of the question in an 
address of about forty minutes, after
which the &quot;anti's&quot; with Mrs. Hale as
their champion, had their innings for an
hour and then the debate was closed by
Mrs. French in rebuttal. No decision
was announced, but last night's discussion of the question as to whether women should be allowed to vote was
heard by one of the largest audiences
that ever gathered for a similar purpose
in the south, and the supporters of both
sides of the question declared that they
were more than pleased with the meeting.
Seated on the platform in the auditorium were members of the Equal Suffrage club of Knoxville, well known club
women, members of the board of directors of the exposition and other well
known citizens. The audience was made
up of representative citizens, and al-
though the debate did not end until
10.30 o'clock, but few of those asembled
left the hall until Mrs. French closed
her rebuttal, so greatwas the interest in
 the discussion and the effectiveness 
of the speakers. The audience began to assemble about 
7:30 o'clock, and a little later the Ellery 
band took its place in front of the stage, 
and  for  more   than   an  hour,   rendered
excellent   music.     At   8:30  o'clock,   the
meeting  was called  to  order  by   T.   A.
Wright, president of the exposition, who
spoke briefly.    The  question of woman
suffrage,  he   said,   is   one  of   the   great
ones of the day, and, in fact, is of such
wonderful   magnitude  that  its adoption
for all the country would be the greatest step  for good or evil  taken  in the
United States in 500 years.    The question, he said, was up to the good women
of   the   day   to   determine   the   answer.
The   Knoxville   people,   he   said,     were
fortunate in having before them two of
the most brilliant women of  the southland to discuss  whether or not woman
should have the ballot.
The question for debate, as stated by
President Wright, was, &quot;Resolved, That
Women Suffrage Should Exist.&quot; Following the statement of the question, a
laugh rippled over the house when President Wright said that, when the debate
was over, the question would be settled,
and the great conservation for which
all have been striving, would have been
brought about.
Mrs. French was then presented by
President Wright, and was greeted with
a burst of applause. In opening her
address, Mrs. French said that she wished it were possible that she might address those in the audience as fellow
citizens, but that since she was not accepted by the United States, or by the
state of Tennessee, as a citizen, but
was ignored, except when it came to
paying taxes, and was punished by laws,
made by men, without her consent, the
best she could do was to say, ''Citizens,
and fellow servants.&quot;
&quot;As a patriot,&quot; the speaker continued,
&quot;I give way to none. There are various
ideas of patriotism. My idea is one of
love and reverence for the principles
upon which our government is founded.
Much do I honor and revere the principles of our government, which I hold
to be a government of the people, by
the people, and for the people.&quot;
The speaker then read the following
extract from the declaration of independence:
&quot;We hold these truths to be self-
evident,   that   all   men   are  created
equal;   that   they   are   endowed  by
this creator with certain unalienable
rights,  that  among these,   are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness;
that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men deriving  their just  powers   from  the
consent of the governed; that whenever   any  form   of  government   becomes destructive of these ends,  it
is  the right of the  people  to  alter
or to abolish it, and to institute new
government,   laying  its   foundations
on  such  principles,   and  organizing
its powers in such form as to them
as shall   seem  most likely to  affect
their  safety and happiness.&quot;
Another quotation was given from the
declaration of rights of Tennessee, and
the   speaker   declared   that   upon   these
she   would   base her  argument  for  the
enfranchisement of women.
&quot;Many ideas, said the speaker, had
been advanced as to whether all men
are born free and equal. Many hold
that they are not and that the rich
and the poor are not equal. I hold that
no government shall do aught to prevent
every human being born into the world,
having the right to have life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. Although
there has been a great hue and cry
about changing our constitution, the
makers of the constitution, the greatest
document ever penned by man, expected
it to be altered. Just as the clothing
of an infant is not suitable for the
child of twelve or fourteen years, so
may constitutions be outgrown. Our
forefathers knew that, and they thought
that  if  the  constitution  was  not  suita-
ble,   it   should   be
  changed
We have had all kinds of government in the world
for the duties of the latter,  and the two
ideas are incompatible.&quot;
Rivals Cheered.
Round after round of applause was
given Mrs. Hale as she resumed her seat
on the platform, and the handclapping
burst forth again as Mrs. French arose
to make her closing speech.
&quot;I am disappointed, but not surprised,
said Mrs. French, as the applause died
away. &quot;The antis 'have no arguments, so
how &quot;can they advance them? I gave you
some of the principles of government, and
yet you applauded the reflections of my
opponent upon some of those principles.
She told you of suffragists abusing men.
I have followed suffragists around the
country for thirty years, but I have never
heard of them abusing any men. Some
suffragists, in fact, have fathers, and some
have sons.   Suffragists do not abuse men.
&quot;Mv opponent distracted your attention
from the United States to England. It is
not necessary for us to go back from the
United States to England, as we seceded
from that country long ago. Only a small
part of the suffragists now in England
are militants. There are no militants here
now I can't say whether there will be,
or will not be, for I am not a prophet
nor the daughter of a prophet, but since
ten states now have equal suffrage, l
think that the enfranchisement of woman
in this country will be peaceably done.
There will be no great cataclysm, if women
are given suffrage, no great differences to
be noted in the boy after be casts his first
ballot.
Both Have Faults.
&quot;Men and women both have faults. The
former have two much power, and the latter have too little power. The enfranchise
ment of women would be better for them
for their homes, for their husbands and
their children. I don't know why men
should want the government over the
women. It is better for both men and
women to be friends and companions. The
newer a country is the higher women are
valued, that is one reason why suffrage
has spread so rapidly in the west, where
women are fewer and harder to get. In
some of these western states I'm going to
tell you of the results of equal suffrage.
In Colorado, ninety per cent of the territory is &quot;dry,&quot; and there equal
suffrage has prevailed for twenty
years.       California       is        also rapid-
ly moving to the &quot;rdy&quot;[sic.] columns,
while the same may be said of New
Zealand. If women control society, we
would have not prostitution, no white
slavery.    Prostitution   is a   natural consequence of the subservience of women.  I appeal to you to study this question as a principle. Women should not be subordicate to any one, she should be free.Not until you apply principles to thie question will you be ableto judge what is for the best.  Take the matter under serious
consideration, and
we  are confident what your verdict 
will  be.&quot;
Should Feel Complimented.
&quot;If greater pains were taken to safeguard the ballot, women might feel the
exclusion more. Under present conditions, women should feel complimented
without it. I am very thankful that
my self-respect does not rest on anything
so insecure as the ballot. The weak
male voter is the trump card in the
suffrage pack. The injustice of comparing the best women to the worst men
does not seem to strike the suffragist.
Because the electorate may be injured
by masculine unfitess, I can't see how
the question would be helped any by
adding a like quantity of female unfitness. Two wrongs do not make a right.
I fail to see how the matter would be
helped by doubling the amount of weakness or unfitness. It is well to say that
women should be informed about gov-
ernment matters, and they should, if
they had time and the informa-
tion about government matters, two
very big 'ifs.' How many would
have them? Would the bestowal of the
ballot change woman's tastes?  The ballot is an expression, not a university
extension, nor an education. To talk
of educating an ignorant woman by her
own ignorant ballot to me is very like
having a man lift himself by pulling on
his own boot straps. No anti-suffragist
could have a more superficial view or
idea of the ballot than the 'high-brow'
who speaks of running to the corner to
vote, as of running to the store on the
corner after some 'Uneedas,' or a pint
of pickles.
&quot;I hold no brief for the ignorant or
penal male voters. I think that they
should have a test to exclude unfit voters. It is a curious thing to me that
the women are always pointing to the
unfit male voters, but never ask for his
exclusion. However, she wishes to add
his wife, his sweetheart, his mother to
the number, I think it proper to leave
well enough alone. Women are more
unfit to vote than men, and a woman
of the same class in which the unfit
male voter is found would be even more
so. The personal note in the woman of
the world is inevitable. She has greater
preoccupation than man. Type for type,
class for class, there are many reasons
why women would be less intelligent
voters than men. The women should
devote their time, aside for their household and home duties, and others, to
recreation, and should not be bothered
with political troubles. There is another, a biological and psychological reason. A noted New York physician told
me that women inherently depend upon
man and were never so happy as when
they do. If you suffragists want to liberate women, liberate her from her own
slavish instincts. The net results of
giving the ballot would be to strengthen
the hand of the man boss in the political world. Suffrage got its first
stronghold in the Mormon states of Utah,
Wyoming and Idaho, and the corruption there in things political is well
known. If women haven't sense enough
to take care of themselves without the
ballot, they certainly would not have
sense enough to take care of themselves
with it. Any one saying that I need the
ballot would have trouble on his or her
hands at once. The following of the
men by women in politics is illustrated
by the story of the Irishman who, when
asked if he favored woman suffrage.
said yes, because since where he now
has but one vote, he would then have
six, having a wife and four daughters,
and thus would be a powerful man in
his district. An ex-senator from Idaho,
where they have had suffrage for twenty-
years, who was formerly a suffragist,
said that he had reversed his opinion.
The women there, he said, voted with
the men even in &quot;wet&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; elections. Since they are going to persuade
men to obey good laws, made by wo-
men why do not the women persuade
 them to make good laws? The great
 strategic advantage woman has over
man is that she makes candidates for
iboth sides, and if she makes them right,
 no election can go far wrong. Which
is the most important, to make laws, or
law makers? The foundation or the
superstructure? Social standards and
moral codes rest in the woman of the
world. No civilization over went ahead
of her. The mother has continuous association with the child in the first ten
or twelve years of its life, and if it
grows irreparably bad in after years,
generally there is something wrong at
the start. Women should pay more attention to the men they select to be the
fathers of their children. Whatever men
are, we can't fling stones at them, for
they are just what we make them. Man
has ever dominated woman in the world
of thought, and woman can dominate
man in the world of emotion and feeling
&quot;The greatest good to be derived from
the suffragist movement is that women
may have the right so long denied them as
seeing themselves as they really are. The
trouble with woman is not so much conscious violation as unconscious ignorance.
It is not more power that she needs, but
more light. Not the ballot, (missing)more responsibility that is needed. (Missing) a differ-

<dc:description>Mrs. Annie Riley Hale Gives
Reasons Why Women
Shouldn't Vote.
They Should be Mourning Neglected Duties, Rather Than
Seeking New Ones,
Women Get Same Protection
Under Laws as Men, and
Those Paying Taxes Do So
on Property Earned by Males
men who have, the feminists always
sight(sic.) the weakness of male voters, paying no attention to the strength of the
strong ones. Always, too, they compare
the weak men with the brilliant women,
clamoring for more and newer duties, the
newest woman should be on her face in
the dust, mourning the neglect of other
duties. (Much applause). Woman is able
to swing the world to her notion of
things, yet, ignoring these things, the
newest woman cries for the ballot much
as a spoiled child does for a new toy,
which it soon throws away. The actions
of militant suffragettes are like those
of the spoiled child, to a dot. These
militant suffragettes are so only by reason of the hysteria of disordered minds,
glorified vanity and inordinate egotism.
Those self-constituted martyrs, in addition to sacrificing themselves by hunger-strikes, prison sentences, etc., sacrifice the property and lives of others
and the evil becomes the more. The British
 suffragettes convict themselves of
having no sense of responsibility and no
 sense   of   proportion.       These     militant
 women   are   criminals,   though,   just   the
 same.</dc:description>

<dc:description>VOTES FOR WOMEN
To The Knoxville Sentinel.
The achievements of our splendid
manhood, the progress of our country
through the past 150 years rather justify the belief that even mere man
can be trusted to safely steer the ship
of state. Can not woman be content in
believing she has had a silent but none
the  less  potent influence  in  this?
I think I have always naturally and
instinctively opposed suffrage for
women, and my feelings on this issue
become stronger. My conviction is that
woman has her own special responsibilities—not necessarily confined within four walls—just as man has his, and
neither is fitted by nature to assume
that of the other. It is usually the
abnormal in either that seeks the field
of the other. It is not a question of
intelligence   but of fitness.
A prominent suffrage leader of the
city thinks one of the best things about
Knoxville is that no &quot;anti&quot; organization has  ever been able  to  survive.
Might this not be attributed to natural indifference rather than active
opposition?
I spent a year and a half in a western state, Idaho, a number of years
ago, I shall not say how many for I
was at that time old enough to vote
and in fact did vote rather for the
novelty of the thing, not believing then
that the south, particularly the women
of the south, would ever have or desire to have suffrage. The state had
then enjoyed (or endured) suffrage for
some years. I was not able through
those months to observe any particular uplift that the franchise gave
either to women or to the affairs of
state.    I think I studied rather closely.
There are many, many women who
feel as I do that this obligation must
be assumed when placed upon them
else they are failing in their duty. We
must keep ourselves well informed that
we may vote intelligently. The lack of
discretion or political intuition on the
part of some of the imported, suffragists in Nashville in attempting to deal
with men who represent us would lead
us to believe that women still need the
developing effect of another century of
political evolution. Many of the prominent and influential men of affairs do
honor to themselves and to their innate southern chivalry in so strongly
advocating the cause of suffrage. We
would not intimate that it might be
this, with some, rather than strong
conviction in the matter. The cry was,
&quot;Let us in, that we may purify politics.&quot; But watch us soon make a fifty-
fifty demand. Miss Paul, chairman of
the national woman's party, in speaking of last Wednesday's victory (?) has
this to say: &quot;Our victory will not how- 
ever be a signal for rest. Women have
still before them the task of supplementing political equality with equality in all fields.&quot; This will lead
women into work for which they are
entirely unfitted physically and otherwise, and they will at the same time
sacrifice forever that indescribable
fineness which has always set them
apart.
An incident while in Idaho on one
early gray morning I shot and instantly killed a large yelping coyote
 with a .22 rifle, in the sage brush a
standing behind a woman will  not
dodge when she throws a rock.&quot; &quot;We
must admit some advantages.
As far(sic.) me,   I must  still be  glad for
a heart full, and for hands full of work
that is far more satisfying to me than
any phase of the life political could (missing)
The lure   has  indeed  pass(missing)&quot;

<dc:description>WHAT'S IN A NAME?
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
with us today the Lucy Stone
League.
Don't know what that is? Neither
did we until yesterday. It's an organization, apparently with money
back of it for it is sending out
press agent stuff, and it has the cutest  little  object you   can   imagine.
Seems like some women up in New
York are convinced that the female
of the species has not been sufficiently emancipated and they have
started this organization to help
women retain their own names after
marriage. Wonderful, isn't it?
Such a beautiful thought! Such a
lovely way to devote ones energies
and ones money! It must indeed be
a blessed relief to turn from tea and
toodle to something so worth-while
as the work of the Lucy Stone
League.
Lucy Stone, it appears, was a
pioneer suffragost (sic.).. who married one
H. B. Blackwell back in 1855 and
in marrying said: &quot;My name is the
symbol of my own identity and must
not be lost&quot; and thereafter she had
some difficulty in signing legal
papers et cetera but finally won because nothing in law could be found
to prevent her continued use of her
maiden  name. 
Ruth Hale is the president of the
Lucy Stone League. Miss Hale is
the wife of Heywood Broun. It appears that Miss Hale applied for a
passport as Ruth Hale and the state
department insisted she apply as
Mrs. Heywood Brown. She would
not and she did not get the passport
but we are gravely informed that
under the pressure of the woman attorney of the Lucy Stone League,
Secretary Hughes will be forced to
hand down his opinion on this subject.
Now it occurs to us that it is
mighty hot weather to be fussing
about such triffles. If Ruth Hale
refuses to be called Mrs. Broun,
What the heck do we care, but why
try to set a lot of other women by
the ears about this matter?
Suppose all women should elect to
be called by their original names
after marriage, wouldn't a few complications creep in? Have a heart,
ladies, it's difficult enough to remember one name when introduced
to a strange and unheard-of couple
and if husband and wife should be
introduced separately under differ-
ent names, don't you see how immensely social burdens would be increased?
And what of the children, if any
and why so? Mr. Jones and Miss
Smith, being legal husband and wife,
have offspring. &quot;What name does
said offspring take, for certainly
Miss Smith, having such pride in
her name, never would consent to
having the little darling called Jones
and Mr. Jones, if he be any kind of
a father at all, will seriously object to anything but Jones. Maybe,
they could call him or her Jones-
Smith. But, suppose a Jones-Smith,
grown to maturity, should marry a
Brown-White, would the child of that
union be forced to bear four names?
The League says no, that the child
should bear the name of either the
mother or the father, the parents
agreeing at its birth.
After all, it make small difference,
in our opinion, what the Lucy Stone
League believes. But it does rather
strike at the foundation of civilization, the family, and the family,
heaven knows, has had many blows
delivered at it in recent years, yet
The Journal and Tribune has rather
abiding faith in the common- sense
of the great mass of the people and
such frills as that advocated by this
League are merely ripples on the
ocean of life, a cause for merriment
_____ of too much sadness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Popular Fallacy Exploded.                                                                                                                                                        Charles Lamb says somewhere in one
 of the delightful  &quot;Essays of  Elia&quot;  that
 nothing   flourishes   like   a   popular   fal-
lacy formulated out of the prejudice and
 inexperience of one generation and handed on  to  the next. A living illustration
 of  the truth  of this   saying is  found  in
that   sacred   syllogism   which was   born
of the  agitation  for    woman's      rights
sixty  odd   years   a go  and   has  regularly
been   going   the   rounds   in   every   state
campaign  for  equal   suffrage  ever since--
—namely,  -that  women  as   a rule don't
want  to vote.
That  they  will   not   and   do not vote
 when  given  the  ballot;
That  no  good   comes  of their voting
anyhow;
Therefore,   women   should not be en-
franchised.
Well,   let   us   see   what   the   facts are
in the case.
Statistics show that in the recent
presidential election when feeding ran
high and the dramatic situation aroused
the greatest feeling all over the country, only two out of every three men
voted., &quot;Local elections''—-to quote from
a recent editorial—&quot;rarely bring out
more than half the possible vote taking
the country  as a whole &quot;
This too when men in their personal ambitions are at stake and candidates have canvassed their respective
territories and made heroic efforts to
arouse their indifferent countrymen. But
when it comes to the enactment of
measures and amendments |he average
of the votes passed in the different
states usually falls to a comparatively
small fraction of this fractional vote
for candidates.
Are men ever arraigned for such negligence and disqualified as citizens?
Certainly not, and this fact ought in
common justice to render null and void
the solemn assertion that women ought
not to have the ballot because they
would not use it. It is a poor rule that
won't work both ways and citizenship as well as 
morals should be measured
by the same standard for both sexes.&quot;
It would not not be strange if a large proportion
of women born and bred in an atmosphere
 of political apathy should follow the
 lead of their men folk and fail
to avail themselves of their newly
rights, but figures prove that
this is really not the fact.
 Take the case of California for instance—which is only one among many.
When the campaign for equal suffrage
was on the state echoed(?) from end to
end with that old slogan of the Antis
that women wouldn't, couldn't and
shouldn't   vote.   But   when the   victory was won and the elections
came off it was found that while less than 20 per cent of the women had worked for suffrage, 90 per cent of them voted--the
women outnumbering- the men by a majority sufficient to turn the laugh
against the perpetrators, against that
old joke.
It is said that in all equal suffrage
states an average of 83 1-3 per cent of
the women vote. 
This record set over against   the   scant
50 per cent  average of  the  men  of  the  country   speaks  for
 itself.

HOW the women vote is another
story that deserves a chapter all to it-
self. &quot;A generally summing up of the
 evidence so far available&quot; says Mrs.
 Harper in the New York Times—&quot;shows
 that the women vote with discrimination,&quot;
and contrary to expectation are
not carried off their feet by personal
feeling  and  partisan   excitement.
Their campaigns have in all instances
 been  clean,   honest,   dignified  and  womanly
and they seem to have shouldered
their   new   responsibilities   in   the   same
serious, earnest spirit.  In  the  beginning
 of the movement the leaders sought the
support of  the  political     parties       that
were working for   the abolition  of slavery.
   But the  outcome  of the civil  war
 taught them  a  valuable lesson  and  established the  tradition that never again
should   there   be   an   alliance   with   any
political party.  Consequently,  the  move-
ment  has  been  absolutely  non-partisan,
and   in   all  states  in  which  equal   suffrage
  has   carried   the   credit   has   been
due,   not   to   any  one   party,   but   to   a
 union of the host element of all parties.
 For these  reasons the women's vote  is
 generally   independent   and   apt   to   center  on   the   man who    represents       the measures in which they are most inter- ested.
&quot;In matters of public policy,&quot; to
quote Mrs. Harper again, &quot;their vote
is inclined to be cautious and conservative&quot; but in local affairs, such as legislation that effects the home, the school
and the material and moral condition
of women and children their vote is
thoroughly progressive—not to say aggressive—as was the case in the re-election of Judge Lindsay by the women
of Denver in defiance of party bosses.
A similar instance was the quick action
of the newly enfranchised women of
Washington in overturning the corrupt
government of Seattle and purging that
plague ridden city of conditions almost
incredible.
These dramatic victories—by the way,
together with the exemplary action of
California in enfranchising her daughters last year, have had the effect of
lifting the movement from its tentative experimental stage to the domain
of practical politics. The addition of
three new states to the white list—one
might as well say four, for the victory in Michigan is a foregone conclusion—has given the cause an impulse
that brings it abreast of the other vital
issues of the age. and  forces politicians
to  recognize   it  as  such   and   give   it   a
place  in their platforms.
But to return to the point in hand—
nothing succeeds like success, we are
told, and theoretical arguments for
women's suffrage are not half as convincing as the proof of its practical
accomplishments. This was the theme
of a most able defense of the cause recently made before congress by Representative Taylor of Colorado, in refutation of this very charge that no good,
results are directly attributable to the
political  power of the  women   voters.
In the course of his speech Mr. Taylor enumerated no less than 150 valuable and progressive laws which stand
to the credit of Colorado women. These
are too numerous to mention here, but
this speech was made a public document, placed in the libraries and sent
out to thousands of people, besides being
used extensively in propaganda work by
equal suffragists, so that all who doubt
may read. Other states are pointing,
with pride to similar legislative records,
some longer, some shorter, but all in
the interest of social betterment. Madame Aino Malmberg, the distinguished
Finnish novelist and patriot who has
been giving a series of lectures in
America tells a thrilling story of the
wonders accomplished by her countrywomen since their enfranchisement in
1906, which by the way was unanimously conferred upon them by a grateful
government as a reward for their services and sacrifices during the dark days
when Finland was struggling to throw
off the galling bondage of Russia. In
the six years of their political power
the women deputies have proposed more
than one-tenth of the entire number of
bills—all of them dealing in a practical way with questions of education,
sanitation, health, social purity, child
labor, factory supervision, prostitution,
maternity insurance, care and education
of poor children, and a host of similar
policies.
In New Zealand, which is said to possess &quot;the best system of government
under the sun,&quot; the women have a free hand and
the men are proud to give them a 
a generous share of the credit for their
model republic. And so it goes.
Everywhere that equal suffrage has
been &quot;tried the results have been astonishing even to its most optimistic advocates, which proves that women want
to vote, do vote and that to some purpose when given the chance. They have
succeeded in doing what, so far, the
men have failed to do—raised questions
of social and moral significance to  a
level with political and commercial issues. And yet when any new effort is
made to extend women's suffrage the
same old fallacy is brought into requisition and worked for all it is worth. A
significant fact which may be noted in
this connection, is that the opposition
invariably comes from the same source
—from the professional politicians, the
masters of the &quot;machine,&quot; the promoters of graft and corruption, the protectors of commercialized vice and the
liquor traffic—in  short, from the worse
element of the country, which spares
neither pains for expense to defeat the
cause-—as was plainly shown in the recent campaigns in Ohio and Michigan.
The protest of these opponents no matter how artfully clothed in deceptive
language, really means &quot;women shall
not vote as long as we have the power
to prevent it, for we know that their
ballots will be cast on the side of civic
righteousness and our little schemes
will   suffer in  consequence.&quot;
The day of this corrupt domination
is waning and &quot;votes for women&quot; will
hasten   its  passing.
S.   H.  HOOD.

Suffrage in Morristown

The Morristown Equal Suffrage league
is growing so rapidly, and has become
one of the important leagues of the
state, and our members have begun to
ask the question when was interest first
manifested in the question of equal suffrage. One of our staunchest members,
Mrs. M.A. Hodges,, was a firm believer
 in equal suffrage more than half a
 century ago. She was the first woman
in Morristown to  take  the  position that
woman should have the ballot. She
espoused the cause when it was very
unpopular.  She was also the-first woman to work in an office in Morristown.
Her maiden name was Mary Anzaline
Witt, daughter of Coleman M. Witt,
and she worked in her father's office
helping him with all his different kinds
of work. He had charge of the express
business, was postmaster, and also depot.
All this work was carried on in
one building. Morristown was a very
small place at that time, and the work
was much lighter then than now. Still
it was a responsible position and took
care and judgment to transact all the
business.  Often Mr. Witt was sick, and
his daughter took entire charge of the work,
merely employing a colored man
to do the heavy lifting for her. She did
 this work for about two years, beginning
in 1860 and continuing until some time in
1862. About this time she married
Capt. James C. Hodges. She continued
to stay in her father's office some time after her marriage.
Mr. Witt had to give up his office
when the federals took charge of this section
  of  East  Tennessee during the civil war.
When the constitutional  amendment
came up to give prohibition to the state of Tennessee, 
Mrs. Hodges, in company
with some  other good  women,  went  to
the court house and worked all day on
election day.     They   offered   tickets   to
the voters, said tickets favoring the pro-
hibition   amendment.     Each   man   who took
a   ticket  was   entitled   to  a   good
dinner served  by   these  women.     Many
men   responded   to   the   invitation     and
voted for the amendment.    If the vote
had   depended   on East   Tennessee,     it
would have carried, but it was defeated
in   Middle  and   West   Tennessee.     Mrs.
M.   A.   Hodges  allied   herself  with  the
W.C. T. U., and was an active member of
that organization for some years. She (missing)
offices of president and record-
ing secretary at different periods. Capt.
Hodges   sympathized with his wife in
her views on woman suffrage, the two
being great believers in the ballot for
women and the prohibition of the liquor
traffic. These two have been great influences in molding the thought of the
town. Capt. Hodges is dead now, but
his influence  is still felt.
Mrs. L. Crozier French is one of the
pioneers of the woman movement in the
state, and she has never hesitated to express her opinion on woman suffrage.
She has talked and lectured all through
this part of the country.  Over twenty
years ago she came to Morristown and
lectured in the M. E. church South, and
the pastor, Rev. R. N. Price, was so
delighted with her views and her boldness in expressing them at this period,
that he asked her to occupy his pulpit
on the following Sunday night. She
said:
&quot;Are you in earnest?&quot; and on receiving an affirmative reply, she agreed to
preach and did so. She took for her
text: &quot;Gen. 3-15, And I will put enmity
between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
his heel.&quot;' She showed in what respect
woman had  bruised  the serpent's  head,
and in what she had failed. She brought
out clearly the thought that woman without the ballot was handicapped in making war on all criminal and vicious interests, and showed that her failure to
bruise the serpent's head was largely due
to the fact that she was not armed with
the right kind of weapon.  It was woman
suffrage all the way through, and Dr.
Price has often remarked that it gave
offense to no one. Everybody was
pleased.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN TO PRESS POLITICAL FIGHT
Republican and Democratic Organi-
zations Prepare to Renew Their Efforts.
There was a marked difference in   the 
atmosphere pervading the women's demo-
cratic and the women's republican head- 
quarters yesterday.   The democratic women
were at their desks early, and stayed 
late.    And they wore a cheerful smile.
  At   the   headquarters   of the   National
Women's Campaign Committee of the Re-
publican  National   Committee,   at No.  511
Fifth avenue, it looked as if nearly every-
body had moved out.    Few were at their
desks, and those who were there left early.
Their expressions were as dreary as the
deserted rooms, which a few days ago were
seething with enthusiasm and excitement.
The   democratic   women   have   called   a
meeting thus afternoon at five o'clock at
house of Mrs. Henry Morgenthau, No.
20 West Seventy-second street, to form a
permanent  organization.   Mrs. Mary Ware Dennett, 
 the executive   secretary   of   the
Women's Bureau of the   Democratic National Committee, which has-contributed a great
deal to the campaign, said a  state-
ment would be given out then announcing the
progress   made   by   the   bureau    and that
the organization would be definitely formed 
 to work for democratic principles and
candidates.
Mrs. Dennett had this to say about the election:_
tion:—
'President Wilson has put the Wall
street lobby out of business, a feat that
no other President of the United States
has accomplished. The officers and mem-
bers of our bureau are entirely satisfied
to-day that election returns give adequate
proof of justification for their policy,
adopted early in the campaign—'get the
facts to the voters; their common sense 
will do the rest.' &quot;
Refusing to admit, that they are worsted,
the republican Women also are preparing
to renew their efforts politically. Miss
Helen Varick Boswell, director of the National Women's Campaign Committee,
said, in regard to the probable election of
Mr.   Wilson:—
&quot;Republican   women    are    disappointed
but not dismayed at the result of the elec-
tion.   Seeing the need for education in
principles of the republican party in the
home, in the State and in the nation,
National   Women's   Republican   Associa-
tion will make greater effort than in the 
past to be the educational medium of
republican principles.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>DOES THE CONSTITUTION
PROHIBIT WOMAN SUFFRAGE?
AN OPINION BY JUDGE HENRY B. GIBSON.

The question is: Can the legislature constitutionally give women the right to vote? 
It was decided by our supreme court
nearly one hundred years ago that our
&quot;legislature can do all things not prohibited
by the constitution of this state or of the
United States.&quot; Bell vs. Bank, Peek, 269.
&quot;This is a fundamental rule of construction
in all the states.&quot; Cooley's Const. Urns.,
87:  and no court controverts it.—
Suppose, then, the legislature should pass
a law giving women the right to vote, and
the supreme court were called upon to decide whether the law was constitutional,
what would be the first question asked by
the court? In Cooley on Constitutional
Limitations, page 88, it is said, &quot;In inquiring whether a given statute is constitutional it is for those who question its validity   to   show   that   it   is   forbidden.&quot;
Does, then, the constitution of our state
forbid woman suffrage? It does not. The
constitution says, (Article IV, Sec. I.).:
&quot;Every male person of the age of 21 years, and a resident of this state for 12 months,
and the county wherein he may offer his
vote for 6 months, next preceding the day
of election, shall be entitled to vote.&quot; Now,
can any fair minded person say that this
language forbids the legislature to give
women the right to vote? It does not forbid the legislature to grant the right to
vote to any one.
It will be seen by the foregoing sections
of our constitution that it does not leave
it to the legislature to decide who shall
not vole. The constitution takes it upon
itself to determine that &quot;every male person of the age of 21 years, a resident of
the state for 12 months, etc., shall be entitled to vote;&quot; and forbids the legislature
to &quot;deny the right of suffrage to any (such)
person, except on conviction by a Jury of
some infamous crime.&quot; Art. I, Sec. 5. But
note that the constitution, after declaring
that &quot;every male person, of the age of 21
years, etc., shall be entitled to vote,&quot; does
not declare that nobody else shall ever
have the right to vote, and does not forbid
the legislature to enlarge the right of suff-
rage. It is silent on this matter; and, as
under the rule of construction laid down
above, the legislature can &quot;do all things
not prohibited by the constitution of this
state or of the United States,&quot; the legis-
lature  can  enlarge  the   right  of  suffrage;
can, for instance, confer it on male persons
of  the age  of 20 years,   or of any  other
age; or may confer it on women.
In  short,   the legislature may pass  any
law it chooses on the subject of suffrage
provided it does not deny suffrage to &quot;male
persons of the age of 21 years &quot;
The legislature that preceded the convention that framed our constitution had
passed various laws whereunder many
white men, of the age of 21 years, citizens
of the United States, and resident of this
state for 12 months, were denied the right
to vote; and the principal purpose of that
convention was to enfranchise the white
men of the state, and to prohibit the legislature from again denying them the right
of suffrage. See Caldwell's History of the
Constitution, 296. Had the constitutional
convention of 1870 wished or intended to
forbid the legislature from allowing anybody to vote but &quot;male persons of the age
of 21 years,&quot; it would have been an easy
thing to have declared in the constitution
that no other persons shall ever be allowed
to vote. But this was not done, and, as a
result, the liberty was given to the legislature to enlarge the elective franchise in
any way they saw fit, provided they did
not interfere with the voting rights of male
persons of the age of 21 years.
Some opponents of female suffrage contend that the subject of votes for women
was not in the mind of the convention
when the constitution was written, in 1870.
That may be true, but it proves nothing
so long as the convention did not in any
way prohibit female suffrage. Many laws
have been enacted since 1870 that were
not in the mind of the convention that
framed the constitution; for example, our
various strenuous prohibition laws, the
laws whereunder various officers may be
removed on petition of citizens, the primary election laws, the law giving the
chancery court jurisdiction of cases triable
in the circuit courts, and many others, all
of which were bitterly fought upon the
ground that they were not authorized by
the constitution. But our courts replied
that it was not material whether these
laws were authorized, the question was
Whether they were forbidden by the constitution, as the legislature had power to
pass any law it was not forbidden to pass.
The constitution creates a great many
offices for the state and counties, and
their various subdivisions, all that the convention thought would be needed: but, as
the constitution does not forbid the creation of other offices, the legislature has
created many others, most of which have
been promotive of the public welfare, and
some of which were vainly objected to on
the very same grounds that woman suffrage
is objected to, to wit, that the constitution
did not authorize the legislature to create
them, ignoring the great fundamental rule
that the legislature can do anything in
the way of legislation that it is not forbidden to do; and it is under this same
rule that the legislature can grant woman
suffrage
And so we get back to the point front
which we started: Is the legislature forbidden to pass a law giving women the right
to vote? We have already fully shown that
there is not a line or a word in the constitution forbidding such a law. It follows
then, as a legal demonstration, that as woman suffrage is not forbidden by the constitution, a woman suffrage law would be
fully within the constitutional power of
our legislature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>CHATTANOOGA suffragists have not
appointed delegates to the state convention at Knoxville, Oct. 28-30, but it
was said yesterday that this matter
would likely come up at the next meeting of the local league. This year Nashville will send twenty delegates to the
state meeting and the trip will be made
in a special coach decorated with the
suffrage colors. At each station &quot;votes
for women&quot; literature will be distributed. Memphis will also send a big
delegation. Last year Nashville, Memphis and Chattanooga each had ten representatives at the meeting and the increased number of delegates from the
capital city is evidence of the rapid
growth of that body. Mrs. L. Crozier
French has announced that a number of
prominent suffragists will appear on the
program, among them being Miss Alice
Paul. Mrs. Medill McCormick. Miss
Kate Gordon and others of equal note.
The social features of the state convention are numerous and the plans include several big affairs including a public reception at the Hotel Imperial,
where the delegates will be entertained
by the Knoxville league. The league
at Franklin will be the baby association
of the state at the convention. This
league was organized last week by Mrs.
Guilford Dudley, president of the Nashville forces.

<dc:description>EQUAL SUFFRAGISTS HAVE
ENDED THEIR CONVENTION
Resolutions Adopted by Faction of Which Mrs, French
is Presdent (sic.),
The annual convention of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage association was
brought to a close Friday afternoon 
when the faction of which Mrs. L. Crozier French is president, adjourned sine
die. The faction of which Mrs. James 
McCormack is president, adjourned Fri
day morning.
It  was voted by Mrs.  French's faction
to donate the sum of $200 to the national 
suffrage   convention,     which     meets     in
Nashville  Nov.   12 to  17.
The city of Knoxville was thanked   by 
rising vote for  its  hospitality  and   kindness,   and  resolutions   of  good  will   were
adopted   as  follows:
&quot;Resolved, first, that a hearty vote of
thanks be given the Knoxville Equal 
Suffrage league and its friends for their
delightful entertainment of the convention of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage
association of 1914, among which we
mention especially Mr. William M. Epps,.
Mr. Joseph S. Monday, Mr. Wm. Eugene Monday, who with their handsome
cars met belated trains with good humor,
handled weighty suit cases with chiv-
alric courtesy, and with celerity conducted the delegates to various points of
local and historic interest; also a number of the members of the Board of
Commerce who were so generous with
their cars; also the ladies of the Ossoli
circle for their most enjoyable entertainment  of the delegates.
&quot;Resolved, second, that the Tennessee
Equal Suffrage association extend a message of all good will, hopes for successful work, and harmonious relations to all
organizations endorsing the cause of
equal suffrage in  the state of Tennessee.

<dc:description>The Future of Woman
Suffrage
The result of the recent election will
be taken as positively settling for the
time being at least one of the questions
relating to woman suffrage. The platforms adopted by the two parties at the
opening of the campaign were similar in
sentiment if not in language. But the
republican nominee went much further
than his democratic competitor.
Judge Hughes came out in his campaign for an amendment to the national
constitution. President Wilson when the
question of woman suffrage was up before the voters of his state went from
Washington to his home and voted for
woman suffrage; but he is known to have
opposed an amendment to the national
constitution in favor of woman suffrage preferring that the matter be left
to settlement by the states.
The   re-election   of   President   Wilson
'&quot;will be taken as an endorsement of his
position   and   whatever  effort   is  to   be
made in the next four years will have to 
be  made  in  the  states  themselves  and 
not   in   the   general   government.     This
would seem to render useless one of the
well known  organizations of  women to
advance  the  cause of  woman  suffrage,
that known as the Congressional Union.
The purpose of the Congressional Union
is that of bringing to bear influence on
members of the national congress looking
to the adoption of an amendment to the
national constitution.
As already suggested the election of
Wilson committed to the doctrine of
states rights in the matter as he is, and
the defeat of Hughes who was avowedly
in favor of amending the national constitution settles the question for four
years leaving it to the states as it has
been here before.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMAN  SUFFRAGE.
This week the national capital has
had the advocates of woman suffrage
present in force. By their numbers
and speeches they have endeavored to
inject some spirit into a campaign that
has lagged for several years past. Senate and house committees have given
them a patient and respectful hearing,
without any prospect that the granting
of the proposed reform will follow with
a precipitate haste.
From the viewpoint of these advocates, the lines written by an American
lawyer-poet, William R. Wallace, have
no basis in reason or fact. Wallace,
who perhaps wrote poetry for a living and practised law for pleasure,
penned these often-quoted lines:
&quot;For the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rules the world.&quot;
It is difficult really to see what woman has to gain by privileges and pow-
ers additional to those already possessed.    In  the three  factors  that  control
 modern civilization her position is pre-
 eminent:  home, church, and school. This
 is to say that her spirit directs in their
activities.    As to the home, there will
be no dispute as to her control.  While,
in church, she does not fill the pulpits
or,   in   the   main,   the   administrative
offices, its internal affairs and religious
status    are    governed    almost    solely
 through her initiative and according to
 her  ideals.    In  school,  nine-tenths   of the  education  imparted  to  the  young
of the land comes through   her as the
teacher    and    guide.    For real power
and   helpful   service,   it   is   impossible
to think that better    opportunities and
wider  avenues  could  be  offered     and
opened.

<dc:description>Instances were related of a married
woman working to support herself and
family and worthless husband. She
had saved $500 which she placed in
the bank and just before election her 
husband drew it out and went on a 
spree, using his wife's hard earned
money for a jollification. Another instance was told of a woman who owned
the homestead. Her husband urged
her to sell it and buy a larger one.
She was satisfied and refused, but
finally his persuasion and persistence
ruled and she sold it. He secured the
money and left the city and has not
been heard of since. The law protected her real property but not her personal property, and her ignorance left
her at the mercy of her unscrupulous
husband.
The first thing necessary is &quot;education and a knowledge of the laws and
the league intends to begin at the be-
ginning, first studying the laws and
then devote their efforts towards having the most unjust ones changed or
repealed.
Women now have complete suffrage
in four states, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and Idaho. They have municipal suffrage in Kansas; school suffrage
in twenty-six states and territories-
taxpayer's suffrage in four states, but
Tennessee is not included in any of
these.
In New Zealand, Australia and Finland all women have same voting
privileges as men. In Norway they
have complete suffrage with slight
property qualifications. In Great Britain, Sweden, Iceland, they vote for
all officials except members of parliament. In Canada they have school and
municipal  suffrage.
An effort will be made to first secure a school and taxpayers suffrage
and municipal suffrage. Petitions on
these points will be framed and read
at the next meeting and generally discussed.
These are points that should interest all men and women who are interested in good government. It is
hoped that a large attendance will be
present at the next regular meeting
when these practical points of general
interest, will be discussed.</dc:description>

IN THE INTEREST OF VOTES FOR WOMEN
THE KNOXVILLE EQUAL SUFFRAGE LEAGUE.
Edited by Emma Farrand Tyler.
One of the bitter objections made by
a  southern   representative   in  congress 
against   the   passage   of     the     federal
amendment was—woman's ignorance.
 &quot;Heaven knows there are enough
ignorant voters now, without bringing
to the electorate a lot of ignorant women,&quot; is the war cry of Mr, Bailey, who
has made himself notorious as a man
whose  vision  is  very limited.
It is true that there are too many
ignorant voters; there are many igno-
rant women who may be made voters.
But have we not noticed that as soon as
(and before) a new duty arrives for
woman those who have kept pace with
its progress are ready to assist those
who are ignorant of its full exercise?
The recent victory in New York has
brought forth eulogies from many leading journals on the splendid and masterly organization of women, who conducted the campaign, eliciting the surprise and admiration of well known leaders in political life. And this is equally true of much other work that has
been taken up by women in the winning
of suffrage.        
The Woman Citizen had no sooner
announced the New York victory than
A Study Outline Appeared, one portion
of which, by Henrietta W. Livermore,
follows:—
The four topics (1) Citizens, (2) Voters,
(3) Necessary Steps, (4) Elections will
be expanded into a series of articles to
be published in later issues of the
Woman Citizen.
Each topic lends itself to further ex-
pansion so as to take in an exposition
of our different governmental forms (1)
Citizens and Naturalization being derived from the national government
leads to a study of the national government. (2) Voters, being subject to state
qualifications, to a study of the state
government, (3) Counties could be considered with the &quot;necessary steps,&quot; and
(4) Elections, being held in local districts, could lead to a study of local town
or city government. This plan will
be followed in the Woman Citizen.
Specific and definite duties might be
the outgrowth of these, studies. Committees to carry on such work could be
formed such as (1) Americanization Com-
mittee, (2) Committee to follow State
Legislation, (3) Committee to follow the
local council and local court, (4) Committee to organize and educate the woman  voters.
From such a study and such schools
as have been outlined, a group of women, trained to go out and teach others
should b- one concrete result. Thus an
education in voting essentials could be
carried to civic centers, to community
meetings in school houses, to existing
societies, to groups of women of differ-
ent spheres, localities, customs and
languages, to the end that What Every
Woman Voter Should Know may be
carried to Every Woman Voter.
I   CITIZENS.
First  Lesson.   
1. Who Are  Citizens?
U. S. Constitution Fourteenth Amendment.
&quot;All persons born or naturalized in
the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States and of the state wherein
they  reside.&quot;
This means men, women and children.
2. Rights of Citizens.
U. S. Constitution Fourteenth Amendment.
&quot;No state shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United
States; nor shall any state deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process of law; nor deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.
Basis of representation shall be reduced if right to vote is denied male
citizens. Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2.
Right of citizens to vote shall not be
denied on account of race or color. Fifteenth Amendment. (See Morse, p. 64,
ABC Government, for Rights of Federal Citizens and Rights of State Citizens.)
3. Naturalization,
By Federal Statute, not State.
U. C. Constitution, Article 1, Section
8, part 4.
&quot;The congress shall have power to
establish an uniform rule of naturalization.&quot;
Qualifications for naturalization of
men and unmarried alien women, the
same.
Five years' residence, not less than 2
nor more than 7 years' wait between
taking out first and second papers.
Speak English.
Understand the principles of our government.
Take oath of allegiance,
Be of good character.
4. Citizens by marriage.
A married woman's citizenship follows that of her husband.
If husband is alien, wife is alien,
whether American born or not.
If husband is American, wife is American citizen whether American born or
naturalized or not.
If husband is naturalized, wife is
American citizen whether American
born or naturalized or not. (For this citizenship of widows see Boyd, M. S. In
Woman Citizen, January 5, 1918.)
&quot;Any woman who is now, or may
hereafter be married to a citizen of the
United States, and who might herself
be lawfully naturalized may be deemed
a citizen.&quot; (U. S, Revised Statues. Section 1994.) 
In New York state, when a woman is
a &quot;citizen by marriage&quot; she must have
lived in the United States 5 years as a
state qualification for voting.
5.    Americanization.
Citizens by marriage need education
In American ideals, government, lan-
guage and customs. This work is a
specific duty of women voters as well
as a war measure. (See &quot;Watch your
Vote.&quot; Americanization Com. of N. Y.
S. W. S. Party, 303 Fifth Avenue, New
York City.)&quot;
It would be interesting to know how
much the average male voter knows
about the condition, and whether he
considers that knowledge of much importance as a member of the voting
class.
Intelligent women are awake to their
own needs and to those of their less intelligent sisters, whom they are already
assisting, in assuming this great responsibility.  We feel that it is solemn
trust about to be given us.     E. F. T.
Historically this amendment was pre
ceded by Article XIV, Section 2, which
attempted indirectly to give the franchise to male negroes in respect to federal officials and legislators by providing that representation in congress
should be reduced in the same proportions as the number of male citizens
twenty-one years and over, denied the
franchise by a state bears to the whole
number of male citizens of voting age
in that state.
The conferring of civil rights is another matter, for on the one hand many
civil rights are conferred by the state,
and on the other, both federal and
state governments confer many civil
rights on citizen and resident alien alike.
It is because of these three classes of
civil rights that the civic books are so
unsatisfactory in their definitions of the
world citizen. &quot;Citizens,&quot; says one premier, &quot;are all the people, men, women
and children, who live in one place.&quot;
&quot;Citizens&quot; says the ordinary person, going to the other extreme and including
all possible citizens' rights, &quot;are voters.&quot; &quot;Citizens,&quot; we may say, leaving
out the political or &quot;active&quot; group and
limiting ourselves to &quot;passive&quot; rights,
&quot;are those who have full civil rights in
the United States and in the state
wherein they reside.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>In The Interest Of Votes For Women
THE   KNOXVILLE  EQUAL SUFFRAGE LEAGUE.
Edited by Emma Farrand Tyler.
VICTORY IN TENNESSEE
At last the Tennessee legislature has followed the example of 26 other states, and
conceded to women the right to vote in
presidential and municipal elections. The
members from Knox county as usual were
solidly for the measure, it would seem
East Tennessee leads the states in the
march of progress. Senator Houk has always advocated the woman's cause and
now Senator Patten has proved equally
as good   a friend.
Women in the 1920 Election
The 26 states in which women now have
presidential suffrage control 40 per cent
of the electoral college, over half of the
senate, 45 per cent of the house, and almost
half the votes in the party conventions.

THE WOMAN'S FARTY IN THE UNITED
STATES
(Translated from, the Italian- of an Article
in   &quot;J/Kpoca&quot;   Rome,  Italy  Feb.   16,   1919)
One of the most interesting of American
social movements 1$ certainly that of the
women, who have formed here a real party
of their own, active and powerful both
in those states in which they vote (about
one-half) and in those in which they do
not  v«»t  vote.
, It ie not possible to be long in America today without hearing the &quot;pickets&quot;
spoken of, at times with harsh severity,
and at others with the highest and most
sincere enthusiasm, even on the part of
men.
Anything which excites such dtversiy of
opinions and sentiments cannot fall to
arouse the interest of one who studies
a given country. &quot;The Pickets,&quot; the name
which familiarly distinguishes the members of the National Woman's party, are
not exceptions to this rule. This party
which constitutes the ■most active section of the suffrage movement in America, represents a particularly interesting
phase of the political activity of the women of the United  States.
The National Woman's party was formed a few years ago by the younger and
more 'militant spirts of the &quot;National
Woman's Suffrage Association of America.&quot; Under the active direction of Miss
Alice Paul, a small band of crusiaders be
came convinced that for effective propaganda and sucessful political action it was
necessary to use more direct and more
energetic methods. It was out of a schism
over this question of methods that there
developed the National Woman's Party,
with a quite definite plan of actiou, under the clever leadership—and, we may
say, somewhat autocratic leadership—of
Miss Alice Paul, who had learned political strategy and drawn inspiration from
her experiences in the pre-war campaigns  of the English  suffragists.
During the war, the continued propaganda and agitation of the National Worn-,
an's Party served only to increase the animosity of their enemies. The spirit
which animates this indefatigable band of
women, the spirit which is characteristic
of   the   methods   they   employ   la   one   of
grand   Impatience.     WhjM   da they   want?
; Ther   want   the   vote,   and   they   are   tired
; ot  empty promises tod   unredeemed   poiui-
l&quot;eal   pledges.    They  know  that   the  grant-
I trig  of   this   right   depends   upon   a   group
i of  politicians  and  they   beWeve  that  only
I the   pressure  of public  opinion   will  force
l.tht-m to cede It.
' As. the swiftest    and most     satisfactory
aieans.   of  guaranteeing    equgl     political
rights   to alt  American   women,  the  party
demands that congress shall approve without   dxiaj* the famoaa   Susan   B.   Anthony
amendment   to   the    constitution    of    the
United   States.     The  text   o.C   this   amendment,   guaranteeing-   equal   political   rights
to women',  was^tLrawn a half century  ago
by   the   famous   pioneer   of   the   feminist
movement in America whose name it bears.
i'&quot;S':nlarly for many  years the amendment
lias   I ecu   presented   to   congress,   and   as
regularly has been defeated.
U Is true that In many states the women
have finally wan the vote, but for the recognition of the rights of the women of j
the entire nation the National Woman's
Party demands swift and decisive action
by the ederal government. They maintain that the Federal government, which
enfranchised the negroes after the Civil
war, should exert this same authority ou
beiuiI? of the American women; aud hold
that the local and partial Cbncesaioms represent only a loss of time and a useless
waste of energy. For this reason they
concentrate their efforts upon the Federal
government, and more especially upon the
President himself, as the head of that government. They hold the President responsible for the passage of the amendment,
because—If he will he has sufficient power to urge and almost to compel its approval, and they believe that-if they concentrate all their attack upon him he will
end   by  taking up their cause.
Their   strategy well known  In  military
science Is that of concentrating the greatest possible force upon a single point of
attack; and to this end they have sought
•to draw the attention of the whole country upon the question of enfranchisement
'by constitutional amendment. They
wished to create in the public mind the
conviction that the President, was chiefly
responsible for this right, and that he
could grant or withhold it. They wished
to create a psychological condition. to
draw into a single focus of attention;
President, congress, amendment.
However, one may view the methods adopted by the party— and opinions
upon this point greatly vary—it cannot
be denied that they contain a valid political theory, and that they are, based upon
sound principles of propaganda and adver
tislng- a science which reached an extraordinary development in the United
States. At. all events, it cannot, he denied that these methods have obtained sue'

'■One April 17, 191.1, Miss Alice Paul.,.then
head of the Congressional committee of
the National American Woman Suffrage
association, demanded ah audience with
tho President. The President was too busy
to sec the delegation The delegation
marched to the white liOtfse to see the
Presldnt anyhow--and It, did. The editors were shocked. it was &quot;militancy.&quot;
Ten more times the militants sent delegations to see the President—and then he
came out for suffrage in New Jersey.
They fought him in 1916, picketed him
iu 1917—aud then ho c$mo out for the
Federal suffrage amendment. They stopped picketing for sis months. Then they
demanded, on Jum' 8, PU8, that he go to
the senate &quot;and tell the administration servants&quot; to vote for the Federal amendment.
Getting no results, picketing was renewed
on August 12, 19)8, aud continued until
tho President addressed the senate on
Sept. SO in favor of the force bill. Picketing stopped for three months. Then they
demanded a,-democratic caucus and started to burn the, President speeches. The
democratic caucus was fa#d—-but did not
adopt the suffrage resolution. Then the
suffragists burned the President in effigy. What will they do next? And, what
do  they want, next?

<dc:description>CITIZENSHIP   IN   NATIONAL   GOVERNMENT.
THE VOTE AND THE VOTER,
(By Mary Sumner Boyd)
What is Citizenship? For the time being, in order to have a working definition, we will say that citizens are of
two kinds; full or &quot;active&quot; citizens who
have both political and civil rights, and
partial or &quot;passive&quot; citizens—these will
give us some trouble later—who have
civil rights alone. Only as citizen of a
state can an American have full citizenship for only in this way can he have
voting rights. But only as a citizen of
the United States does he gain the fun-
damentals of civil rights.
With certain important limitations,
the federal constitution leaves to the
states the decision as to who shall be
full voting citizens and who shall not.
On their part, the states with the exception of eight, in conferring voting
citizenship lay down as one requirement
that a voter must have first of all that
degree of citizenship which the United
 States government alone can give. The eight exceptional states (Arkansas, Delaware,
 Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ne-
braska, South Dakota and Texas) give
voting rights to aliens who have taken out their first papers, &quot;declared their
intention&quot; to become citizens of the
United States. Among jurists there is
doubt as to whether these states have
not assumed a power to which they have
no right in allowing persons not yet
naturalized to vote for members of congress. A case has never come to federal
courts however, and the federal constitution, in the first of its four important
references to voting qualifications, specifically provides that electoral qualifications in respect to congress shall be
left to the states. Article I, Section 2,
of the Constitution of the United States
says: &quot;The house of representatives
shall be composed of members chosen
... by the people of the several states
and the electors in each state shall
have the qualifications for electors of
the most numerous branch of the state
legislature.&quot;
In only two respects, one minor and
one major, does the federal constitution control voting citizenship. Of presidential elections, Article II, Section &amp;,
says: &quot;Each state shall appoint in such
manner as the legislature thereof shall
decree, a number of electors.&quot; The
United States decrees that not the electors enumerated by state constitutions
but those decided on by the state legis-
latures shall elect the president of the
United States.
The  major limitation  on the  states'
power  to  determine  voting  citizenship
is  the XV Amendment  of the  United
States Constitution. &quot;The right of citi-
zens of the United States to vote shall
not be denied or abridged by the United
[States or] by any state  on account of
(missing) previous condition of ser- (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>State laws determine many civil
rights; they may, for instance, as in Vir-
ginia, prevent a woman—who, the opponents of suffrage are apt to tell us,
has equal civil citizenship with men—
from practicing law, or in Delaware,
from having an equal claim with her
husband to her children, or, as in Louisiana, from having equal control of the
community property with her husband.
Since there are forty-eight states with
forty-eight codes it is impracticable to
specify here what the state civil rights
of citizens consist  in.
The first eight amendments of the federal constitution are always thought of
as giving civil rights to American citizens. They did, in fact, give civil rights
to &quot;all residents or inhabitants of the
country, alien or citizen. These rights
are freedom of religion, of speech, of assemblage and of petition, right to bear
arms, to public trial, to trial by jury,
security from seizure of life, liberty or
property without due process or law,
from excessive bail fines and penalties
and from the burden of quartering soldiers in time of peace.
Justice Miller of the United States
supreme court in the Slaughter House
cases sums up the federal civil rights of
citizens and Inhabitants. The citizen of
the United States has &quot;the right to seek
 its protection, share its offices, tans-
act business and engage in administering its functions. He has the right to
free access to its seaports through
which all operations of foreign com-
merce are conducted, to the sub-treas-
uries(?) and land offices in the several
states.</dc:description>

<dc:description>EQUAL SUFFRAGE DEPARTMENT
Editors:-
Mrs. Julia Lucky, President of Equal Suffrage League, and
Mrs. Sara H. Hood, Secretary.
AN APOSTLE OP PROGRESS.
It requires the prophet's vision, and also
also. Jane Addams calls the &quot;social conscience,&quot; to be able to see beyond the
narrow confines of present conditions
and personal interest, and to grasp the
ultimate  welfare of the race at large,
what Jane Addams calls the &quot;social conscience, become the pioneers of progress,
the leaders of humanity in the upward
march of civilization. Every age and
nation has had such leaders, who, lured
by the &quot;Divine Discount,&quot; left beloved
associations and familiar traditions to
open up the toilsome way to new continents, new fields of endeavor, near
realm of thought, new social orders. To
no class of reformers is more honor due,
than to those courageous souls, men and
women, who in the early years of the
nineteenth century set in motion the
&quot;ungodly agitation&quot; derisisely called
&quot;The Woman's Rights Movement.&quot; They
went as into battle those brave pioneers
and fought a good fight, the results of
which, in the form of larger religious,
social, educational, industrial and politi-
cal liberty, are felt by women today
throughout the world.
It is gratifying to know that Knox-
ville can boast of at least of one far-
sighted, broad-minded statesman who as
long  as   thirty   years  ago,   perceived   the
justice of this then 
unpopular   cause
and stirred the still waters of southern-
conservatism with his able defense of
it, published while editor of the Knox-
ville. Daily Chronicle—the predecessor of
The Journal, which, in its turn, was
the predecessor of The Journal and
Tribune. Through the courtesy of Judge
Henry R. Gibson, the author of these
editorials, they are again submitted to
the public through the columns of this
&quot;The Equal Suffrage Department&quot; of
The Journal and Tribune.
Though written while the movement
was still in its infancy and practically
untried save as the radical venture of
a new crude state of the far away west,
no stronger, sound or more logical statement of the woman's cause has been
made today than is contained in these
old editorials, which, so far as known,
were the first to appear in a Knoxviile
paper.
Moreover, the prophecy that &quot;women's
political sphere would in the main be her
own horizon&quot;—has been literally fulfilled in every state and country in which
Equal Suffrage has been granted.
RESULTS OF  WOMAN-SUFFRAGE:
THE IMPROVEMENT OE HOME
AND NEIGHBORHOOD.
(Daily Chronicle, April 8, 1883.)
Our editorial on woman suffrage, inst
Sunday, having attracted such extraordinary attention, and we having been
repeatedly requested to give our views
of the results of woman suffrage, do not
feel entirely at liberty to discontinue the
discission.
The opponents of woman suffrage are
fond of drawing two pictures: one representing women lowering themselves by
engaging in all sorts of political immoralities; the other representing base men
as staining women's garments and character in the whirls of political corrup-
tion. 
These two pictures are painted, ordinarily, either by men who are a very
low order of demagogues, or by men
who so despise demagogy as practically
to confound it with true politics.
Both   pictures   are   wholly   imaginary,
and  will never have    any   reality.   We
have passed through several eras of this
 sort       already.   When  negroes  were  al- 
lowed   to  be witnesses,  it  was charged 
that they would swear multitudes of in-
nocent  white men  into  the penitentiary 
or onto the gallows.  When women were
allowed to be witnesses in cases  where- 
in  their  husbands     were     interested,   it
was charged that she would  swear any 
lie her husband would    invent.       When 
poor people were allowed to vote, it was 
charged   that   corruption   and   ignorance
would soon bury free institutions in the
 tomb of infamy.
But all these charges have proved to
be powder too feeble to flash, much less
project  the solid shot of truth.
Women are allowed to vote on all
questions in Wyoming territory, and yet,
strange to say, the territory prospers'
and is more free from lynching, robberies,
 murders, and other felonies than
any western  state or territory.
Women are allowed to vote in Eng-
land and several northern slates for
school directors, and strange to say, the
schools are found to prosper like flowers
in springtime.
Under Elizabeth, England prospered
and spread to a degree thitherto un-
known; and under  Victoria her empire
has fortified itself in every climate on every continent and in every ocean of the whole earth.
These  facts should, at least, make us
ponder. And are our mothers, our wives, 
our  sisters and our daughters so
intellectually low in our estimation
as to make a discussion of their rights a thing for jest and ridicule?
We do not believe that woman would, 
scourged out of existence, the weak upheld in their rights, the strong prevented
from getting more than their share, virtue revered, education fostered, industry
honored, and religion worshiped.
Has woman NO PLACE in this sort
of polities.
The truth is: a large part of the opposition to woman suffrage grows, 1st,
out of a fear on the part of the worst
men that woman's vote will interfere
with their sinful practices; and 2nd, out
of a disposition on the part of women to
say &quot;ditto&quot; to whatever men may favor.
The farther the man or the nation
from intelligence and morality the farther woman is from equal rights. The
higher the man or the nation in intelligence and morality the more nearly his
social and political equal do his mother,
wife   and   sister   become.
2nd. The second argument against
woman suffrage is that she is unfit to
bear arms in time of war.
This argumet't would disfranchise a
majority of the males in every nation.
Arms-bearing is no qualification for suf-
frage. Our boys over 18 years are required to bear arms, but not allowed
to  vote. A foreigner just landed can
bear arms, but is not allowed to vote. If
arms-bearing is a test of suffrage rights,
the one armed, the lame, the blind, the
deaf, the dumb, the feeble, and the cowardly, would all be disfranchised.
But are murder, robbery, arson, and
wholesale devastation such sacred pursuits of a noble manhood that women
are too ignoble to have any say in them?
Instead of woman's inability to engage
in murder, robbery, arson, and miscellaneous atrocities being an argument
against woman suffrage it is an argument in favor of it.
 All wars are crimes, the most mountainous of crimes. Nations have no more
more right io settle their differences with
cannon than individuals to settle theirs
with pistols. Wars convert men into
devils, wives into widows, children into
orphans, homes into ashes, love into
hatreds, earth into hell.
And forsooth! woman is to be disfranchised because she is NOT FIT
to engage in this most diabolical of all
diabolisms of the devil!
Woman's vote will be for peace, for
arbitration of national difficulties, for
keeping the sword sheathed and the
black flag of death forever furled.
The arms-bearing  argument means
that if women will become amazons get
hearts of fiends and like
&quot;The   Spanish   maid   aroused,
Hang on the willow her unstrung guitar.
Sing the loud song,  aud dare  the deed
of war.&quot;
then   she  will  approximate  near enough
to the greatness of man to be allowed
to vote!
If war is man's  mission and  destiny 
NO ONE would have the right to vote. 
Every   question    would   be   decided    by
brute force.
Voting implies that peace is man's mission and destiny, aud that intelligence,
morality, justice and right are his weapons.   Can't  woman  use  these  weapons.
3rd. The crowning argument with
many against woman-suffrage is the
third: that it would not purify politics,
but  would  debase   her.
This grows out of a misconception of
politics and is answered  under the first
head.     We  deny  both  branches of  this
third argument.   We believe that woman 
suffrage would, purify politics, and would 
not contaminate  woman.     Is the  Sister
of   Charity   contaminated   by   becoming
a ministering  angel  in  the hospitals  of
war?    Are the noble ladies of Knoxviile
contaminated   by   their   efforts   to   save
our   vagrant  girls from  lives  of  shame
and   crime?
If polities convert our voting places into sinks too foul for woman's angel
tread, that is no argument against woman-suffrage; but is an argument against
free government itself.
We, however, denounce this charge
as a lible on our men. Our voting
places are not dens of infamy. It is
true crowds gather there; but this is
the fault of the law, and one of the
first things our women would do, if
given a vote, would be to prohibit all
manner of crowding, or soliciting votes,
or other electioneering at or near our voting  places.
To say that men would so conduct
themselves at the ballot box as to make
a lady blush is an argument against
these men having the right to vote, but,
no argument against woman-suffrage.
This argument would also disfranchise
refined  Christian  gentlemen!
The truth is every shackle now on woman is a vestige of man's brutality;
and the day is near when woman will
be man's legal and political equal. And
then she will purify the political atmosphere as she now purifies the social atmosphere.
When she becomes entitled to a vote,
vice will sink to its deepest dens, political defamation will be stricken with an
everlasting dumbness, the seducer will
have a brand blacker than Cain's burned
into his cheek, the temperance cause will
triumph gloriously, Avars will soon become the pastime of pagans only, edit
cation will shine with a new and grander brilliancy, and religion will crown
our race with a tiara such as an(missing)
wear.
as a rule, take an especially active part
in   national  politics.  If  entrusted   with
the ballot.  Her political    sphere,      we,
think,  would,   in  the main  be  her  own horizon. Her aspirations would be to
protect and purify her home and her 
neighborhood. She would insist on such 
legislation as would protect her husband 
and her son from the temptations of the 
Demon of Drink, from the fascinations
of the Goddess of Gambling and the se-
ductions of the Siren's song.
And  herself  and  her     daughter    she would protect from the air-defiling profanity of the blasphemer, from the soul-
destroying contamination of the seducer, and from all things that offend the eye 
of propriety or the ear of delicacy. She would see to it that the young
vagrant was trained into good citizenship instead of being graduated on the
gallows. The charity of the law she
would make as broad, and as benignant
as that of religion. Churches would no
longer be defiled by the scoffs, of the infidel scorner. Schools would be made as
Sacred as the temples of wisdom should
be. And all manner of works that are
good, true and beautiful would be fostered with kind voices, gentle hands
and   loving   smiles.
And in our towns, how soon the
streets would be worthy of woman's
tread, how soon disorder, unseemly
crowds, profanity and indecency would
disappear, and how thoroughly sanitary
regulations would   be   enforced!
In brief, the politics of the woman
would be to promote the welfare of herself, her husband and her children as
human beings rather than as citizens of
a nation.
And when men become perfect as human beings we will risk them as citizens. And when women make their
homes and neighborhoods worthy of the
abode of Christian ladies and gentle-
men we will go the nation's security
that it will be worthy to float the flag
of peace and sing the song of a new
salvation.
JUDGE HENRY R. GIBSON.

Mrs. L. Crozier French Guest Of
Browning Circle.
Tuesday was the annual observation of Vice-president's
day of the Browning Circle. At
the close of the business meeting, Pres. Mrs. Moody presented Mrs. W. W. Grant to the Cir-
cle as the Vice-president. Mrs.
Grant made a fine talk and at
its close, introduced Mrs. L.
Crozier French, of  Knoxville,
who was present as the honored guest of the Circle. Mrs.
French made a very interesting and instructive talk on,
&quot;Law, its necessity, beauty and
beneficence.&quot; In speaking of the
laws of Tennessee as relating
to women, she spoke of the
fact that they had been wonder-
fully improved by the last legislature and would be made
still better by the next one.
Mrs. French is Pres. of the Suffrage League of Tennessee and
of course wants to see and says
she will see, the women of Tennessee given the ballot. She is
a very entertaining speaker and
a very pleasant appearing lady
and makes friends wherever
she goes. The ladies, fortunate
enough to be present at this 
meeting were loud in praises 
of the afternoon's entertainment.  The rooms of the libra- 
ry were artistically decorated
in yellow and white the club colors.
 A social hour was enjoyed during which tea and sand-
wiches were served by several
young ladies thus- closing a very pleasant afternoon.
TUESDAY NIGHT
Mrs. French spoke to the cit-
izens of Athens    in the library
Building Tuesday night at 7:30. I
Her subject was ''The Enfran-
chisement    of    Women.&quot;    Her 
talk was logical, instructive and 
 entertaining. She presented her
 ideas in a plain matter of fact 
way that appealed to her audi- 
ence.    After the meeting steps
were taken toward the organization of a Suffrage League in 
Athens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>KNOXVILLE WOMEN ARE ELATED
AT RATIFICATION OF SUFFRAGE
'RED LETTER DAY' FOR AMERICA
    **
Expressions of Gratification From Many Throughout City When
Informed by The Sentinel of Action of Legislature—Had Felt
Disappointed Last Night After Defeat In North Carolina Senate—
Praise Sons of Tennessee Who Have Given Women the Privilege of Casting Ballot. 
Hurrah!
Women have won their fight!
Hats off to Tennessee scions who
have made this the &quot;Perfect Thirty-
Sixth State&quot; and granted women of
America the right to vote and participate in the government of the country!
These expressions of rejoicing were
voiced by Knoxville women when informed by The Knoxville Sentinel
this afternoon that suffrage had been
ratified by the legislature, although
a reconsideration of the  action of
today is suggested as likely to be proposed.
Enthusiasm and exultation over the
victory was all the greater, because
many suffrage leaders had despaired
of a victory after announcement from
North Carolina last night that the
senate there had defeated the movement.
Announcement of the triumph came
generally as a surprise to Knoxville
women. Many who had not given up
hope had thought action on the question might be postponed and the
emancipation of women delayed.
All agreed that it means the dawn
of a new day for America and the
world. 
MRS. SARAH HENRY HOOD—
&quot;I'm perfectly delighted. I haven't
had anything to make me so happy
in years. The passage of this ratification measure means that Tennessee
again has the proud distinction, as
at King's Mountain, of turning the
tide of battle to a victorious conclusion of American independence.&quot;
MISS ADA FANZ—&quot;I'm just glad
that it has come about. That is all
that I can say, but I certainly am
glad that it has gone through at
last. I have been out of active suffrage work for several years, but I
rejoice over the victory just the
same.&quot;
MRS. R. E. L. MOUNTCASTLE—
&quot;Good! Grand! You don't mean it.
Tennessee is in line with its past record of being the original volunteer
state. She came into the union under difficulties. She saved the day
for American independence at King's
Mountain. She was the last state to
secede from the Union at the time of
the civil war. She was the first state
to be re-instated. The uniqueness
of the position of Tennessee in history
has become even more apparent after
this last victory in which it turned
the tide for the independence of Amer-
ican women. I personally am more
than grateful to the members of the
legislature who voted for the amendment, and I feel that the suffrage
workers both democratic and republican, should be most thankful for the
favors received from both parties.
The women have fought actively on
all occasion for suffrage, and have
been awake to their every responsibility.&quot;
MRS. H. G. MILNOR- &quot;Who?
What did you say? Who did? What?
Ratified? Well—!!! You don't mean
it? I'm so glad you told me. Was
there a margin of only three votes?
Well! I wonder if Mrs. L. C. French
knows it yet? Don't you reckon
Nashville is wild? I'd sure like to see
that Mr. Seth Walker. I think that
I'll send Mrs. George F. Milton, of
Chattanooga, a telegram of congratulations. New I wonder what the
legislators will give us trouble about
&quot;twill be something, but now that we
have the amendment, we don't care
what it is.&quot;
MRS. WALTER BARTON—&quot;I
think women's sphere is in the home,
and for that reason I have never approved of woman suffrage.&quot;
MRS. H. J. KELSO—&quot;Oh, that is
fine! I am just delighted. Last
night things looked so gloomy that
I had about given it up, but this
morning—!&quot;
MRS. C. E. Lucky—&quot;I was so hopeless last night. And it has really
gone through? The only thing that
half expresses it it 'praise the Lord!'
I feel that I am ready now to go to
my grave. I can't express my feelings about this very well. It has
been the work of a life time and it
has brought its reward at last. I am
proud of the men of Tennessee who
have seen their  duty at last.&quot;
MISS KATE WHITE, state chair-
man of the research work of the
suffrage movement—&quot;I am delighted.
This is one of the greatest things for
Tennessee. We women pay taxes,
but are allowed no representation, and
the vote of the women will make a
difference  in  every  election.&quot;
MRS. GEORGE F. MELLEN.—
&quot;This is the concluding part of a
democratic movement started in the
nineteenth century, for the liberation
of all people.    I am glad of this.&quot;
MISS MARGARET AMBROSE.—
&quot;No news could please me better. I
am delighted. We are pleased that
Tennessee showed her colors on this
matter, and we are not ashamed of
Tennessee.&quot;
MRS. L. C. FRENCH.—&quot;Isn't that
great? That's fine! We'll have to
give a big victory celebration the
first Wednesday in September when
the Non-Partisan league meets. I'm
rejoiced, of course, but the only thing
that I can't understand is why those
men in Nashville wanted to delay so
long.&quot;
MRS. DON P. TRENT—&quot;And they
have really ratified? Well isn't that
fine! That is splendid! It is a compliment to Tennessee that it should have
had the opportunity of casting the deciding vote. I am proud that the honor
of completing the ratification program
came to Tennessee. Every woman
should be very happy over the result
of the fight at Nashville.&quot;
MRS. N. E. LOGAN—&quot;Isn't it wonderful? I have just heard it and it
seems too good to be true. Every hope
seemed to be lost last night, and now
here comes the victory! I feel that
women can hold up their heads now and
act like- real people.&quot;
MISS LOUISE BIGNALL—&quot;What!
What again! So we got it? What was
the majority? Well, even if it wasn't a
big majority we got it. How we did
it and by what majority doesn't make
any difference.&quot;
MISS JENNIE IRWIN.—-&quot;Is that
so! Well that is just fine. I just
think that is great, I think everything
of it. Hurrah for the legislature. 1
can't think of anything good enough
to say.'
MRS. H. E. CHRISTENBERRY—&quot;I
shall send a telegram to Mrs. Annie
Cottrell Waver and Mrs. Ethel King,
who are in Nashville in the interests of
suffrage. The telegram reads: 'Congratulations. Express our regards to
the legislators.! &quot;
MRS. T. P. MILLER—&quot;Is it really
true? Has the house really passed the
ratification resolution? Really? Truly?
It seems difficult to believe, after the
claims of the antis yesterday and last
night, and after the rebuffs our suffrage workers have had. And yet how
glorious! What a wonderful victory!
How it will bring glory to dear old Ten-
nessee! I am incapable of expressing
my great gratitude to the splendid men
'in the legislature whose support and
votes have made possible this wonderful victory! It means the dawn of a
better day for America and for the
world, that women are to have the ballot and thereby, exercise, a control, and
an authority in the politics of the na-
tlon. How happy suffragists should be
today!&quot;
MRS. SOPHIE HUNTER—&quot;Oh, isn't
it awful. Just think that we women
will have to go to the polls and take
part in your old politics. I regret the
action of the legislature. Women
should stay at home instead of having
the vote. But I suppose it is all right,
as we are ein the march of what some
call &quot;progress.&quot; 
MRS. J. L. MORGAN—&quot;Well, I hope
those women who have sought the vote
will be happy. I have been content to
leave the voting to the men. However,
now that the women have the vote, I
hope the results will be for the great
good of the nation.&quot;
MRS. J. MARION MILLER—&quot;Has
suffrage really passed? All right. No,
I have nothing to say. We'll really go
to work now, won't we? We'll get busy
and see what we can do.&quot;,
MISS HASSIE GRESHAM—&quot;It is
simply a working out of justice. Sometimes it takes a long time for justice
to be obtained, but sooner or later it
will come. I am very highly delighted.&quot;
MRS. WALTER STARNES NASH—
&quot;I think the eyes of all America were
on Tennessee, and now that the legislature has actually ratified the amend-
ment the women from all over the country will feel grateful to those who put
ratification through.&quot;
MISS ELIZABETH TURNER—&quot;That
is certainly fine. I thought Tennessee
would not fail her women when the
chance came to give them the vote. I
am so glad.&quot;
MRS. EMMA RICE—&quot;Well, that is
fine. I think that is the greatest thing
Tennessee has done in many years,
greatest thing for the women of the
state and the women of the nation. I

 This union likewise secured the es-

FORTY YEARS OF WORK FOR
SUFFRAGE  BY   MRS. FRENCH

Gratification and relief &quot;beyond
all powers of expression&quot; over the
ratification of the woman's suffrage
amendment by the Tennessee legislature and its consequent nation-wide
adoption was voiced this afternoon
by Mrs. L. Crozier French, Knox-
ville's pioneer worker in the votes for
women's cause.
• The crowning of forty years of
aspiration, organization and work
gives me this profound feeling of
satisfaction, Mrs. French explained,
while the great relief springs from
the realization that the fears we have
been experiencing that the antis
would win and force us to fight the
battle all over again have proved
groundless.&quot;
This veteran battler for woman's
rights then gave her opinion as to
the effect of the granting of woman's
suffrage would have on national and
world affairs besides sketching in
graphic and interesting fashion the
history of the movement in Knoxville in particular and the state of
Tennessee in general.
&quot;Ratification by our legislature
gratifies me not only because this
is my home state but because it is
a southern state,&quot; declared Mrs.
French. &quot;The action of Arkansas,
Kentucky, Texas and Tennessee redeems the south. Votes for  women
will mean first and supremely the
protection of the home and make for
true democracy.
&quot;For just as man was endowed by
the Creator with the spirit that
drives him forth to overcome obstacles in the way of himself and family so &quot;He endowed the woman with
the nourishing, cherishing maternal
spirit that causes her to see that the
weaker one of the flock have an equal
chance with  the  stronger.   The  man naturally tries   to   advance   his   sons to succeed him while the woman tries
to bring out the girls along with the
boys.
Began  Life Forty Years Ago
From her girlhood days Mrs.
French had been an admirer of Susan
B. Anthony and the other original
suffrage leaders, and as far back as
forty years ago, when to be a suffragist was regarded in the south as
being a freak she began to plan toward introducing the cause in Knoxville.
For many years she stood almost
alone as far as Knoxville was concerned but throughout the state at
large the entering wedge for suffrage was driven by the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union.
Even after the organization of the
Tennessee State Suffrage association
it was the W. C. T. U. that produced
the deepest impression because on
account of its &quot;dry&quot; activities. It en-
joyed wide popularity in the south
while the avowed suffrage bodies
were far from popular.
Prominent among the very earliest
and most faithful workers for the
cause in this state was Mrs Lide
Meriwether, of Memphis, a W. C. T.
U. Leader, who with Mrs. Lyle Saxon,
of Memphis, organized the State Suffrage association of which Mrs.
French was one of the earliest mem-
bers.
Associated   with   them   were   Mrs.
J. D.  Allen and Mrs.  Betts,  the latter a daughter  of  Mrs.  Meriwether,
both of whom lived in Memphis.
Organized  Ossoli  Circle.
Meanwhile the women of Knoxville
remained either indifferent or hostile
toward suffrage, but as a means toward getting women to   act together
Mrs. French organized the Ossoli circle,   the   literary   organization   which
celebrated its  thirty-fourth  anniversary-
  last   November,   and   which   still
remains purely literary in its aims.
  Educational   And   Industrial   Union.
Five years later the first effort (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>How Will Women Vote?
THE movement that is now under way in Knoxville owes much to the women. Two capable
and public-spirited women helped frame the new charter—-Mrs. W. L. Morris and Mrs.
E. L. Thomas. There were many women on the general and district committees which nominated the 'People's Ticket.
Many women — and men, too for that mater—believe it would have been a good thing if
a woman had been put on the People's Ticket for council.
But we believe there are few women who agree with Mrs. L. C. French that the People's
Ticket should be discarded because it does not contain a woman candidate.
Most women are primarily interested in the welfare of the city and their homes. To them
the &quot;woman's movement&quot; is less important.  Most women's interests in politics is in claning (sic.)
 up government, and especially city government, so that their homes will benefit therefrom.
 So rapid is the advance of women in industry and in public affairs that most women are not
 indignant because it is not faster. To most women, the participation of women in the People's
movement marks distinct progress.    Office holding will come  soon enough to please    most women.</dc:description>

<dc:description>SUFFRAGE LEADERS
ANTICIPATED TROUBLE
Tennessee    Women    Express
Faith in Present Legislature.
Prominent women from different sections of the state express their faith in
the called session of the legislature to
make Tennessee the thirty-sixth state
to ratify the Susan B. Anthony amend-
ment to the federal Constitution.
Mrs. Leslie Warner, of Nashville;
Mrs. L. Crozier French, of Knoxville,
and Mrs. Isaac Reese of Memphis, all
pioneers in Tennessee suffrage and
earnest workers in the cause for broad-
ening the field of woman's activities,
anticipate no trouble in the passage of
the Nineteenth amendment by the Tennessee   legislature.
In communications to The News they
express themselves in the following
manner:
&quot;Nashville,   Tenn.
&quot;I anticipate no trouble having the,
amendment ratified by this legislature
at called session. This legislature generously gave all our benighted constitution allowed. I believe the men are
as anxious to give us the vote as we
to have it. We could never have won
with a different legislature.
(Signed) &quot;MRS. LESLIE WARNER.&quot;
&quot;Knoxville, Tenn,
&quot;Without   doubt,   the   Tennessee   leg- 
islature in special session will not forego   the   splendid   opportunity   to  be   the
thirty-sixth   state  to  ratify  the   federal
suffrage amendment.
&quot;Tennessee  is   not  so  strictly   a  one-
party   state   that   it   has   ceased   to be
progressive.     Our  republicans  keep  our
democrats  awake   to opportunities.
(Signed)    &quot;L.    CROZIER   FRENCH.&quot;
&quot;Memphis, Tenn.
&quot;It seems to me that the legislature
would gladly seize the occasion, if allowed by the governor, of making Tennessee the thirty-sixth state to ratify
the Susan B. Anthony federal amendment, not only because there is an
overwhelming sentiment for woman
suffrage in the state, but it offers the
democratic party a wonderful opportunity to poll a large woman's vote in
the doubtful states of the union, for
the women are anxiously waiting to see
which party will be most active in giving them their freedom.        </dc:description>

* MRS. L.C. FRENCH 
* GIVES   &quot;SUFFRAGIST&quot; 
* AS HER &quot;AVOCATION.&quot; 
* 
* Votes for women?   Certainly. 

Suffragists ? Certainly again, and also yes, indeed! 
 Knoxville can boast of at 
 least one woman who admits 
 that she is a suffragist and »J
 admits it in such a way that
there can be no doubt of her
pride in the fact. This woman  is Mrs. L. Crozier French, 
 who has taken such a promi- 
nent part in women's activ- 
ities in getting the ballot in 
this state and indeed in the 
 nation wide fight for suffrage. 
 Mrs. French even claims herself a suffragist, by pro- 
fession and her friends have 
 known for some time that she
was a suffragist at   least   by avocation as her work in this 
 cause has been    characterized by untiring enthusiasm    and 
sound faith in    the    ultimate  outcome. 
 When registering, which
Mrs. French made one of her 
 early morning duties on this 
very significant registration 
day for Tennessee's women 
 voters, she was asked her 
avocation. Some of the women
who had registered be- 
fore Mrs. French, and some  who have registered since 
have hesitated at that question. Not so with this pioneer 
leader in the women's rights movement.    She took an add- 
ed grip on her    pen,    smiled 
with a    determined    curve to 
her lips, and    wrote    &quot;SUFFRAGIST.&quot;

<dc:description>
The Awakening in  Tennessee

All signs point to the fact that the
Women of Tennessee have been aroused from their clumber(sic.). They have at
last reached a point of development
where they are beginning to think for
themselves. They are beginning to take
hold of things more vital than   self-
culture.
Social service is woman's natural
field of action and in ever larger and
larger numbers are they coming forward to enlist for the struggle for better conditions. The most thoughtful
and best informed are examining into
existing conditions and informing
themselves as to the laws upon our
statute books concerning women and
children. Alas, in this state, the code
contains most inadequate legislation
for the protection of women and children.
At   the   mothers'   congress   held   in
Nashville,   March   28   and   2 9,   recommendations were made and resolutions
passed endorsing no less than a dozen 
bills for passage by the legislature, all 
concerning   the   protection   of  women 
and children. A special committee was
appointed   to   see that   the   necessary
steps were taken to have these meas-
ures become laws. Some of the suggested bills are: to have women made
of school-boards, and juvenile judge.
It was recommended that indigent
mothers with young children be given
pensions, that a pregnant woman under sentence to the penitentiary be
paroled until after the birth of the
child.
Mothers learned that little girls who
have been assaulted undergo additional wrongs during the trials. They
ask, therefore, that the judge and the
interested attorneys decide what evidence is relevant and admissable before examining girls who have been
assaulted. They desire that a woman
should be permitted to accompany the
girls when they appear before the
grand jury. Many expressed themselves as advocating a law forbidding
the press from giving the names or
girls who had been assaulted or seduced.
Never will women and children
have adequate protection until women
are enfranchised. Few human beings
have angelic natures and will consequently look out first for number
one. To be disfranchised is to belong
to class number two, and to come in
for a share when number one has all
he desires.
eligible to be notaries public, members
At the meeting of the East Tennessee Teachers' association held in
Knoxville last month a resolution was
handed to the chairman of the resolution committee asking endorsement
for the making of women eligible to
boards of education. Although so
many of the members of the association are women the resolution was
smothered in the committee and not
even shown respect enough to be submitted to the association for endorsement   or   rejection.
The self respect of teachers, like
many other classes of women, is
awakening and some of the teachers
were quite indignant at such treatment of the request. Tennessee needs
all the help she can get in the war
against illiteracy and many of us cannot understand why the intellectual
women of this section should not be
placed upon our school boards and be
given every encouragement to work
for the education of the children. Verily  the   ways  of   man  are  difficult  to
understand

<dc:description>NOT DISCOURAGED
Mrs. L. Crozier French has received
the following letter:
Birmingham, Ala., Aug. 3.
My dear Mrs. French:
Please allow me to thank you for
sending the paper containing the decision of the Tennessee court regarding
suffrage.    I have enjoyed reading it.
I am in Birmingham only over Sunday, returning to Montgomery tomorrow, for although we had an unfavorable vote on ratification several days
ago in the senate, we are fighting to
secure a reversal, which we think we
shall get a little later. At any rate
we are not yet &quot;defeated.&quot;
Thanking you  for  remembering me
I am, cordially,
PATTIE  R. JACOBS,
President Alabama    Suffrage    Association.
In Alabama, where the resolution was
voted down, it can be reintroduced. As
you know, we lost by only three votes.
We are just beginning to get active support from the prohibitionists in Alabama who seem to feel that there is
still hope  of ratification.
North   Dakota,   Massachusetts,   Ohio,
and New Hampshire, in raising money 
and on ratification work.
After Arkansas, Nebraska and Mon- 
tana have ratified when they meet next
week, one looks for additional impetus
to be given the movement. If we can
only keep up the work we are doing,
we believe that ratification will soon
be accomplished.  It is reported by Miss
Younger, our legislative chairman, that
the polls of the legislatures show that
thirty-five states now have a majority
of votes pledged for ratification. When
the thirty-sixth state is secured we
shall look for quick action.
I hope that this letter is not too long.
There is much else that I desire to tell,
but will  not risk taxing your patience 
further, 
Faithfully yours,
DORA LEWIS,
National Finance Chairman</dc:description>

<dc:description>MRS.  L. CROZIER-FRENCH
MRS.  L. CROZIER  FRENCH
Those who recall the active interest
taken by Mrs. L. Crozier French in the
club world of Birmingham during her
residence in this city and who know the
fearless policy and the thorough investigation she makes of all matters to which
she calls public attention, will not be
surprised at her latest enterprise, the
starting of a monthly journal to be
known  as   &quot;The  People.&quot;
Mrs. French will be editor and manager
of her journal, the first number of which
will  be  issued  in  Knoxville   this  month.
Mrs. French intends that her journal
shall be an exponent of the people. It is
to be a publication that will fearlessly
defend the rights and privileges of the
people and will vigorously demand the
enforcement of the laws that have been
enacted for the good government of the
people. It will contain news of the
month, current events, articles political
and literary, items concerning art, science, religion, health, ethics and education.
No one will doubt that this journal will
be conducted on broad and educative
lines and that it will be a potent factor
in promoting good government.
Mrs. French's aims will be to arouse the
people of her city to certain conditions
that now exist and she asks co-operation in the effort to rescue municipal
and county affairs from the hands of the
partisan politicians, be they Republicans
or Democrats. She believes that for a
people to allow partisans to manage their
municipal and county affairs is to submit to be made victims of the spoils system. Mrs. French's journal, in other
words is to be devoted to &quot;the idealizing
of the real and the realizing of the ideal.&quot;
Among the pertinent questions asked by
Mrs. French, and which may strike a
responsive chord in many cities are the
following:
Why should the Sunday closing law be
enforced against stores in general but
not against barrooms?
Why was the office of police matron
abolished, after having been in successful operation for ten years? Abolished,
notwithstanding the earnest protest of
Knoxville's  best  citizens.
Why is it that we have not enough
money to make our public schools what
they should be?
Why is it that we have not even one
little plat of ground for a resting place
in  the  heat  of   summer?
Why is it that the ordinances in regard to the keeping of our streets free
of filth are not in any  degree enforced?
It is because the people have not organized.
It is because the people have not said
to the officials, &quot;You must do your duty!&quot;
It is because the people have not said
to the ring leaders, &quot;Thus far shalt thou
go  and no  farther.&quot;
It is because the people have had no
means of expressing their will.
This need of the people is a vital one.</dc:description>

<dc:description>NOT EQUAL SUFFRAGE
We very much fear that the cause
of woman suffrage in Tennessee is
going to be disrupted and set back
by the mistaken course of its friends
and sponsors. The highest plea and
argument for equal suffrage is that
it shall be equal. The bill overwhelmingly passed by the house Friday fractures the equality principle
in two respects. It will give the women the franchise only in a limited
way, and it relieves the sex of the
prerequisite condition of paying a
 poll tax as one of the qualifications
for voting. This was a gallant act
on the part of the legislators but we
gravely doubt its wisdom. The relieving of women from the necessity
of paying a poll tax for voting in
presidential elections may tend seriously to unbalance the Tennessee
electorate as now constituted. Quite
a considerable element of our male
population do not consider it worth
the payment of the $2 poll tax to exercise their manhood privilege of
casting their ballots. Many of these
poll tax delinquents, however, have
female relatives or connections
through whom they may deem fit
and and be enabled to influence and
virtually exercise the ballot without
payment of the tax. This would be
scarcely fair to those citizens who
do pay poll tax and yet whose ballots might be killed by the influence
of men who do not pay it.
In saying this, we wish expressly
to disclaim any intention to infer
that genuine, sincere suffragettes
would or could be unduly influenced
by the men. But there is possibly a
large element of the sex in the state
who have taken no interest in the
equal suffrage question, either for or
against it, and who are not
qualified by patriotism and intelligence to properly exercise the
ballot, who might be used in this
way to the detriment of the electorate.

<dc:description>Mrs. L. Crozier French's
Views On Equal Suffrage
LOCAL SUFFRAGIST IS INTERVIEWED IN BIRMINGHAM
AND EXPRESSES HERSELF FREELY ON THE NATIONAL AND STATE PHASES OF THE ISSUE.
In the Birmingham Age Herald of
Tuesday, August 18th, there appears an
interview by Dolly Dalrymple, the well
known newspaper writer, with Mrs. L.
Crozier-French who has just returned
from a visit with her son, Mr. William
 French, of Birmingham. The interview
is accompanied by a splendid likeness of
Mrs. French and is in part as follows :—
BY DLLY (sic.) DALRYMPLE.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, the distinguished president of the Tennessee Equal
Suffrage associations who has been
among the prominent visitors to Birmingham during the past few days, needs
no introduction to the people of this
community.
Mrs. French is widely known as one
of the most intellectual, one of the most
forceful, one of the brainiest and one
of the most charming women whom the
south delights to honor.
As president of the Equal Suffrage as-
sociation of the grand old state of Ten-
nessee, Mrs.  French has become known
not only nationally, but internationally,
and her work in behalf of the cause has
given   her   precedence   and     prominence
wherever   intelligent   men    and   women
are assembled.    Mrs. French is the type
of   woman   who   is   distinctly   feminine
and insistently human.
With all her splendid intelligence and
learning, she has the warmest note of
sympathy hidden away in her heart—the
kindliest consideration for her fellow-
man—a spirituality that is surpassing
sweet, and a strength which is dominant meeting as she has in the pioneer
cause that she sponsors tremendous  op-
position, but always able to cope with
it—always able to win.
One of her greatest admirers, a young
woman of delightful personality and engaging charm, has said of Mrs. French
that &quot;she is made of the finest feminine
fabrics,&quot; and that if she were asked to
to sum up her one biggest quality in
the variations of her make-up, in a single short sentence, she would say:—
&quot;She is the most heroic type of moral
courage I have even seen.&quot;
 
Mrs. French chatted interestingly
with me a few days ago about suffrage
and its progress in the south.
She talked of Mr. Bryan's declaration
for suffrage as a distinct forward movement for the cause.
She talked of the &quot;Congressional union
and its position in suffrage ranks, that
the one note of militancy that had ever
been struck in the United States (which
by the way, she declares could never
exist as it does in England, because the
conditions could never by any possible
means be the same) had been sounded
by   this  organization.
She remarked upon Mr. Wilson's attitude toward suffrage as not surprising
to her in its conservatism, since in his
official position as President of these
United States he has not before been
called upon to inaugurate any measure
so radical, any measure so large, any
measure that meant so much to so many
people.
She spoke of the self-sacrifice that the
women who are espousing the cause of
suffrage are making in order to enable
them to raise funds for the work, and
the tribute of selecting the birthday of
Lucy Stone as &quot;Self Sacrifice Day&quot;—
the day upon which they amalgamated
in this purpose,  as timely and apropos.
She talked of many interesting phases
of suffrage, and she was particularly
happy in her delineation of the tense
situation in her own home state.
&quot;As to the opposition,&quot; I suggested,
'at the present time in Tennessee, to
what is it mainly attributable?&quot; I
asked.
&quot;The  opposition  to   the    enfranchise-
ment of women in Tennessee is mainly
apologetic at this moment. It is not 
an apathetic nature, or negative char-
acter. The trite threadbare phrase,
'Woman's place is in the home-' (which,
by the way, no one has ever disputed)
is uttered parrot-like by those who
seem unable to put forth any logical
argument against equal rights. Some
give it as their opinion that the women
who wish to vote ought not to be denied the right. Still others announce
that while they are not willing to work
for the cause they will certainly take
advantage of the privilege of voting
when 'votes for women' is an accomplished   fact,&quot;   Mrs.    French    answered.
'No organized effort. I understand,
has been put forth by the men of Tennessee for suffrage,&quot; I  observed.
&quot;Many of Tennessee's leading men
have indorsed woman suffrage, although,
as you have suggested, no organized
effort has been instituted,&quot; Mrs. French
replied. &quot;The men of our commonwealth
are not so deadly conservative, however, as are those of some other of our
southern states. A leading politician of
Tennessee in reply to the question,
&quot;When are you going to announce yourself for equal suffrage ?' answered that
he would do so whenever any considerable number of the people of the
state manifested their approval of
'votes for women.' He then added
'Do not try to get an amendment to
the constitution of the United States
passed, hut work only through the
state government.' As this view is held
by many, it seems well to give some
consideration to it now that Tennessee
is on the eve of organizing the forces
for a concerted movement for equal
suffrage.&quot;
&quot;For party aggrandizement.'' Mrs.
French continued, &quot;the blunder was
made a half century ago of enfranchising by means of a national amendment
a race born and bred in slavery, the
large majority of whom inhabited the
territory occupied by their former owners.
 The people of
this country forced upon the south dis-
advantageous conditions which they
would not themselves share. This conduct is now pronounced by the judicious as most reprehensible. Those who
suffered this great wrong are in many
instances naturally prejudiced against
enfranchisement by amendment of the
constitution of the United States. But
how different is the proposition of enfranchising the female of a race to
that of enfranchising an alien race! The
females of a race are in no sense inferior to the males of the same race,
and the recognition of their equality is
in the interest of justice and therefore
cannot work ill to the community. Class
distinction and privilege by governments- can only work evil to the whole
community—never good. The privileged
class will assume more and more authority, and become more and more
tyrannical, while those who are deprived
of equal opportunities are forced into a
subserviency, detrimental to strength of
character and material interest.&quot;
&quot;Do you find any indifference in the
attitude of the women of Tennessee as
a  whole toward  suffrage?&quot;  I  asked.
&quot;The indifference today of many
women of Tennessee to their right in
an equal share of governmental control;' said Mrs. Fronds, 'is due to the
habit of submission. Such women seem
to be able to sympathize with men in
their love of freedom, but are as children when the great questions of liberty and equality are argued in connection with the female sex. Thus is
shown one of the greatest injuries that
disfranchisement has inflicted upon women. Lack of self-esteem, a tendency to
be mean in spirit, is a most detrimental influence to character building. The
women of a race lay the foundations of
character in the youth and never will
man be of the highest type until mothers learn the real meaning of freedom
and enjoy it to the fullest extent in all
of its phases.&quot;

<dc:description>ANALYSIS OF AENSOR-
SHIP [CENSORSHIP] BILL
•SECTION 1 and 4 provide  a   total
of 9 new offices   in   Nashville   with
salaries totalling   $19,800.00    not   in
including   travelling   expenses     nor
maintenance,
SECTION 2 requites that every
picture to be exhibited in the state,
whether in a theatre, a charitable
institution or a private home must
be passed upon by the Censorship
Board.
SECTION 3 requires that a Review
Charge be paid either by the lessor or
lessee of $50.00 for every   picture   re-
viewed, whether it be   a   feature,   a
news reel, or a scenic.
SECTION 4 provides a total of five
stenographers and one Chief Clerk,
who, according to Section 1, shall
also be deputies with such authority,
and will inevitably have to pass upon
pictures, since three people cannot
review 16,000 feet a week, which
would require seven and one third
(7-1 3) hour six days a week of constant reviewing. These deputies,
who will be the censors in fact, are
to be paid only $1500.00 per annum. SECTION 5 provides a further tax
of 5 per cent of the gross receipts of
every theatre, which will increase
the taxes paid by motion picture
theatres in Tennessee to 21 2 percent
of their gross income, averaged per
theatre.
SECTION 7 Provides that every
picture exhibited any admission
charge, must be censored and that a
censor fee of $10 00 per picture shall
be paid This would prevent the exhibition of pictures for charitable
purposes, in churches, orphan asylums, hospitals and all custodial in-
stitutes.
In revenue fees alone this Bill
would cost the industry more than
$141,000.00 a year, figured on the 2,822
subjects released in 1922. Of these
subjects 615 were features; 658 two
reel comedies; 432 news reels; 50
scenic; 24 sport reviews; 580 one-reel
comedies, 5 three-reel comedies; 3
four-reel comedies; 69 half reels
&quot;fun from press&quot;, etc. 75 cartoons; 14
bible subjects; 86 two reel pictures;
151 two reel episodes; 33 miscellaneous
one reels; 30 three reel   playlets.
If this Bill were to pass, all short
comedies, news reels, scenics, bibli-
cal pictures and educational subjects
would have to kept out of the State
of Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Justice, Motive
in Mrs.  French's Pleas for &quot;Fatty.&quot;
 Clubwoman States Position
On Actor's Case Fully.
Nation Not Be Hurt.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, member of
the Better Films Committee, who did
(missing)ot concerned in the action of that
committee at its meeting on Friday
when it went on record as opposing
the return of Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle to the screen, states that her
position, in the matter more fully
yesterday.
In the report of the action of the
Better Films committee Friday on
the Arbuckle case, which was given
no doubt, by a member of that committee, my position was incorrectly
reported. I made no plea for Ar-
buckle personally, and so stated
most emphatically. Much might be
said in a plea for mercy and Christ-
ian charity for this man, but I
made no such plea. I took a higher
position than that. I urged that the
committee deal justly in the   case.
&quot;To me the morals of this nation
will not be affected in the least either by the return or non-return of the
Arbuckle films to the screen. My
plea is for justice, and I can recognize no justice in the resolution passed by the Knoxville Better Films
Committee Friday.
'Briefly, the case is this: Arbuckle
was tried by a jury of his peers
for murder and found not guilty.
I have seen probably every picture
featuring Arbuckle that has been
brought to Knoxville, and found
them free from the low vulgarity
that in the past marred so many
of the farce-comedies. To me the
only point left for the Better Films
Committee to pass judgment on is
the private moral conduct of this
film actor. This I positively refuse
to be drawn into. 'Early in my adult life I resolved
that I would never pass judgement 
upon the secret acts of any man or
woman, because of gossip of individuals or the press. The older I
grow, the more am I convinced that
this resolution was a good one. If,
as a member of the Better Film
Committee, it is considered one of
my duties to pass upon the moral
conduct of film actors and actresses.
I will immediately send my resignation to the chairman.&quot;
At the meeting referred to above,
a motion was passed to the effect
that the Better Films Committee of
Knoxville go on record as opposing
the return of Arbuckle to the screen,
and that Will H. Hays, director of
the motion picture industry be ad-
vised of the action taken.</dc:description>

<dc:description>BETTER FILMS
SPEAKER COMING
To Address Mass Meeting At
Bijou Feb. 5.
Movement     Sponsored     In
Knoxville By Members Of
Ossoli Circle.

A mass meeting will be held in the
interest of Better Films at the Bijou
theatre   Sunday  afternoon   February
5th,  at 3 o'clock  under  the auspices
of Ossoli circle.
Mrs. Phillip Spud [Speed], of the University of Virginia, a speaker of national
reputation, will be the chief speaker
at this meeting. She is to be sent
here by the national committee for
Better Films, and is considered an
able, speaker, courteous and cultured.
a club woman with much experience
in motion picture betterment, both
as a mother and a worker. She
heartily agrees with the position taken by the General Federation of
Women's clubs concerning the best
way of promoting improvement of
the movies.
Selection—not censorship is the solution, they claim. The National
Board discussed this subject thor-
oughly with motion picture theatre
owners of America, and has their assurance that they desire to co-operate whole-heartedly with community
groups which will support finer pictures, family programs and entertainments for young people. 
The desire for selected pictures,
for cooperation with community exhibitors, and for larger assumption
of responsibility by parents has
grown rapidly in all parts of the
United States. The National Board
of Review has led in this movement
for a wise and permanent solution
for the entire country.
The management of the Bijou
theatre has offered the use of the
theatre free of charge for this meeting, and Mr. Frank Nelson has consented to take charge of the musical
feature  of the program.</dc:description>

<dc:description>SELECTED MOTION PICTURES
WILL BE TOPIC OF MRS. SPEED

Officials of Ossoli Circle Announce Appearance of Virginia Uni-
versity Educator Here Next Sunday Afternoon — Censor-
ship Idea Not Involved But Selection. 
&quot;Selected Motion Pictures&quot; will be
the subject of an address to be given
by Mrs. Philip Speed of the University of Virginia when she appears on
Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock at the
Bijou Theater. Mrs. Speed is brought
to Knoxville under the auspices of
Ossoli Circle which is vitally interested in securing the highest type of
amusements for the people of the city.
Mr. Dunbar has given the use of the
theater and Frank Nelson will render
a special musical program.
&quot;The purpose of the meeting is to
arouse public sentiment for a better
type of motion pictures for Knox-
ville,&quot; Ossoli Officers said. &quot;The
people generally get what they want,
and pictures of a baser sort are only
screened because there are certain
people who enjoy looking at them.
The popularity of well known actors
attests to the wholesomeness of the
general taste, inasmuch as these best
sellers only appear in clean and entirely inoffensive pictures.&quot;
Selection Big Idea
Not censorship but selection is the
idea to be put forth in the mass meeting Sunday. Leading club women
and men of the city, as well as the
motion picture exhibitors will be invited to join in a frank and open
discussion of how to secure the best
always for Knoxville. The ministers
from  the  different  churches  will  be
urged to co-operate in the movement,
to announce the meeting in their pulpits Sunday morning, and to set an
example to their church members by
attending the gathering themselves.
Mrs. Speed, who will be the chief
speaker, is well known throughout
 the country as a leader in recreational work. She comes from a famous
old family, her grandfather having
been an ambassador to England for
the Southern Confederacy. Mrs.
Speed was educated in Virginia and
Washington, and became the vice-
principal of Gunston Hall in that
city. Both as a teacher and mother,
she has been concerned with the
&quot;leisure time problem&quot; of young people and has given freely of her energy
to the student life of the university.&quot;
Pioneer Worker
In 1915-16, she did pioneer work, in
New York City, in building up Saturday morning entertainment for the
young people. This brought her into
close association with the Board of
Education, city officials and of parents. Later, because of her ability,
she was called upon to assist in selecting
 pictures for the Training
Camps for the Army and Navy, and
for the men on the battlefields of
Europe.
Mrs. Speed has a practical message
of decided import for the club women,
teachers, ministers and parents of the
city, and will be heard with the deepest interest by those who are concerned in solving the motion picture
problem to the best advantage of (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>A CORRECTION

In the Herald of Jan. 10th appears an article headed &quot;A
 Wrong Idea of Justice.&quot; In this
article my sister, Miss Lucy
Graham Crozier is taken to task
for having voted '&quot;no&quot; on a motion disapproving the return of
Arbuckle films to the motion
picture theatres.  There is no
doubt the article does Miss Crozier injustice as she does not belong to the Better Films committee and has had no opportunity of expressing by vote her
opinion on the momentous question as to whether Fatty shall
return or not.
About a month ago the fol-
lowing paragraph appeared in
the Herald:
&quot;A movement was started
yesterday in Knoxville to have
 Governor Taylor appoint Mrs.
 L. Crozier French to succeed
J Senator Shields. Mrs. French
has contributed several articles
to the Herald on political and
educational matters which
makes this appointment of local
interest.&quot;
Mrs. Lizzie Crozier-French
has never contributed an article
to the Herald, but Miss Lucy
Graham Crozier has done so. It
is evident that the writer of the
quoted paragraph and the article on &quot;Justice&quot; has confused
two sisters and placed to the
discredit of Miss Crozier the
&quot;wrong idea of justice&quot; of Mrs French. So easy is it to do an
act of injustice because human
nature is prone to error; said
Portia to the Jew, &quot;consider
this—that in the course of justice, none of us should see salvation.&quot;
Another act of injustice in
this connection; Mrs. French
did not vote to have Arbuckle
films return to the screen nor
did she make any plea for justice or mercy to be shown to the
man and she stated this most
clearly at the meeting. She was
simply opposed to the Knoxville
Films Committee taking any
action.
If one of the duties of the
Better Films Committee is to
act on the moral conduct of actors and actresses, I shall certainly resign my membership.
Mrs. Lizzie Crozier-French
Knoxville, Tenn.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mrs. L.   C.   French   &quot;Roasts&quot;
Women Who Give Time to
Pink Teas.
&quot;Who is to blame for the 26 square
miles of city territory Which is a white
elephant on the hands of the tax-payers
and the commissioners? Not the commissioners themselves, tout we, the peo-
ple who take no interest in municipal
 affairs..&quot;
This statement was made by Mrs.
L. C. French at the meeting of the
Good Citizenship class on Thursday afternoon at the Lawson McGhee library.
This class is making a study of &quot;Municipal Government.&quot;
&quot;Women are the leisure class. They
have time to make a proper study of
the needs of the city. If the women
who rush around to pink teas would devote half of the time they waste doing
that, in making a study of what things
are needed in the municipal government, things would be far better off,&quot;
declared Mrs. French.
&quot;We need a change in the charter,
the mayor ought to be the financial
agent of the city, and a woman should
be a member of the commission, to look
after the cleaning of the streets, the
general sanitary conditions and the
public buildings,&quot; the speaker stated
also.
At the last meeting of the class held
on December 17, Dean Malcolm McDermott
said that it was up to the newly
enfranchised women to change the order of things since men had made such
a failure of governing.
Women's place in  the new political
order is in the cities where they live.
Advice and helpful criticism is needed
to improve conditions, not severe roast-
ings from a biased point of view. This
is advocated as a step toward reform,
according to Mrs.   French.
Mrs. French said further that she
was opposed to the recall movement because it is the fault of the citizens who
refuse to do their part in the conscientious choosing of the officials.
It is hoped that a large number of
women of Knoxville will attend these
meetings every Thursday afternoon at
3 o'clock at the library for matters
of vital importance to the women of
the city and state are discussed with a
view to remedying some of the defects
of the  present   system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A WRONG IDEA OF JUSTICE
We have found many of Mrs.
L.    Graham   Crozier's   articles
well worth printing,   and   have
always given her space in the
Herald to   express   her   views.
But we are not at all in accord
with her in her views regarding
Fatty Arbuckle. We are considerably disappionted in the action
she has taken as a member of
the &quot;Better Films&quot;   committee
of Knoxville. Recently the committee passed resolutions calling
on the local theatres to refuse
thefe Arbuckle films entrance to
their theatres.    With   the   exception of Mrs. Orozier, the club
was   unanimous   in asking   it.
Mrs. Crozier comes out in defense of Arbuckle, saying that
&quot;in the name   of   justice&quot;   he
should be   permitted   the same
rights   as before his trial   for
murder, inasmuch as the courts
declared him innocent   of   the
murder of a movie actress.    We
want to ask if Mrs. Crozier or
anybody else really believes Arbuckle is blameless of the death
of Virginia Rappe ?   Mrs. Crozier   should   certainly   be   old
enough to know that   it   is almost an impossibility to punish
» man who had   the   financial
backing that was lined up in defense of Arbuckle, and his escape was freely predicted long
before the trial   began.   While
the courts   turned   him   loose,
there is no reason why decent
people should   come   to his defense and help further to whitewash him.    His films are being
outlawed in most cities, and we
have no doubt Knoxville people
will   do   likewise.   Fatty   can
never come back as a comedian.
Every time he tries to get funny
or do anything to make folks
laugh, the ghost   of   Virginia
Rappe will rise up to plague him.
A higher court than the California tribunal has already passed
judgment on him, and it would
be impossible for him to produce
funny films again.     The   only
hope for Fatty's existence is to
return to the Los Angeles saloon
and work at his old job of cleaning spittoons.</dc:description>

MRS. FRENCH, PRESIDENT OF THE TENNESSEE EQUAL SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION
TALKS OF CONDITIONS IN THAT STATE

By DOLLY DALRYMPLE
Mrs. L. Crozier French, the distinguished
president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage
 association, who has been among the prominent
 visitors to Birmingham during
the past few days, needs no introduction to the people of this community,
Mrs. French is widely known as one of
the most intellectual, one of the most
forceful, one of the brainiest and one of
the most, charming women whom the
south delights to honor.
As President of the Equal Suffrage association of the grand old state of Tennessee, Mrs. French has become known
not only nationally, but Internationally,
and her work in behalf of the cause has
given   her    precedence    and     prominence wherever intelligent men and women are assembled.  Mrs. French is the type of
woman who is distinctly feminine and insistently human. 
&quot;With all of her splendid intelligence and
learning, she has the warmest note of
sympathy hidden away in her heart --the 
kindliest consideration for her fellow man 
—a spirituality that is surpassing sweet
and a strength which is dominant, meeting as she has in the pioneer cause that
she sponsors tremendous opposition, but
always able to cope with it—always able
to win.
One of her greatest admirers, a young
woman of delightful personality and engaging charm, has said of Mrs. French
that &quot;she is made, of the finest feminine
fabrics,&quot; and that if she were asked to
sum up her one biggest quality in the
variations of her make-up, in a single
short sentence, she would say:
&quot;She is the most heroic type of moral
courage I have ever seen!&quot;
Mrs. French chatted interestingly with
me a few days ago about suffrage and its
progress in the south.
She talked of Mr. Bryan's declaration
for suffrage as a distinct forward movement for the cause.
She talked of the Congressional Union
and its position in suffrage ranks, that
the one note of militancy that had ever
 been struck in the United States (which,
by the way, she declares, could never exist as it does in England, because the
conditions could never by any possible
means be the same) bad been sounded by
this organization.
She remarked upon Mr. Wilson's atti-
ture toward suffrage as not surprising to
her in its conservatism, since in his official position as President of these United
States he has not before been called upon
to inaugurate any measure so radical, any measure so large, any measure that
meant so much to so many people.
She spoke of the self sacrifice that the
women who are espousing the cause of
suffrage are making in order to enable
them to raise funds for the work, and
the tribute of selecting the birth day of
Lucy Stone as &quot;Self Sacrifice Day&quot;—the
day upon which they amalgamated in this
purpose, as timely and apropos.
She talked of many interesting phases
of suffrage, and she was particularly
happy in her delineation of the tense situation in her own home state.

&quot;As to the opposition,&quot; I suggested  &quot;at
the present time in Tennessee, to what
is it mainly attributable?&quot; I asked.
&quot;The Opposition to the enfranchisement
of women in Tennessee is mainly apologetic at this moment, it is not of an apathetic nature, or negative character. The trite threadbare phrase, 'Woman's place
is in the  home'   (which,  by the  way, no
 one has ever disputed) is uttered parrotlike by those who seem unable to put
forth any logical argument against, equal
 rights. Some give it as their opinion
that the women who wish to vote ought
not to be denied the right.  Still others
announce that while they are not willing
to work for the cause they will certainly
take advantage of the privilege of voting
when 'votes for women' is an accomplished fact,&quot; Mrs.  French answered.
&quot;No organized effort, I understand, has
been put forth by the men of Tennessee
for suffrage,&quot; I observed.
&quot;Many of Tennessee's leading men have
indorsed woman suffrage, although, as
you have suggested, no organized effort
has been instituted,&quot; Mrs. French replied. &quot;The men of our commonwealth
are not so deadly conservative, however,
as are those of some other of our south-
ern states. A leading politician of Ten-
nessee in reply to the question, 'When are
you going to announce yourself for equal
suffrage?&quot; answered that he would do so
whenever any considerable number of the
people of the state manifested their approval of 'votes for women.' He then
added: 'Do not try to get an amendment
to the constitution of the United States
passed, but work only through the state
 government.' As this view is held by
many, it seeing well to give some consid-
eration to it now that Tennessee is on the (missing)
of organizing the forces for a con-(missing)
movement for equal suffrage.&quot;
'For party aggrandizement,&quot; Mrs.
French continued, &quot;the blunder was
made a half century ago of enfranchising by means of a national amendment a race born and bred in slavery,
the large majority of whom inhabited
the territory occupied by their former
owners. The people of large sections of
this country forced upon the south disadvantageous conditions  which they
would not themselves share. This conduct is now pronounced by the judicious as most reprehensible. Those who
suffered this great wrong are in many
instances naturally prejudiced against
enfranchisement by amendment of the
constitution of the United States. But
how different is the proposition of enfranchising the female of a race to
that of enfranchising an alien race! The
females of a race are in no sense inferior to the males of the same race,
and the recognition of their equality
is in the interest of justice and therefore cannot work ill to the community.
Class distinction and privilege by governments can only work evil to the
whole community—never good. The
privileged class will assume more and
more authority, and become more and
more tyrannical, while those who are
deprived of equal opportunities are
forced into a subserviency, detrimental
to strength of character and material
interest.&quot; 
&quot;Do you find any indifference in the
attitude of the women of Tennessee as
a whole  toward suffrage?&quot;  I asked.
&quot;The   indifference    today    of    many
women   of   Tennessee  to   their   right   to
an   equal   share   of   governmental   control,&quot;   said  Mrs.   French,   &quot;is  due to   the
 habit  of submission.  Such women  seem
to  be able  to  sympathize  with  men  in
their love of freedom, but are as chil-
dren when the great questions of liber-
ity and equality are argued in connection with the female sex. Thus is shown
one   of   the   greatest   injuries   that  disfranchisement has inflicted upon  woman.  Lack  of self-esteem,  a  tendency  to
be   mean   in    spirit,    is   a   most   detrimental    influence    to    character   building. The  women of a race lay the foun-
dations  of  character  in   the  youth  and
never  will man be  of the highest  type
until   mothers   learn   the   real   meaning
of freedom  and enjoy it to the fullest
extent in all of its phases.&quot;
   &quot;The argument used by some southerners against 'votes for women' in the
south  is   that   it   would   increase   the
negro vote,&quot; I suggested. &quot;What is your
opinion along those lines?&quot;
&quot;This objection is founded on prejudice and not on knowledge or wisdom,&quot; was the reply. &quot;The same restrictions which have been found effectual in controlling the negro man's
vote in many southern states, would
lose none of their force when applied
to negro women. Those who know conditions and have the wisdom to make
the proper application, have no misgivings, because the enfranchisement
of the women would give the south
more than 600,000 majority of white
women voters over both negro men and
women. The white race in the south
would therefore gain an added supremacy. Surely we have many men in the
south who are great enough statesmen
to recognize and take advantage of this 
situation.&quot;
&quot;Conditions are such now that Ten-
nesseeans have the opportunity of taking the lead of the southern states in
doing justice to women,&quot; Mrs. French
said proudly. &quot;As you know the National Woman's Suffrage association is
to meet in Nashville in November. That
is two moths before the meeting of our
next legislature. If every man and
woman in Tennessee who favors equal
suffrage would make some pronounced
demonstration of this fact during the
next few months our 1915 legislature
would be forced to favor the proposition. Early in October the Tennessee
Equal Suffrage association will meet in
convention at Knoxville. Every town
in the state of any consequence should
send one or more representatives to this
great gathering, to advocate putting
the women of Tennessee on an equal
footing with those of the states on and
near the Pacific coast. The women of
the south are surely not inferior to
those and do not deserve to be left in
the condition of the old feudal times
because of the apathy, indifference or
ultra-conservatism of the men of the
old Volunteer State.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMAN SUFFRAGE IS WARMLY DEFENDED Mrs. L.C.   French   Thinks Women Should Possess Right of Ballot. Editor The Sentinel: A comment upon a Sentinel editorial of  March  6. One of the most interesting points, psychologically considered, in the relation of the sexes, is the contrast between man's mental attitude to woman and her condition as expressed on different times and under different conditions in language polite either written or spoken, in editorials, essays and poems or in toasts at banquets, addresses before general audiences composed largely of women, at church
meetings where the motive is to get
women to work for large sums of
money to build a church, educate ministers or send to foreign lands to make
converts to the faith- on all these occasions woman is extolled to the skies,
there is no virtue that she does not
possess there is no quality of her's of
superlative degree, especially do men
on such occasions dilate upon the
beauty of self-sacrifice which they say
woman possesses in an eminent degree.
These speakers don't hesitate to say
that compared to woman, man is a
poor creature indeed; in fact, they insinuate he shines by reflected light
alone shed on him by mother, wife, sister or sweetheart.
But when we turn our attention to
the common law and to the statute
laws of most of our states, we are
forced to the conclusion that man's
mental attitude as expressed by these
records shows a most decided contrast.
By these, women is made a perpetual
minor. Her sons at the age of twenty-
one and the negro born into slavery
and yet only partly civilized are her
political masters. A prominent lawyer
of our city puts woman's legal condition in this state tersely thus: &quot;The
laws of Tennessee, in effect, declare
husband and wife are one and that one
is   the   husband.&quot;_
Mr. Editor, an excellent way to understand the feelings of another in a
given situation is to try and put yourself in imagination in his place—suppose some one should propose to disfranchise editors, saying that they
hold positions which give them great
influence, that through the press they
really control the sentiments and opinions of the world and that to let them
have the franchise is to give them more
power than any other class of people.
The howl that would be heard emanating from the editorial sanctums five
minutes after such proposition was
flashed upon the wires would fill the
earth with clamor. And you, Mr. Editor,
who seem to appreciate so slightly
your privileges of an American citizen,
would be no laggard in the fight to
not only hold your present privileges,
but to add to them when and how you
could. Just by the side of your editorials are cuttings from papers in Tennessee expressing the greatest indignation because the democratic state
committee voted not to allow each man
of the party to express his individual
will at the poles in the nomination of
candidates. You understand this do you
or not? Then how is it that you can
not sympathize with high spirited
women whose minds have been trained
to think and who have strength of
character and opinions of their own
with the love of freedom aglow in their
breasts, when they desire to be accorded the right, privileges or power
of a voice in the government where
their lot is cast?
You say: In the three factors that
control modern civilization her position
is pre-eminent—home, church and
school.&quot; If by pre-eminence you mean
she is more in evidence than man in
these three institutions, I grant you 'tis
true, in the home she is more continuously present, in the church and
school she is largely in the majority.
But if by pre-eminence you mean she
controls either of these, then is it true
that no statement could be more erroneous. The laws of Tennessee gives
the man the sole right to decide where
the family shall live, the wife has no
right in personal property, the husband
is bound to respect, consequently does
not own furniture of the home. The
man to be sure cannot sell the house
unless   the   wife   signs   the   deed,   but
there is very little difficulty in the majority of cases here, the husband controls the family income and this can
easily be withheld from the use of the
wife if she does not come to terms.
The hand that holds the purse strings,
is  the  hand  that  rules  the  home.
In the marriage ceremony the man
says: &quot;With all my worldly goods I
thee endow, whereas until the last few
years when if he owns real estate the
law requires the signature of the
wife to a deed of sale, he really gave
her nothing at all. The bride says nothing about giving him anything but
happiness to obey, while the truth of
the matter is she gives him everything.
When she leaves the church door with
his wife the sheriff can levy upon presents to satisfy the husband's creditors.
Is it very strange that any woman
should object to this? Except in the
Christian Science Church and a few
small sects, women hold absolutely
none of the offices in churches, therefore cannot possibly control them in
any sense. In the schools it is the same,
women fill subordinate positions In
large numbers because they come
cheap.
Now is any one to blame for this
state of affairs? Not at all. The growth
if the world is by evolution and in degrees so small as to be almost imperceptible.
It is only after development of great
character that people are willing to
accord to others the rights they pre-
tend for themselves. One of these days
the majority of men will develop to a
high degree of intelligent understanding of another's rights and evolve a
character so large and generous that
it will refuse to withhold from mother
wife and sister the rights of citizenship
in this republican government. In time
an increasing number of women will
grow in mentality until the pleasure
in a fifty-dollar hat, a Parisian gown,
or a game of bridge or a pink tea will
be eclipsed by the enjoyment gained
by the study of great and fundamental
principles of conduct and exercise of
power which comes from enlarged 
responsibilities   and   opportunities.
In the meantime Mr. Editor, you are
right. &quot;There is no use to fret,&quot; but
let us agitate because agitation brings
instruction, by which knowledge is
grained and wisdom increased and in
the end righteousness will be made to
prevail, for &quot;God is in His heaven.
&quot;All's right with the world.&quot;
L.   CROZIER   FRENCH.

<dc:description>ENFRANCHISEMENT OF
THE AMERICAN WOMAN
Arguments Against Woman's
Suffrage Answered by Principles of Good Government.
&quot;The Principles of Government Applied to Women's Enfranchisement&quot; is
the subject of a paper by Mrs. L.
Crozier French, president of the Knox-
ville Equal Suffrage League. Mrs.
French has read widely on the subject
which she treats logically in this paper,
answering the common arguments
against suffrage with arguments that
noted statesmen and orators have used
in pleading for national independence.
The subject is one that is attracting
widespread attention and the following
paper is one that should prove of general interest.
The paper is as follows:
Says   Benjamin   Franklin:     &quot;Liberty
or freedom   consists in having an  actual   share    in     the    appointment     of
those  who  frame  the  laws,   and   who
are to be the guardians of every man's
life,    property   and   peace,   for   the   all 
of one  man  is  as  dear to him  as the 
all   of another.&quot;    Is  not  this   true  of 
every woman as well as of every man ? i
Franklin   continues:
  &quot;The poor man has  an  equal  right, 
but more need to have representatives
in the   legislature than the rich  one.&quot;
How great a truth is here set forth.
Those who are powerless through poverty need the protection  afforded    by
the  ballot.      Custom   has  decreed   for
centuries that man must  have charge
of the finances; hence, women may be
considered poor as a class.
  Nature,  aided  and   abetted  by  custom,
has made woman weak physical -
ly, and for this   cause another  reason
arises why she  should   have the  pro-
 tection   of  the  vote.     But  some     say
 women are represented  by men,     not
making  note   of  the   fact   that     many
 women  have  neither   father,   husband,
 brothers or cousins.    But let   us   hear
Franklin   on   this   sort   of   representa-
tion:      &quot;They  who  have  no  voice  nor
vote in the electing  of  representatives
do   not   enjoy   liberty,   but   are   absolutely   enslaved   to   those     who    have
votes and to their representatives,   for
to   be  enslaved   is  to  have   governors
whom other men have set over us, and 
be  subject, to   laws  made by  the  rep- 
resentatives of   others,  without   having
had representatives of our own to give
consent in our behalf.&quot; i
Distasteful   as   the  statement   is    to
men that women are politically slaves,
the  fact  must    be  acknowledged    by
reasonable people.   Here is what James
Otis says of the sort of representation
 women  have   had:     &quot;No  such  phrase
 as  virtual    representation     was    ever
 known   in   law   or   constitution.  It   is
altogether    a     subtlety     and    illusion,
wholly   unfounded   and   absurd.       We
 must  not  be  cheated   by     any    such
 phantom or other trick of law or poli-
tics.&quot;     If no   man  can represent    any
other   man,   how   much    less   can   any
man   represent   a   woman?     Can   any
man represent the feelings of a mother?     The    most     frequent objection
one    hears    urged    against    the    enfranchisement  of   women  is   that   politics   is   too   corrupt   for   good   women
to take part in.    Could any reason   be
more absurd?    Women   must live  under the government conducted by these
bad   politicians.     If   women    are      the
better, why not  let them try  to  make
some   improvement?     Why   tie     their
hands and   make  them stand idly    by 
while  unworthy men are  put  in  high
places to rule over  them?
A violation of the constitution of the
United  States   that is practiced  in all
except four of the states today is the
taxation   of   the   property   of   women.
Read what James Otis said about taxation,    without    representation:      &quot;The
very act of taxing exercised over those
who   are   not   represented.   appears   to
me to be depriving them of   their most
essential    right    as   freemen,   and     if
continued,   seems   to  be,   in  effect,   an
entire  disfranchisement  of  every  civil
right.    For  what  civil   right is  worth
a rush, after a man's property is subject to be taken from him at pleasure
without his consent?    If a man is not
his own assessor in person or by deputy, his  liberty  is  gone, and he is entirely   at   the  mercy  of  others.&quot;     And
this is true,   even   in a greater degree
of women, because of their impecunious condition and their physical weakness?.
No greater example could be given
Of the necessity of every class and
every individual being represented at
the polls than is here shown of these
great statesmen, Otis and Franklin,
who could point out so clearly these
human rights and yet who did not demand them for women, so far as I
know. When individuals or classes
are fighting for their own rights they
are apt to neglect those of others. So
the laws concerning women have been
always the last to be changed as civilization advanced, because
have not looked after the
themselves. Some have been too poor,
weak and ignorant to do so and
others have been basking in the lap
of luxury, protected and cared for by
male relatives, and have been heedless
and indifferent to the needs of others
except in the way of giving pity and
charity.
Before   the   close   of  this  twentieth
century   I   dare   to   predict   that   class
slavery  will  be     banished     from     the
Anglo-Saxon world  and women,  being
free,   there   will   be seen   a   new era
about  to  dawn     on     earth,    and
prophecy  contained   in   the   song     the
angels   sang will begin  to  be realized
'Peace on earth, good will to men.'

<dc:description>ONE RESOLUTION
THAT WAS SIDE-STEPPED
At the East Tennessee Teachers
Association held in this city on March
21 and 22, a resolution endorsing the
election of women on boards of Education was submitted to the resolution committee. This was calmly ignored by the committee. In his report, the chairman of the committee
referred to a &quot;tabled&quot; resolution, but
not till afterward did any but a
chosen few know what that resolution
contained.
This committee submitted excellent
resolutions of commendation and
thanks to the state superintendent and
our present legislature for their great
educational work. It was also very
careful to thank everybody connected
with the management of the convention.
But doesn't it seem too bad that
this committee did not seize the
chance to make the Association stand
for progressive, fair-minded justice?
It seems superfluous to tarry to defend this resolution. Any one can
easily see that an educated woman,
who is not a wage earner, could make
a more efficient member of a board
of education than a busy man of affairs. What time have business men
to study the problems of school organizations? Or to investigate the
present school conditions? Absolutely
none.
About four-fifths of the members of
the East Tennessee Teacher's Association are women and these poor confiding creatures never dreamed that
they wore being betrayed but played
&quot;Mutt to their Jeff&quot; most beautifully.
But like Mutt they will sometime
&quot;fall on&quot; and then.—
—MAE TREADWELL.	
Dost thou hear the bugle calling—
Calling thee to take the field?
'Tis a battle all are waging;
Thou must fight or thou must yield.
'Tis the battle of the ages—
No man may the gage refuse;
Eight on one side or the other—
No man can decline to choose.
If from off the field thou fliest,
Even then thou art a foe;
Who&quot; for Truth no sword uplifteth,
He for Error strikes a blow.
He who bravely fights must conquer;
None can e'er defeat be;
For to soldiers in God's battle
Death itself is victory.
From the hymns of the REV. MINOT

<dc:description>EQUAL
SUFFRAGE DEPARTMENT

Editors:—Mrs. Julia Lucky,  President of Equal Suffrage League, and
Mrs. Sara H. Hood.
Suffragists throughout the country
are rejoicing over the fact that the
Tennessee Legislature has at last
passed a woman's property rights bill.
This is a step in the right direction.
The next step, it is hoped will be the
long stride that shall carry the state
to the forefront of Progress—namely
the passage of the suffrage amendment.
Apropos of the position taken by
Mrs. Arnstein in her article entitled
&quot;The Price of Virtue&quot;—it will doubt-
less be remembered that the concensus of opinion expressed during
the  recent convention  of   the  Illinois
Vice Commission in Washington City,
was, that the question of wages, except in certain classes of untrained,
incompetent workers, plays a small
part in the down fall of girls. Stan-
ley W. Finch, special agent of the department of justice; Dr. W. C. Wood-
ward, health officer, of the District of
Columbia; Mr. Robert Barrett, son of
the general supervisor of the Florence
Crittenton Homes; Mrs. Adolph Kahn,
president of the Jewish Women's Al- 
liance, and others testified that in a large
 majority of the cases investigated the girls were hounded to their
ruin by vicious men, either to gratify 
their own passions or to swell the coffers of those most depraved of all
criminals—the White Slavers. &quot;The
social evil,&quot; said one speaker, &quot;will
continue to flourish like the Green
Bay Tree, regardless of the wage question.
as long as false ideas  of    manhood and the double standard of mor-
ality  prevails.&quot;     On   the  other    hand
facts   were adduced  to  show that  ignorance,
 vanity,   extravagance,  and  a
lack   of  moral     fiber  are     the     chief
uses that render so many girls of all
classes and conditions, easy victims of 
designing, unscrupulous men. Among
the various remedies advocated for
social reform at this convention, none
were more practical than those suggested by Mrs. Harvey Wiley, namely
Sex hygiene instruction for the young
 women police, and the full enfran- 
chizement  of  women   everywhere.
_ 
The movement for Suffrage in Ten- 
nessee as a state-wide movement, is as
yet young. We must never forget, 
however, that in Tennessee for many,
many years, there have been devoted
 spirits who through ridicule, and dis- 
couragement, have kept the lamp of 
woman's advancement trimmed and 
burning until now a younger genera- 
tion  has been awakened to light their
torches at this patient flame, and to
move forward, throwing this light
into dark corners where before no
light of betterment for women has
ever shone. We want the men of Tennessee to realize what it is the women
of Tennessee have done for the State,
from the days of the first settlers in
the wilderness, down through the horrors of war, of reconstruction, of
poverty, of the struggle for rehabilitation,  to  this hour;     to realize the
strength, the wisdom, the patience, the
great, undying love of their women,
and, realizing all this, to give her in
the ballot,, not only the power to help
herself and her children, but, as comrade and friend, to help the men of
Tennessee..—Sarah Barnwell Elliot.
Pres. Tenn. Equal Suffrage League.      I
AMENDMENT TO THE
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
THE  RIGHT OF    CITIZENS    OF
THE UNITED.    STATES    TO     VOTE,
SHALL   NOT   BE   DENIED     OR     A-
BRIDGED       BY       THE       UNITED
STATES,     OR     BY        ANY     STATE
THEREOF,  ON ACCOUNT OF SEX.&quot;
This is the wording of the proposed
amendment to  the  Federal   Constitution,
   agreed   upon   by   the   committee
appointed to frame it.    Suffragists of
the North,  East, South and West are
united in the feeling that various pro-
pitious     circumstances     render     this
occasion—the opening of the new con-
gress—the chance of a life time to secure  the  long    coveted     amendment
President Wilson, therefore, has been
bombarded with resolutions and    letters urging him to  embody the   
recommendation in his message.    Senator
Thomas of Colorado, Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Woman Suffrage
announces   that   the   amendment   will
certainly   be   introduced   and   actively
pushed.    Moreover, it is reported that
a company of 531 women—one from
each congressional  district and two at
large from each State—will march to
the Capitol on  Monday    morning    to
present to each Senator    and    Representative
 a petition from home, asking
their support for the measure.    Surely
the well laid plans cannot fail.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Municipal Suffrage

No. 4. What the women might,
could, would, or should do, to make
Knoxville a better place in which to
live, if they had the ballot and one
of the commissioners was a woman to
look   after   our   municipal  housekeeping.

If all women felt fully the responsibilities
 of their position  they would demand the ballot  for   the
protection of home and children.
Child welfare depends on woman's work.
Why do we find the study of the
welfare of children such an ail important study at the present day? Because
it has been neglected  in the past. Men
said women needed no education to look
after the simple wants of the home.
Women did not need to be independent
thinkers, their fathers, brothers and husbands could direct them as to their duties   and   course  of   conduct.
Thus it came about that only in exceptional cases were women able to overcome this handicap and do their whole
duty. We are beginning to awaken to
the fact' that not only did this suppression of [wo]man's intellect and will prevent
her from composing great music, painting  beautiful pictures and writing great
dramas, but it prevented her from doing
the great work for which nature intend-
ed her. In consequence of this mandate
against woman's development, the human mothers in many instances have
been but little better than animal mothers.
We are beginning to wake to the fact
of the great mortality of infants, owing
to mothers ignorance. Mothers are beginning to know that the blindness of
hosts of children is due to the sins of
their fathers. While mothers were kept
in ignorance of the evils of impurity they
were careless in demanding it. Oh, the
sin and sorrow that the human family
has been made to bear by the short
sightedness in men, that they did not
insist that the mothers of the race should
be educated, even if all others had to
go without. The 'Highest educational advantages are now within the reach of
women and what do we see? That the 
state is slow to avail itself of the serv- 
ices of competent women.
For twenty-live years women have
been educating themselves in clubs to
deal with all sorts of questions, yet in
the southern states few of them are invited, to help in the public work. They may
do volunteer work of a splendid character,
 but the state ignores them entirely.  In Knoxville we have splendid organizations of mothers connected with all our schools, yet a law was passed by our legislature as late as 1907, which bars
women from being members of county
boards of education. Why was this
done? In the interest of education?
No, indeed, it was done in the interests
of the professional politicians. The politicians thought they could manage
school boards composed of men with
more ease than those composed of men
and women. No doubt they were right.
Our leading schoolmen are loud in their
cry concerning the illiteracy of Tennessee, but what one of them has asked
to have women given an official call?
No they will use the women as the
monkey did the cat's paw, to pull the
chestnuts out of the fire, but they take
good care not to give the women any
of the chestnut's.
We need women on our school boards
and we need them badly. Our public
school children have no mother, but are
left to the cold comfort of a male parent
only. How long will man's ego continue so large as to make him blind
to plain truths? And now long will
women consent to he blindfolded and
 ['muzzled' handwritten on clipping].  L. CROZIER FRENCH.

<dc:description>MUST WORK FOR POSTERITY
ASSERTS SUFFRAGIST HEAD
To obtain the best possible fathers
all men must be taught justice.
Must Share in Making Laws.
To  obtain   the  best  possible  condi-
tions under which children may grow
to  maturity,  women  must    share     in
 making the laws in the    shadow    of
 which they and their children     must
live.
She who is not afraid to face    the
 world to  obtain these  things is    womanly
A woman is most truly womanly
who is most truly the universal mother.
A  womanly   woman   does  not     rest
content  before  her own hearth while 
the  children  of   others  less  fortunate 
women perish because of    man-made
laws.
Gives Thought to Her Sister
     A   womanly   woman   does   not   rest
content in her  own home while    her
sister wanders the  street homeless.
A womanly woman is not too concerned with her own life and duties to 
remember the rights of other women.
The woman who endeavors to in- 
fluence the minds of others because 
she is a woman is not womanly. The
woman who appeals for justice on 
intellectual grounds in the world of 
things is womanly.
The willingness to  fight    for    that
which is right is womanly.
She Works for Posterity.
The womanly woman, when she}
hears that her functions in life is hard i
and that the road she must travel is!
stony and tiresome, prays in her heart'
to be shown the way to make it less
hard and stony and tiresome for those
who come after her.
A womanly woman does not cry for
a change in her duties, but only that
she may learn to understand better
exactly what her duties are and be
willing to shoulder the full responsibility of them.
A womanly woman knows that
while she forgets her duty towards
others her duty toward herself is unperformed.
Should Respect Self First.
The womanly woman cannot reach
the best within herself while she labors beneath a sense of inequality. She
knows that to have others respect her
she must first be able to respect herself.
The womanly woman knows the pur-
poses of the two sexes can never be
identical and that therefore the world
walks lame till both sexes are permitted to work equally and freely for
their common good.
She who is truly womanly cannot
be harmed by contact with the world.
She goes out into the world and labors to convert the world to the stand-
ards of true womanliness.—Washing
ton Star.</dc:description>

<dc:description>PiNCHOT PRAISES
 WOMAN VIEWPOINT
When Human Welfare is Con- 
idered, Woman Suffrage
Becomes Certainty, He Says.
Clifford Pinchot has come out strongly
for  woman  suffrage,  and  on  somewhat 
novel grounds.    He writes in  the Penn-
sylvania Suffrage News:--
&quot;To my mind the distinguishing fact 
in the menial attitude of our time is the 
relatively tremendous weight we say on 
general human welfare.    This disposition 
to accept the health, happiness, and suc- 
cess of men and women in the mass as 
the criterion and  touchstone of  civilization is comparatively new.    It seems to
me  well  within   the  bounds  of truth  to 
say that it has made more progress with- 
in  the United States in  the last twelve 
months   than   in   the.   twelve   proceeding
years,  and the advance  in  the next  de- 
cade bids  fair  to  be only   less striking.
 &quot;The moment    the    effective political 
units  in  any    commonwealth     begin   to 
measure national success by human wel-
fare,  not  merely  as an intellectual  pro- 
position but as a practical basis for con- 
crete    action,    that   moment    the    equal
participation   of   women   in   government 
becomes  a.  certainty.     The     reason   is 
simple.     Women     as  a    whole  have   a 
larger stake in human welfare than men 
for   they  are   the   mothers.     They   bear
the heavier share of the burden.  Their 
lives and  their   rights  are  more  sacred
than those of men.
&quot;Women and children first is no mean-
inless [sic.]   phrase,    and   represents    no    accidental custom.    It rests on the obvious
truth that the future is more important 
to the race  than the present,  and  that 
in   times  of peril  those who   prepare  or
embody the future are best worth saving.
&quot;Equal suffrage is coming, as it ought
to come, for the good and sufficient reason  that the welfare or the race and to
its future,  the work and point of view
of  the   women   is
more   important   than
the work and point of view of the
men?&quot;'  --The Woman's Journal.

<dc:description>WOMAN WITH THE BALLOT
Dr. H. C. Morrison of Louisville, Ky.,
sets   forth   the   political   expediency   of 
woman suffrage:— 
Nine states  in  our great Union  have 
conferred upon woman the right of fran- 
chise.    California, Utah. Wyoming, Colo- 
rado, Kansas.   Idaho.  Oregon,  Washing-
ton and Arizona, have given tto[sic.] woman 
the privilege of the ballot.    The indica-
tions are that other states will soon fall 
into line, and it is reasonable to suppose 
in   the  not   distant   future   the   woman-
hood of the United States will have equal 
rights with men at the polls.    The drift 
is so strong in the direction of suffrage
that politicians will be very rare who will
undertake   to   turn    the   onmoving  tide
backward. 
The increase of representation in the
states granting suffrage, will powerfully
influence other states to increase their
representation by increasing their number of voters. However conservative
any part of the country may be on the
subject, no section will be willing or could
hardly afford to entirely outclassed in
representation from other parts of
nation because its women were deprived
of the ballot. Men will reason that if
the  entire   west   gives the ballot to its
women, the east   must do so in order to
compete  with  the west on the floor of
congress;  the same will hold good with
reference to north and south.  The indications are now that the tide of sympathy with suffrage will continue to advance with the idea and it becomes a practical fact.

In the great battle against the liquor
traffic we have been profoundly grieved
and outraged when we have seen illiterate negroes flock to the polls and vote
for the saloon., while intelligent and consecrated women whose offspring were to become the victims of the whiskey traffic, had to remain in subdued silence.
 Any fair mind   must     admit   that  it  hardly
looks  the  proper  thing for  an  illiterate
carriage driver who  pays practically  no
taxes, and is scarcely able to give reason
for his actions, And is often only the tool
in the hands of designing politicians, to
cast a vote to increase taxation, or heap
other  burdens     and     inconveniences  on 
property   owners,   when   the   intelligent, 
cultured woman whose carriage he drives, 
who pays large taxes, must remain silent 
and  inactive.     It  sounds, quite   reasonable when we are 
told     that  taxation  without representation
 is not in harmony with the American idea or with the high
standards of equity.

There are many reason why the citizens of this republic should revere the name of Abraham Lincoln--not the least among them being the fact that he was the first prominent public man in America to advocate women's suffrage, in that memorable declaration which has not become a classic.  &quot;I go for all s_____the privileges (missing) government who assist in bearing (missing)</dc:description>

Legal Status of Women in Tennessee  and The Present Legislature
   Since Ossoli circle in 1909 passed a
resolution asking the Tennessee Federation of Women's club to make a thorough investigation of the legal status of
Tennessee women, an agitation has been
almost continually going on, until now
the meekest women in the state no
longer say they have all the rights they
want, but acknowledge they would like
to control their own property and have
some share in the guardianship of their
children.
The present legislature in one respect
will be unique, for if all plans are carried out, for the first time in the history
of the state members of the legislature
will realize that the people of the state
are interested in having laws made for 
the bettering of the condition of mothers
and wives.
The  statutes  of  Tennessee  on  record
at present appear to be primarily to protect men, especially husbands.   The man
who marries a rich woman is perfectly
secured in his rights to her wealth, and
there is no adequate punishment for him
if he fails to provide for wife and children.    He can squander all on dissolute
companions   and go entirely unpunished
as far as  Tennessee law  is concerned.
Some Bills to be Presented.
The Federation of Women's clubs and the bar
association will  see that a  bill
is  presented  asking for the  removal   of
the   coverture   of   the   old   English   common
 law   from   married   women.     This
would  allow  the married  woman   to  re-
tain full control of her property.     It is
 possible a  bill may be presented  asking 
 that   mothers  be  made   joint   guardians
 with fathers of their children.
Pensions for Mothers.
G.   H.   Robertson,   president   of
the Tennessee   branch  of   the   Mothers' congress, 
will have presented a bill asking
for a small pension for mothers who
have   small   children   and   no   means  of
support. Several states have passed such 
bills believing it will cost much  less  to 
enable the mother to stay at home and 
take  care  of  the  children   than  for  her
to work out of her home while the chil- 
dren   run   on   the   street   and   get   their
training for the penitentiary.
Kindergarten Bill.
The   Mothers'   congress   also   have   a
bill to be presented asking that the kindergarten be made a part of the schools
of the stare.
Women on School Boards.
Another   bill   this   legislature   will   be
asked   to   pass   is   one   making   women 
eligible to school boards.
Not until 1907 was the law passed
that members of county boards of education,  &quot;'must be qualified  voters.&quot;
I have made diligent inquiry as to
why such a stricture was put upon the
women of Tennessee, when other states
were giving their daughters such positions and even more important ones.
I was told this was done to please the
professional politicians, because they regard
boards of education as among their
best political assets and they would not
find it quite so easy to manipulate
women members of the boards. So our
schools must suffer to please the politician who has been preying upon poor
Tennessee- so successfully for so long a
time. We should have a law making it
obligatory to have two members of every
board of education in  the state  women.
Votes for Women.
The   best   lawyers   in   the   state   have
been   consulted   and   they    express   the
opinion that no constitutional amendment
is   necessary   to   give   the   vote   to   the
women of Tennessee, but that the legislature   has   full   power     to   extend   the
right of suffrage  as there  is nothing in the
constitution    forbidding   it.      It    is
likely,   therefore,   that  such   a   bill   will
be brought before the present legislature.
Many of the leading men of Tennessee
are  for   the   enfranchisement  of  women
and   it would  not  surprise some  people
if this legislature were to pass a bill to
that   effect.     All   intelligent     men   and
women   concede   that     the     victory   for
equal suffrage has been won and it only
remains for the remaining states to make
formal  surrender.     Why should Tennessee
 wait  to come in to line at the end,
 when it will no longer be respectable to
carry arms against the cause of women.

<dc:description>THE TASK WHICH TENNESSEE
SUFFRAGISTS HAVE SET FOR THEMSELVES
SOME LOCAL FACTS—(GROWTH OF SUFFRAGE IN GENERAL,.
By    Carrie  C. Callaway
Like  New  York  suffragists, the Ten-
nessee   suffragists   have  set a task
themselves.    For the New York women
it is &quot;Suffrage in 1913,&quot; which date (owing to
 the  fact  that in that state an
amendment to the constitution has to pass
two successive legislatures before
it becomes a law) is the earliest at which
the question can reach the voters. At
that time Woman's suffrage is sure to
pass in New York state for all New
York political parties have indorsed the
submission of a woman's suffrage
amendment  to  their platforms.
The task that Tennessee suffragists
have set for themselves is to make Tennessee the first equal suffrage state in
the south and it seems to me that the
Tennessee woman's task is going to be
the hardest to accomplish.
And why? There are several reasons.
In New York state equal suffrage has
practically arrived. The question there
has been agitated for forty-four years,
from the time of Susan B. Anthony and
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who worked
for the political emancipation of women
in 1868, and the sentiment for woman's
suffrage in that state is now too strong
and too universal to be longer disregarded.
But in Tennessee we have not this
mass of sentiment in sympathy with the
cause. It is comparatively of late years
that the matter has been generally discussed
in the press and in polite society.
it is only within the past half dozen
years that equal suffrage has been regarded other than a joke in this section.
Far be it from me, a native of the
&quot;cracker state&quot; to disparage the south's
fair name, but it is a fact that the
group of states known as &quot;The South&quot;
are the most conservative in the country, and are the last to give up their
traditions and customs; to them changes
come slowly in all departments of life
and especially are they slow to see that
the granting of political independence
to women will not detract from their
charm and womanliness but rather add
to it dignity and  self-respect.
For those reasons—which might be enlarged upon indefinitely—the Tennessee
suffragists have set for themselves no
easy task. If  they accomplish their goal,
they cannot sit idly by and dream of the
beauties   of   a    society   where   man   and
woman stand shoulder 
to   shoulder   in
solving the larger social and political
problems of the home, city and state.
They must work; they must create favorable sentiment; they must agitate—not
in a militant manner, but in the way
the women of the south know how to
work; in the way they worked in pioneer
days, in Revolutionary days; in the days
of '61-'63, and in the days of the reconstruction period. The woman of the
south, now struggling for her political
independence, is this same woman working out her destiny now, as then. And
they must work together. Every woman
in the state, who is interested in the
cause, should, connect herself, in some
way, with the movement and do her
part. If the women of Tennessee WILL
work together they will succeed in making the Volunteer state the first in the
southland to grant the franchise to its
women for week by week the gates
swing more widely open and more southern  women pass through them.        
Some State Facts.
As  the result of interest manifest in
Tennessee in woman's suffrage within
the past two years, this stale has been
put, by national leaders, in the list of
those most likely to immediately follow
in the footsteps of the nine equal suffrage states already in existence. Dr.
Anna Shaw, president of the national organization, says that Michigan, South
Dakota, Maine, Missouri, Montana and
Tennessee are the states most apt to
grant equal suffrage in 1913 and 1914.
Kentucky and Virginia rank next to Ten-
nessee   in  the south, in interest in the cause.

The organization of the Tennessee
Equal Suffrage association was effected
about 1885, but at that time it was
very weak and little was known or cared
about equal suffrage in the stale. In
fact the cause practically died after the
organization of this association and was
not renascent until about two years ago.
It was not until the fall of 1910 that
any vital interest was manifest in Tennessee in the cause.    It is true that be-
tween 1885 and 1910  here were periods
when the movement seemed to take on
new life but these periods were brief and
were followed by periods of indifference.
But since 1910 the growth of the
movement has been prodigious and there
are now equal suffrage leagues in
Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga,
Morristown, Jackson—with leading
women in other smaller towns interested.
The state league, of which Miss Sarah
Barnwell Elliott, of Sewanee, is president, now numbers its membership into
the thousands. There seems to have
been a concerted awakening throughout
the state, and there is no doubt about
the permanency and potency of this
awakening.
With sentiment growing, as it is in
this state, for equal suffrage, it is no
wonder that Tennessee has been placed
in the list of &quot;probable&quot; equal suffrage
states for 1913-14. At the convention
of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage association, held in Nashville January 6 and
7, the delegates adopted as their slogan,
&quot;Make Tennessee the first southern equal
suffrage state,&quot; and the women of this
state, with the courage of their convictions behind them, will soon be in a
position    to   demand    their   enfranchise-
ment.
Some National Facts.
The rapid growth of equal suffrage
sentiment in Tennessee and the south
since 1910 is only an echo of the wider
national movement. There are now nine
equal suffrage states in the Union. They
are Wyoming, Washington, Utah, Idaho,
Colorado, California, Kansas, Oregon
and Arizona. The three last states went
for equal suffrage in the November 1912,
elections and in Michigan the cause
failed by only 600 votes. It is certain
that Michigan will be won by the women
in 1913.
The number of women now entitled
to vote total three million. According to
reliable statistics, sixty-six per cent of
these women will actually exercise their
suffrage rights. At the next general
election, therefore, two million American
women will go to the polls as full-fledged
citizens. This great new political force,
held by women, is sufficient, if acting
in unison, to turn the scale in national
issues. The whole Pacific coast is free
soil for women and they can now claim
about one-fifth of the states in the Union.
The equal suffrage states can cast today
seventy  votes  in the electoral   college.
After New York state is won in 1915,
a national campaign will be inaugurated,
for equal suffrage is rapidly becoming a
question for the nation to decide, instead
of the separate states. Two-thirds of
the states can call a convention to
amend the national constitution; three-
fourths are needed to adopt an amendment. In that roll call Idaho, for instance, will loom as large as Pennsylvania. The enfranchisement of Women
will,  in 1916, be a national issue.
On November 21, last, delegates from
all the suffrage organizations in the
country met in convention at Philadelphia, This was the largest and most
significant political gathering of women
ever held in the United States, a historic
event. Distinguished speakers at this
convention were: Baroness Bertha yen
Suttner, the great advocate of international peace and the winner of the Nobel
peace prize in 1905; Carrie Chapman
Catt, president of the International
Woman's Suffrage Alliance, who has just
returned from a two years' tour of the
world on which she investigated the
social evil in every country on earth;
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of
the National American Woman Suffrage
association; Jane Addams, Harriet Stanton Blatch, Mrs. O.H. P. Belmont, M.
Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr,
and  others.
The biennial convention of the International Woman Suffrage alliance will
be held at Budapest, June 15-20, 1913,
Delegates from twenty-eight countries
will attend. The city council of Budapest
has contributed $5,00 toward this convention. This will be the most important
gathering of women ever held in the
world.
And so the onward march of equal
suffrage take its way. The six million
women breadwinners in the United
States will not much longer be deprived
of the protection of the ballot nor of
their inalienable right to life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>THE PRICE OF VIRTUE
Morality   at   Eight   Dollars   a
Week—The Minimum.
If the price of girls is dependent on
eight dollars per week (the minimum
wage) over which Chicago is at
present so loudly clamoring, then indeed has our standard of morality fallen very low. The investigating committee has proven nothing beyond the
fact that girls paid less than eight
dollars per week, cannot maintain
their respectability, but must resort to
immoral living in order to keep up appearances. This seems a strange
reason for transgression, a devious
winding from the path of virtue.
Is Virtue to be  maintained by dollars     and   cents?       Are     department
stores, houses of refuge for the weak
fibred,   weak-kneed   girls   and   young
women who have no morals excepting
those that are  bought and paid for?
The stores would  do well to establish
 houses of rectitude for such young women,
instead  of thrusting them  upon
department stores to keep straight at
 eight dollars per week.
Virtue that can be bought at this
 minimum wage will not be virtue of
long standing; for eight dollars brings
more demand than four or five dollars
and the accessories that complete the
living wage of eight dollars is liable
and propable to lead to grosser wrong
and greater immoral practice, than
that at a lower wage.
The legislature is imposing a very
different taste upon the employee.
Many girls entering stores have no
standard of right conduct and right
living. The fault is in their home environment where virtue should be
inculcated and implanted so deeply 
that the vanities of life will not lead to
ruin, for after all. it is not the low living wage that leads to girls going astray. It is the glamor of life, the love
of grandeur and luxury, the longing
for the delicate accessories and comforts. The wage of eight dollars per
week will not naturally benefit the
girls in this way. The heart longing
will be just as keen at eight as at five
dollars a week, the means of securing
them will also be just the same.
The investigators, seem to take no 
consideration of the fact that there are 
hundreds of thousands of pure, honest
upright girls working for their daily
sustenance to whom this investigation
is an insult and a slur. By what right
do they cast aspersions upon the 
characters of so many honest bread 
winners?
It is libel that should be punishable,
for such reflections upon ones character and  reputation  demands explanations and calls loudly for redress. Let
the honest girls of toil rise up in denunciation of the ignominy at present
being assailed  and  branded.     Human
nature is human nature, and we cannot
legislate  against it.     There  are     men
and women, boys and girls, whose instincts and ruling passion are for the
immoral life, cannot be gainsaid.    The
minimum wage will never affect these
They  must  be  placed  at  a     different
angle with regard to  human life,  before their moral status can be chang-
ed.    Neither eight dollars, ten dollars,
nor  fifteen   dollars  will     ever     cause
them to change their physical     emotions.    Virtue  that  can be gauged by
the minimum  or the  maximum wage
is not water tight virtue.    Department
stores should not be made to stand the
brunt   of   this   investigation   of     wage 
and morality, nor should suspicion be 
cast upon  the innocent.  The least ef- 
ficient  should  not  be  forced  into the 
place of the most efficient.    It    is    a 
line   artificially  drawn  to  repress  the 
best activities of the more capable.
Chicago is digging a pit for its wage 
earning girls, into which many will
heedlessly fall. She is showing them 
how immorality is more lucrative 
than honest labor, discouraging their 
efforts at bread winning, and her loud
clamorous cry of virtue at eight dollars per week, will make more converts
to a life of shame and ease, than to a 
living wage life of toil and struggle.

<dc:description>The Really Vital Question.
It  is not a question of &quot;will, we get
it?&quot; but of &quot;what will we do with it
when we do get it?'&quot; So, unless something should happen to turn back the
wheels of national evolution, we had
better begin to study the great science
of statescraft, so as to be able to make
intelligent use of the privileges of the
ballot. And incidentally, some ingenuous woman might turn her attention
towards devising a suitable costume in
which the sex could appear at &quot;these dreadful
 polls&quot; more modestly than some of 
them appear at church or on
the streets  during the present prevailing modes.

The Ballot and The Schools
By MRS. HELEN   L. GRENFELL,
Former State Superintendent of Public Instruction for Colorado.
Women  have  always     had     school
suffrage   in   Colorado.   The   fact   has
acted as a preventive of the nomination   of     obnoxious     persons.     Judge
Louis   W.   Cunningham    of    Colorado
City,  writes:
&quot;In Colorado City, from 1883 to
1893, there were six mayors who were
saloonkeepers. During two or three
years there were three saloonkeepers
in the council; and for one year we
had a mayor, and three councilmen
who lived on the woes of others. Since
1894, when women came to their own
there has never been a saloonkeeper
elected to any office in Colorado City.
Women have always had a vote at
school elections in this state, and, as
a consequence, while saloon men were
on the city council, not one ever served on a school board in our town.&quot;
What is true in Colorado City is
true, with hardly an exception,
throughout the state. It is alleged that
the voting woman forgets the welfare
of her children. Statistics are not
thrilling, but they are convincing.
Nothing tells the location of our
hearts more surely than the figures
of the tax list.  According to age and
long establishment, the thirteen original colonies should lead the United
States in the educational procession.
Let us consider the per capita expenditure of the  total population, for the
education of their young folks in
these  states.
Massachusetts, $4.96; New Hampshire,
 $2,79; 
Rhode      Island, $3.79; 
Connecticut, $ 3 .72;   New  York, $5.00; 
New Jersey, $3.51; Maryland, $2.12; Pennsylvania, $3.52;  Virginia, $1.07; 
Delaware, $2.46;   North   Carolina,   66 cents;
 Georgia,   97 cents.,
Over against these let us set the
$5.08 spent by Colorado, the highest
amount spent for educational purposes by any state in the Union. These
figures are from the report of the
commissioner of education, William T. Harris, for 1901-02.
But   it   may   be   urged   that   school
suffrage  is sufficient,   and     that    full-
suffrage has not assisted the Colorado
woman in  extending the scope of her
educational  work.  No one who is acquainted with  the facts will  say this.
With the school franchise only, women   found  it -up-hill   work   to   inaugurate  reforms along  educational   lines..
They  formed association and founded
&quot;free   kindergartens,&quot;     kept     up     by
philanthropic    people,    fairs, bazaars and the various means used by women everywhere.
    In   the   spring   of 1893, the year 
when the vote was to be taken on the
suffrage question  in November, for
the first time, the annual school election
 held in May became a burning
 question  throughout the state.
Thousands   of   votes   were polled where
there had been  tens and fifties.
The women proved past a per-adventure
they   would   vote.   In Denver they, for the first time, elected a woman (Mrs. Ione T. Hanna) to the school board.  
The issue was to make the
kindergarten a part of the public school system.
 The powers that were bowed to the inevitable.  Today the kindergarten is firmly established in many districts throughout the state, and many are being started as rapidly as finances permit.
The next progressive step
 was   the erection of a 
manual  training high school in Denver, and manual training departments have
been  added  to a number of schools throughout the state.
Instead of thinking loss of their
homes,   women     began     to     consider 
them   more   carefully   and   sought   to 
bring into  these     close     corporations 
something of the   scientific   spirit of
the age.   Chairs of domestic economy 
were established  in the state agricul-   
tural   college   and   the   state   normal 
school, and the professor of domestic
economy in the former has been twice 
president of the Colorado Suffrage association.  The   interest   in   the   old- 
fashioned womanly arts has increased
instead of diminishing. There is hardly a  state  where   the  school  population   is   increasing  so   rapidly.   It   has
gained 25 per cent in five years.  Colorado's  compulsory     education    laws
are  said   to   be   the  best  in   existence
anywhere.     There     is     no   difference
made in teachers' salaries on account
of  sex.
After   twenty  years'   experience   in
school work, I can say that our school
boards are    absolutely    non-political,
and party affiliation is never  considered in the appointment  of teachers.
Whilst our teachers are citizens, taking part in  public affairs, voting and
often   attending   primaries   and   conventions,  I  have  never    heard    of a
teacher being dismissed or appointed
because she was a republican or democrat,   nor   of a  member  of a  school
board   being   elected   because   he   belonged to this or that party. Generally,   both   parties   are   represented   on
the  same   board.  Sometimes  a   board
principally democratic is found in republican communities, and vice versa.
Our teachers are free to vote according to  their  own  consciences.  I  have
seen  or  heard  more  party politics  in
school matters in one block in Albany,
Buffalo   or   Philadelphia  than   in   the
103,92 5 square miles of Colorado soil.</dc:description>

<dc:description>HOW THE MOTHERS
COULD HELP THE SCHOOLS
As president of a mothers' association I am keenly interested in our
schools, and feel that if mothers were
in authority the schools would be better.
Tennessee has the unenviable reputation of being one of the most illiterate states in the Union, In 1907 a
law was passed prohibiting women
from being on school boards, just at
the time when all the other schools
in the east and north were recognizing the need of the mother. At this
time 25 per cent of the whole income
of the state was given for education,
but only a &quot;Qualified voter&quot; could be
on  the school board.
If a mother shapes the destiny of
her children in the first six years,
as she is credited with doing, she certainly should have the power to have
them educated along the lines of
their best individual abilities. A man
may reason what is best for the child,
but a mother knows intuitively what
each of her children needs, and I
 firmly believe if women were on the
school boards a great many of the
non-essentials in the present day curriculum would disappear, and vocational education would come to the
front.
By far the greatest number of our
school children will necessarily have
to earn their own living, and isn't it
the practical thing to prepare them
as far as the state can do so—to equip
them mentally, physically and morally during- their eight years of compulsory education? And if women
were empowered to have a hand in
their children's education sixty and
seventy children would never be
given to one overworked teacher. A
number she could easily handle would
be her allotment—for a mother realizes the nerve-racking- strain, at times
with her few, and she knows full well
that justice cannot be done so many
—and individual teaching and interest would soon send Tennessee high
up the ladder of literacy. For Tennessee has the brains and brawn, and I
hope the day is very near when manual training with a big &quot;M,&quot; and domestic science with a big &quot;D,&quot; embracing all , the fundamental and
practical things a boy and girl should 
know, will be taught in every school
in Tennessee.
And I am not forgetting the babies,
either. The laws of Tennessee do not
provide for the instruction of a child
under six. Who has ever visited a kindergarten and will not admit that a
little tot is taught courtesy and consideration for the other children,
neatness in the finish of their baby
work on valentines for mother and
dad, and orderliness in the putting
away of their little play things? I
think we would all gain much by frequent visits to the kindergarten, and
I am hoping and praying that the
free kindergarten bill that comes up
before the legislature soon will unanimously carry. For I am asking every
one of you—brothers and sisters, too,
to talk and read on suffrage, and see
what the women can do. It isn't only
 for your child and mine, but for all
the children of Tennessee that I make
this plea.
So  here's hoping you'll all   help.  too.
And let the women show their hands.
And, brothers; if you'll help us safely-
through.
 The     children    will    profit    by    our
demands
MRS. T. P. MILLER.</dc:description>

<dc:description>AM OPEN LETTER
To Dr. Ayres, President of the
University of Tennessee.
Dear  Sir:—The   press reports you   as
having delivered an address at Memphis
to the graduates of the public schools
and quotes the two sentences which follow:—
&quot;Woman's suffrage tends to destroy
the home and with it the sweetness of
human life.&quot;
&quot;All this business of women pushing
themselves into the sual avocations
followed by men is destructive to the
homes &quot;
A formal public utterance by one occupying a high position naturally attracts
attention and is calculated to have much
influence.
No greater problems for solution have
ever come to any nation than the two
subjects touched upon by you in the
sentences quoted above: those of the
suffrage, and industrialism.
Every human being, man, woman and
child, is vitally interested and should be
impartially considered in the study of
the problem.—
1.—How are the people to sustain
life?
2.—How   are   the   people   to   be   gov- 
erned ?
In   the   eyes  of  many   there  are   few 
higher positions than that of  the  presi- 
dent  of a   university;   than  that  of   the
man who stands at the head of the edu-
cational system, of a common wealth.
To reach such a position a man is supposed   to  be  versed  in   the  fundamental
principles which underlie ail great ques-
tions of general interest and to have such
depth and breadth of mind as to be able
to  interpret   them  without   prejudice  or
partiality.     Such   a   man   will   make   a
statement of facts only when he has the
 fullest knowledge  of the  truth of  them.
   The   first   day  of   January   there   was
 organized   in   Knoxville   an   Equal   Suff-
rage League the object of which is: &quot;to
 advance the educational, industrial, legal
 and   political   rights   of   women   and   to
 secure  suffrage  to  them  by  appropriate
 state and national legislation.
     The  membership is composed  of men
and women, about forty in number.    The
object is not selfish nor is there any desire to assert one sex against the other.
Our belief is that the infranchisement of
women   will  contribute  as  much   to   the
betterment  of   men   and   children   as   to
the  women   and  that the  home  will  be
made a better,  purer,  happier place for
the family and that the influence of this
 better family  life will  radiate and  help
 to clear that &quot;dirty pool of politics&quot; one
hears  spoken of so often.     Do you  ask
upon what  the  opinion   is   based?     The
reply is upon principles and upon facts.
As to the principle I refer you  to Benjamin   Franklin:—&quot;They   who   have   no
voice nor vote in the  electing  of representatives do  not enjoy liberty,  but are
absolutely   enslaved   to   those   who have
votes and to their representatives for to
be enslaved is  to have governors  whom
other met)  have set over us and  to   be
subject to laws made by the representatives of others without having had representatives of our own to give consent
in our behalf.&quot;
Those who are slaves can never develop into as great characters as those
who are free, hence all children, both
girls and boys, would be benefited if
their mothers were free and independent
both financially and politically.
The fact plain to all who read history
and study human conditions that laws
and customs favorable to women are
the last to be changed as civilization advances because women do not look after
these matters themselves. Some have
been too poor, weak and ignorant to demand improved conditions, while others
have been basking in the lap of luxury
protected and cared for by male relatives
and have been heedless and indifferent to
any higher life.
In conclusion, will you consent to give
a public address in Knoxville setting
forth more fully your views concerning
the advisability of demanding the financial dependence of women upon men and
the continuance of woman's political
slavery.
Waiting your  reply,   I   remain.
Your humble servant,
L.  CROZIER  FRENCH.
President Equal Suffrage League.</dc:description>

<dc:description>IS MORE BLARNEY DESIRED?
It is difficult for the mere male to grasp the rea-
soning advanced by some of the suffrage leaders
who are urging their cohorts to vote the Democratic 
ticket. The problem becomes more disturbing after
reading Mr. Henning's summary of the mental acrobatics indulged in by the administration since March
3, 1913, when the Democracy was ushered into
Washington with a suffrage parade.
It seems that soon after the parade three successive deputations, calling at the White House to
learn when the Anthony amendment would be approved by the new president, were told the tariff
was the supreme issue and must be disposed of.
When the tariff act was passed, in November, callers
were told evasively that suffrage would be given
&quot;earnest consideration.&quot;   The result of earnest 
consideration was to announce that as the Baltimore
platform did not commit him, Mr. Wilson could not
urge suffrage, 
In February, 1914, the Democratic house refused
to name a special committee. The next month
twenty-two Democrats in the senate voted against
the amendment, which needed only eleven of these
votes to pass. In June, when the president signally
abandoned the Baltimore platform in the canal tolls
matter, the women visited him again to learn why
he could not abandon it in favor of suffrage, too.
Mr. Wilson &quot;refused to be cross examined.&quot;
In January, 1915, the question came to vote in
the house, and of 282 Democrats only eighty-six
voted for suffrage.
St. Louis platform insists on a vote by states instead of federal amendment. The plea is particularly mournful in that Mr. Wilson is the man who
wrote that St. Louis platform and jammed it down
the throat of his party.
The suffrage leaders were lulled to mistaken confidence in 1918 and 1914 by pleasant words, which
have invariably been followed by hostile deeds on
the part of a Democratic president, a Democratic
senate, and a Democratic house. Can it be that
they will continue to credit promises from men who
have invariably broken past promises? Mr.  Hughes
favors the amendment and has firmly said so.
   There is not one comprehensible  reason why a
single suffrage vote should go to the Democratic
 party. </dc:description>

<dc:description>&quot;The hand that rocks the cradle rules
the world.&quot; I will cast my vote for the
hand that rocks the cradle&quot;, said Senator Gault, when the women's suffrage
amendment was under discussion in the
Nevada legislature. This amendment,
by the way, passed the senate by a
splendid majority, and will be submitted
to the voters  at the next election.
Pledge of Women Who Co-operate.
&quot;We pledge ourselves to use our united
strength   to   make   better   homes,   better
schools,      better     surroundings.      better
scholarships,   and better  lives;  to  work
together for civic health and civic righteousness;  to  preserve  our  heritage   the
forests  and  the natural  beauties of  the
land: to procure for our children  an  education that fits them for the training of
the   heart   and   hands   as   well   as the
head;   to  protect   the   children,   not   our
own,   who  are deprived  of  the privilege,
of   natural   childhood;   to   obtain    right
conditions and    proper    safeguards    for
women  who  toil.&quot;     That  they may  ac-
complish  those  things    is     why  women (missing)

<dc:description>Women in general have a deeper
and more abiding interest in children
than men have. This is necessarily
true because mothers are more closely
associated with their children than
fathers are. In fact, in many homes
the training of the children is left
practically in the hands of the moth-
er. It follows that women know more
of the disposition of children, their
wishes and their needs than men can
possibly know.
At present in the state of Tennessee
women not being qualified voters are
debarred from positions on the boards
of education. Had women positions on
these boards, the children of Tennessee would fare better than they now
do in many places
Professional politicians are said to
have declared that a school board
composed of men is much more easily
managed than one consisting of both
men and women. In the latter case,
each acts as a check upon the other.
If women were qualified voters
they could serve on boards of education and vote on all school questions.
Then the great-army of women teachers who outnumber the men many
times would be placed on an equal
footing with the men in their profession ,and merit alone would determine position and salary.
Surely a condition in which both
the pupils and teachers of the schools
will be benefited is a desirable one,
nay a necessary one for highest development of the schools.

<dc:description>Woman Suffrage Act.
By  JOSEPH  H.  ACKLEN.
In compliance with your request for
an opinion on chapter 139, &quot;the &quot;woman
 suffrage&quot;   act,   I   beg   to   say:
I heard the discussion in the. senate.
 When the bill was read I remarked to
the gentleman next to me, Mr. Thomas
jB. Johnson, that the measure was un-
constitutional.      Careful     examination
 of  this  act  confirms the  opinion   then
expressed.
There are at least two very serious
 defects   in   the   act—the   poll   tax   and
 the   ballot—and   possibly   a   third.
Poll tax is a constitutional  tax, imposed to raise revenue for educational
 purposes.     Section   28,   article 2,   pro-
vides, &quot;All male citizens of this state
over the age of twenty-one years, ex
cept such persons as may be exempted
by law on account of age or other in-
firmity, shall be liable to a poll tax
of not less than fifty cents nor more
than one dollar per annum; nor shall
any county or corporation levy a poll
tax exceeding the amount levied by
the   state.&quot; 
Section I, of article 4, provides:
&quot;There shall be no qualification attached to the right of suffrage, except
that each voter shall give to the
judges of election, where he offers to
vote, satisfactory evidence that he has
paid the poll taxes assessed against
him for such preceding period as the
legislature shall prescribe, and at such
times as may be prescribed by law;
without which his vote cannot be received. And all male citizens of the
state shall be subject to payment of
poll taxes and to the performance of
military duty within such ages as may
be  prescribed by law.&quot;
Section  12, article 11 provides:   &quot;The
state taxes derived hereafter from
polls shall be appropriated to educational purposes, in such manner as the
general assembly shall from time to
time direct by law.&quot;
For poll tax and voting, see the following cases: Ballentine vs. Pulaski,
15, Lea 633; Jackson vs. State, 17 Pick.,
138; Kuntz vs. Davidson County, 6 Lea,
65; Lynn vs. Polk, 8, Lea 132; State vs.
Old, 11, Pick., 723; State Vs. Weaver,
14, Cates, 198; Ledgerwood vs. Pitts,
14   Cates, 198.
Section 3 of the act in question:
&quot;That where satisfactory evidence of
the payment of poll taxes assessed
against them for a certain period is
required to be furnished at such election by male voters, women who are
entitled to vote under the preceding
sections of this act in elections for
electors of President and Vice-President of the United States shall likewise furnish evidence of the payment
of poll taxes assessed against them
in the same manner required by law
of   other   voters.&quot;
Actual payment of poll tax does not
protect the voter who fails to produce the statutory proof of payment;
i. e., the satisfactory evidence of payment  required.   State  vs.   Old,  II  Pick., 723.
Omitting       the     words
assessed against them, the provision of section 3 means: Women must produce the evidence of payment of poll taxes required of men as a prerequisite of voting.  The legislature has no constitutional authoirityto assess a poll tax against women, therefore the words &quot;assessed against them&quot; are superfluous.
Should it be insisted that the legislature
 intended to confer upon women 
the right to vote without requiring
satisfactory evidence of payment
of poll taxes while such a requirement
is exacted from men then that
would   be   class   legislation.
The logical conclusion from the lan-
guage employed in section 3 is: That
women were put (in the elections
mentioned) on the same footing as
men.
No poll tax is sought to be im-
posed upon them as upon men. Nor
could there be under the constitu-
tion. Therefore, the requirement that
they produce satisfactory evidence of
its payment as a prerequisite to vot-
ing makes it in effect a privilege tax.
This the legislature cannot impose as
voting is not an avocation.
It may be further noted that Sec-
tion 3 refers only to &quot;elections for
electors of President and Vlce-Presi-
dent of the United States,&quot; and is si-
lent as to other elections &quot;for all officers, of cities, towns and taxing districts and upon all questions or propositions submitted exclusively to the
vote of the electors of such municipal-
ties&quot;   set   out   in   section   1.
The ballot presents a no less serious
difficulty. Under our election law
names of all candidates appear upon
one ballot, and there is no provision
made for a separate box.
The following illustration will explain this: Given a precinct where one
thousand ballots are cast, the clerks
poll lists showing five hundred men
and five hundred women to have voted.
The count, however, discloses the fact
that some eight or nine hundred ballots have been Voted for others than
the presidential electors. Here, then,
is a situation where the entire vote of
that precinct, in other than the presidential race, must be thrown out. This
might result in reversing the real voice
of the people. 
The legislature has authorized numerous bond issues to be determined
by local elections. Until the &quot;woman
suffrage&quot; act is passed upon by the
courts, women voting in these elections may cause the validity of the
bond issue to be questioned, and thus
affect  the sale  of  the  bonds.
It is regrettable that this situation
has arisen. The public interest de-
mands that it be settled by our Supreme Court at the earliest possible
date.
The Republican party, now in control
of congress, will pass the Susan B.
Anthony amendment, thereby seeking
to make political capital for 1920. But
as only state  legislatures that shall
have been elected subsequent to such
passage can act upon the amendment,
some time may yet elapse before it becomes a part of the Federal constitu-
tion.
This reply to your inquiry is not a
court brief but merely a very &quot;brief
opinion.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Some Evils (?) of Equal Suffrage
By MRS. JULIA A. LUCKY.
Why is it that every great movement in the world's history is met with looks askance and the condemning voice because of the evils that may follow, as evils that inevitably will follow according to these gloomy prophets?  These ravens have given us suffragists various terrible forecasts: &quot;Woman suffrage will unsex women;&quot; &quot;It will increase divorce;&quot; &quot;it will break up the home;&quot; &quot;men will cease to love us;&quot;  &quot;it will cause race suicide;&quot;  &quot;it will increase corruption;&quot; &quot;it will create sex antagonism;&quot;  &quot;it will place an intolerable burden on women;&quot; &quot;it will destroy chivalry;&quot; &quot;undesirable women will constitute the larger portion of the voters,&quot; and so on ad nauseum. Now these objections put forth by the antis and by them styled reasons have been answered time and again and most effectually.  I will deal with only one and that the last: &quot;Undesirable women chiefly will vote.&quot; Who are these undesirable women? Hitherto we have thought of them as the women of the streets whose steps lead down to hell: women in the houses of prostitution whose trade enslaves our girls and debauches our men.  Why should, by the way, why should (sic.) the women of the underworld care to vote? In Denver they did not when the  _____ police attempted to compel them to register and vote, they appealed for protection to a woman's political club.  So if they do use the ballot who takes them to the polls?  Is it men or women that are guilty?  But of late to the list of undesirables has been added another class,  that of the negro women.  At the ballot box we may have to rub elbows with cook and maid, yet we suffragists might prefer even that to being classed with idiots, criminals and insane.  Every politcal and sociological problem  has some hard and unpleasant side lights and extension of the franchise to negroes has been one of these.  Many people thinking of this sincerely believe that the privilege of suffrage has been already too widely and indiscriminately conferred.  But why, in a sudden spasm of virtue, draw the line at women?  Why make us responsible for, or at least the innocent sufferers  from masculine bad judgment?  Of course, the negro problem in the south greatly complicates the questions of votes for women, and as one of our brilliant woman writers of Tennessee says: &quot;Eastern and western people cannot realize how grave and serious the problem.&quot;  This same sparkling editress, for she is an editess,  and thus has a far-reaching outlook, says further: &quot;It is not for these eastern and western women to come into the southland and cry, 'rights, give us rights.'  How is it that no leader of the suffrage movement (she says &quot;suffragette&quot; but we hate the word) has hailed from the south?  Now, it is deadful(sic.) to catch an editress napping, but has this one forgotten the Misses Gordon of New Orleans, Mary Johnson, Ellen Galsgow, Miss Clay of Kentucky, Mrs. Desha Breckenridge, a niece we believe of Henry Clay, and our own lovely Miss Elliott? Besides these eastern and western, are right smart folks, and if they have helped waken us out of the lethargy of a fatal trust in mere southern chivalry, or indifference, or that conservatism, the seeping sickness of the soul, then we give them thanks.  We need guides through the wilderness of our wrongs and the clearing thereof, they have blazed the way let us gladly follow.  When it comes to a question of locality we would have our editress remember that the birthplace of freedom for man in this country was in the east, though the Middle and Southern states gallantly fell in line. No, there must be no sectionalism in equal sufffrage. A women, heart to heart, mind to mind, shoulder to shoulder, we must make the fight and unselfish union will be our strongest weapon.  Now, &quot;revenous nous moutons:&quot; Which in this is the African women in America.  It is important not only for their social racial integrity but for their physical well being that the white and the black races should be kept separate, and over that line none should ever step.  But since the law has given the franchise to negro men, equal suffrage must confer it to negro women.   The problems will then be similar and the wisdom that strives to handle  the one may be brought to bear on the other.  Men have so often told us that good women outnumber the bad that we ourselves believe it and will hope it to prove equally true in the negro women. Could we by some skill in politcal alchemy reach and make use of only the pure gold, rejecting the baser metals, could we sift out the ignorant, the vicious, the corrupt voters, leaving only the honest and high minded, then indeed we would reach the perfection of government.  Since we cannot, then it is right and wise for men and women to solve these questions together, using each his or her own peculiar strength, power, and intelligence.  Our own Miss Elliott, and we love to call her so, says &quot;this question of the negro is irrelevant, extraneous, and has nothing to do with the issue.&quot;  We women are planning and striving for just one thing, the right to do our duty as citizens.  After that privilege is ours then it will be time to consider the lions in the path.

<dc:description>Equal Suffrage association and Knoxville Equal Suffrage league.
Being 21 years old, we object to being
classed with  minors.
Born in America, and loyal to her
institutions, we protest against being
made perpetual aliens.
Costing the treasuries of our counties
nothing, we protest against acknowledging the male pauper as our political superior.
Being obedient to the law. we protest
against the statute which classes us
with the convict, and makes the pardoned criminal our political superior.
Being sane, we object to being classed
with  the  lunatic.
Possessed of an average amount of
intelligence, we protest against legal
classification  with the  idiot.
We taxpayers claim the right to representation.   
We married women want to own our
own  clothes.
We married breadwinners want to own
our own earnings.    We mothers want an equal partnership
 in our children.
We educated women want the power
 to offset the illiterate vote of our state.
 Women who object to being thus
classed, and men who object to thus
classing mothers, sisters, wives and
daughters, are urged to join the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league and help to
obtain a higher classification.</dc:description>

following letter received by the editor
of the woman's page from Mrs. George
Randolph in regard to woman's suffrage.
 &quot;A republican form of government is
lasting and stable only so long as the
majority of votes cast are honest votes.
The many political scandals unearthed
in recent years prove that the number of
bought or controlled votes has steadily
increased since the early days of the republic.
&quot;The votes of women are opposed
among others by the liquor interests, by
the 'big business' manufacturers who
now weave the souls of women and chil-
dren into costly fabrics, and by all who
exploit women and babies. The reason
for their opposition is that they fear the
stand women will take when they or-
ganize, and vote, and that only by their
united action can the opinions of women
 crystalize  into  power.
&quot;Few women who have the mother in-
stinct would cast a vote other than for
what they believe to be for the best in-
terest of their children and fireside. Suf-
frage would mean clean and unpurchas-
able votes and our government needs a[ll]
such.
&quot;The woman movement at work as

<dc:description>VICTORY   FOR   SUFFRAGE.
Special to The Knoxville Sentinel
WASHINGTON,      April    4.  — Having
obtained   a   majority   vote   in   the   senate
in   favor   of  the   amendment   for   woman
suffrage,  the  congressional committee   of
the national association feel that a great
victory was achieved recently when
the vote was taken. Although there wa
some controversy as to whether the vote
should   have  been postponed,    it  is  prob-
able that a postponement would have
lost instead of gained votes. The thirty
five who voted for the amendment are Ashurst, Arizona;  Brady, of Idaho; Bris-
tow, Kansas; Burton, Ohio; Chamber-
lain, Oregon; Clapt,. Minnesota; Clark, 
Wyoming; Galliinger, New Hampshire;
Gronna, North Dakota; Hollis, New
Hampshire;   Hughes,   New   Jersey;   Jones,</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE
IN UNITED STATES
Question Attracting Wide Attention and is Being Universally Discussed.
WHERE WOMEN CAN VOTE
Opinion of Eminent Men on
the Subject Proves
Interesting.
(By Laura M. Thornburgh.)
There is probably no question receiving more universal attention at the
present moment than the question of
woman suffrage and what that implies.
______ is like the Pinchot-Ballinge
affair or city elections may assume more
importance for a short space of time
but the suffrage question with arguments pro and con is one that is likely
to continue indefinitely or until it is
satisfactorily settled to those most concerned.
One can hardly pick up a newspaper
or a current magazine without finding
some article bearing on the question.
Leading and representative statesmen,
public officials, literati and professional men have been interviewed and
their opinions printed. It is an interesting fact that most of the opinions
publicly expressed are decidedly in favor of the movement. Those who have
given the matter thought seem to realize that equal suffrage not only will
come to those who want it, but is already here, and it is only a question ot
time when it will be universal in this
country.
The question has come to be, &quot;Will
it be best for all concerned that women
be given the ballot?&quot; for the question,
&quot;Is it right that women have the power
of the ballot?&quot; has been answered in
the affirmative. There are no sane arguments that intelligent women should be
discriminated against when the illiterate
negro has a right to say what shall be
done in municipal affairs. It also seems
absurd to think that a young boy just
twenty-one years of age can go out
and vote on matters of public welfare
when the school teacher who has taught
him all he knows about political economy
shall be denied a voice in the matter.
It is interesting to read the sentiments of public men from the states
where women's suffrage is now allowed.
The general feeling is decidedly favorable. Those who object are almost entirely the party bosses and  professional
politicians whom the women have defeated.
Women Vote In  Municipal Affairs.
The   city   government   is   now   elected
by   men   and   women   together   in   every
city  of England,   Scotland,   Ireland,   Aus-
tralia,    New    Zealand,    Norway,    Sweden
and   Denmark.     In   this   country   women
have    the   rights    of   equal    suffrage    in
Idaho,   Wyoming,   Utah  and  Colorado.
Opinions  of   Public   Men.
 In    speaking   on      woman's      suffrage,
United States   Senator   Borah,   of  Idaho,
savs:      &quot;I would be entirely unwilling to see woman's suffrage abolished.&quot;  United States Senator Heyburn, of Idaho, says: The   general  tone
of   political
affairs in  the   stale   have   
improved   and
greater   care   in   the   selection
of  candi-
dates   has   resulted.     Between
 sixty   and
seventy   per   cent   of   the   
women   vote.&quot;
On   the   same   subject   present
 Governor
Brady   says:     ''Woman's   
suffrage   is   an
unqualified   success   not   only
  in   Idaho
but  in  all  of   the   western
states   adopt-
ing    the   principle.      I    am
heartily    in
favor   of   its   wide   expansion.&quot;
Former
Governor   Steunenberg   says
&quot;In   Idaho
women are  today the same
loving wives,
kind   mothers- and   capable
home   man-
agers   they   have   always   been,    nor   has
there   been    the   least   belittling   of   the
sex  in  the  eyes  of the  men.&quot;
 The    same    sentiments   are   voiced    by
 the men of Utah and Wyoming and Colorado.     Former    United   States    Senator
 Sutherland,   of   Utah,    says:      &quot;Woman's
 suffrage   has   raided   the   whole   tone  of
politics.&quot;      Governor    Brooks,    of   Wyoming,   says:     &quot;I   consider   woman's   suffrage   of   great  benefit   to  any   commonwealth.      There   is   no   argument   which
can be made against it.&quot;    Judge Lindsey,
of  Colorado,   says  that   he  owes  his  last
election   largely   to   the   influence   of   the
women and to their votes.
Many of these testimonials come un-
solicited. It has been said that the
men desiring the women's votes speak
favorably of woman's suffrage for political reasons, but in that case the endorsement need not be so unqualified
and   universal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Contract   in   Louisiana. 
 A   strong   article   on   this   subject   
recently came  out  in Hampton's Magazine
 entitled,    &quot;What    Eight   Million   Women
Want.&quot;      Colorado   is   called    &quot;Woman's
Paradise,&quot;   and   Louisiana,   is   contrasted
 with it.    &quot;In Louisiana,&quot; says the article,
&quot;your   disabilities   actually   begin   when
 you become an engaged girl. [From that]
happy   moment   on,   you   are   under   the
dominance    of    a    man.      Your   wedding 
presents   are   not   yours,   but   his.     Your
clothing, your dowry becomes community
property  as  soon  as  the  marriage   cere-
mony   is   over   and   community   property
 in   Louisiana   is   controlled  absolutely  by 
lthe husband.    During the husband's life-
time  he   is   sole  guardian   of  their   chil-
dren.     At   his   death   she   may   become 
their guardian,  but if she marries again
and   the   law   permits   her   to   remarry
provided  she  waits  ten  months,   she  re-____________ her   children   only  by   formal   con-
sent   of   her   first   husband's   family.     
If they   dislike   her   or   disapprove   of   the
second  marriage,   they   may   demand   the
custody   of   the   children.     In   only   ten
states    are    women      co-guardians    with
their  husbands   of  their children.&quot;
 Conditions   In   Colorado.
     Miss Jane Addams has declared  (after
close study of the subject)   that   the laws
in Colorado are superior
in reegards
to women and children than of any
other state. Women in Colorado receive
equal pay for equal work, they are 
guardians of the children and the edu-
cation of the children is placed almost
entirely in their hands. </dc:description>

<dc:description>Good Blood
Means good health, and Hood's
Sarsaparilla has an unapproached
record as a blood-purifier.
It effects its wonderful cures, not
simply because it contains sarsaparilla
but because it combines the utmost
remedial values of more than 20 different
ingredients. There is no real substitute
for it. If urged to buy any preparation
said to be &quot;just as good&quot; you may be
sure it is inferior, costs less to make,
and yields the dealer a larger profit.
Get Hood's Sarsaparilla today.   In usual liquid form or in chocloated tablets known as Sarsatabs.

Mrs.   Edward   Hardin   and   family   have
recently  come  to  this place,   where  they

<dc:description>THE NATIONAL
WOMAN'S PARTY
Several months after the inauguration
of President Wilson there was organized
in Washington city, &quot;The Congressional
Union,&quot; by Misses Paul and Burns. The
object of this union was to procure the
passage of an amendment to the federal
constitution looking to the enfranchisement of all citizens of the United States
regardless of sex. These young women
and many beside recognized that by
state enactment alone the women of the
whole United States would not be allowed to vote for a hundred years or
more. They therefore determined to besiege the national fortress which was
controlled iby the democratic party as to
 the executive as well as both houses of
congress. The siege continued during
the first term of President Wilson's administration, the besiegers being forced
Ito the conclusion that the executive alone
was responsible for the refusal of the
fortress to surrender.  The Congressional Union sent out a
call to the women of the west who had
votes to come to the aid  their eastern
 and southern sisters.
This call met with a generous response
 and a woman's party was organized by
the women voters to work in unison with the Congressional Union for the passage of the federal amendment.  Less than a year has passed but the wisdom of the organization of the woman's party has become so evident that it was decided to merge the Congression___ __________________ it, which was done during ___________________ of both in Washington _________________________________  March.
You surely will feel ashamed to accept your freedom at the hands of women to whom you have given no help at all.  As state chairman it is my duty to appoint a chariman of each congressinal district, who will help me do this by sending in the names of those women who will make good chairmen? It will then be the duty of each congressional chairman to appoint a chairman of each county in her district.  Will not those who read this help along the good work by sending in names of a number of women at each county seat who would make good helpers in the cause? Act quickly, lest the cause be gained before you have a chance to lend a helping hand. 
Miss Carrie Callaway is the secretary
and treasurer for the state committee,
she will be most happy to receive any
donation you would be pleased to send.
We desire to open headquarters at
Knoxville, help to this end will be most
gladly received. </dc:description>

JANE ADDAMS ON
CHICAGO'S CHANGE
Shows   immediate    Results      of    Vote
in      Garbage      and      Police-Women   Reforms
Jane Addams was one of the speakers at a luncheon recently given in
 Washington by the National College
 Equal Suffrage league. She said that
 the women of Illinois had found their
influence much increased since they
 got the ballot. Illustrating this, Miss
 Addams continued:
&quot;Miss Mary McDowell had been
 greatly interested in the garbage ques-
tion for many years, because the big-
gest garbage dump in Chicago is in
her ward, and the garbage has simply
been put there and allowed to decay.
She has interviewed all manner of
committees and officials, without re-
sult. Within two weeks after the wo-
man suffrage law went into effect,
 Miss McDowell was appointed a
member of a garbage committee, made
up mostly of aldermen, with one or two physicians—a committee with
 $10,000 to spend. In all likelihood this
would not have happened but for wo-
man suffrage.
   &quot;We had been trying    for      a    long
 time,   without   success,   to   secure   the
appointment   of     police-women.       We
wanted   them   especially  to  look  after
girls  at dance    halls      and    in    other
places  of public recreation. After wo-
man  suffrage was granted ten police-
women   were  appointed  very   quickly
 with  full police powers.
     &quot;Judge   Owens,   who   makes  the   ar-
rangements for the city elections, has
 issued  an   order   asking for   1,400  women
  volunteers   to  serve  as       judges
and  clerks of election in    every    pre-
cinct.  The pay is $5 per day, and the
work will cover about 20  days  In the
 course   of   a  year,   including  the    va-
rious elections, and the    time    needed
for counting the ballots. Judge Owens
is establishing so    many      precedents
 that   I   think  the  opponents  of   equal
rights  will  never  be   able  to  get   the
 women  out.
&quot;Our experience    in    Illinois    has
thoroughly exploded the idea that wo-
men  have more  respect and influence
 without   a   vote.     Every   woman   who
 has  been  to the  city hall  or  has  had
 anything to do with city officials has
 observed a very    striking    change    in
 their  demeanor since the woman suf-
frage  bill   passed.    They    are      much more  respectful  and  gallant.
'Miss   Harriet   Vittum,   president   of
Women's City club,  has been try-
ing to get an ordinance for the better
ventilation  of the   five-cent     theatres,
and so she has  had to go to the city
hall a great deal,  and to see    various
committees.  She says that &quot;before woman  suffrage  they   were    polite     (of
course,   they  are  too   good  politicians
to be otherwise), but that since then
they have been cordial, and are ab-
solutely tumbling over themselves to
meet the wishes of the women.&quot;
SOUTHERN WOMAN
EXONERATES   PAUL
Asks  Why     Literal     Application
Teachings  is      Confined    to    Single
Point
In the Atlanta Constitution Mrs. J.
K. Ottley reviews with much force
the anti-suffrage argument lately put
forth by a Savannah judge, who based it largely on Paul. Mrs. Ottley asks
why we should insist upon a literal
application to our day of Paul's rules
for the Corinthians on this one question, when we have ceased to do it on
so many others. Thus Paul devotes
thirteen verses to the impropriety of
a woman's &quot;praying unto God with
uncovered head,&quot; yet in a crowded,
modern church women are often ask-
ed to remove their picture hats for
the greatest good of the greatest number. Mrs. Ottley gives other instances
and  says:
&quot;It seems to me a little hard on
Paul, who gave us some of our most
wonderful messages of great abiding
spiritual truth, that he should be so
constantly brought forward and quoted, not for his great essential inspiration, but in the light of some detailed
instructions which he gave to the
near-Pagan Corinthians 2,000 years
ago. We do not observe these Corinthian  rules,  as  indeed      why     should we?&quot;
WANTED   A   VOTE.
A prize was lately won by the following limerick, written by Mrs.
John B. Parker, a member of the
Era club of New Orleans:
There once was a woman of note
Who  very much wanted to vote;
Her  neighbors   said  &quot;Here,
You stay in your sphere;
Go home and have babies to tote!&quot;
She then formed   a club literary,
Which  studied  child-life,   civics      and
dairy;
They found out their right
To make the world  bright,
and decent, and home-like and cheery.
They studied of home and the nation,
And learned to each the relation,
&quot;We'll  have  better laws,&quot;
Said these women,  &quot;because
We'll  work  for  our country's  salvation.&quot;
And now in ten states women vote
On  questions both  near and remote;
&quot;Our banner's unfurled
And our sphere is the word,&quot;
Says this  wonderful  woman  of note.</dc:description>

...of happiness is curtailed by the lack of the ballet.  Much of the happiness of life comes from the ability to do or help to do large things that are worthwhile, and that are a blessing to other family circles as well as my own.    &quot;No man liveth unto himself,&quot; and no family can live unto itself.  The interest of all are so inseparably united  that  no woman can do her full duty inside the four walls of her own home.  She sums up her argument by giving the following concise reasons  for the ballot:  I want to vote because (a) Intelligence is a prime qualification for voting, and it is conceded that the general average of intelligence is as good among women as among men.
(b)     1  have to  obey  the  laws,  and
therefore want to help make them.
	
(c)     I pay taxes.

(d)     I am as much  interested and
concerned  in   the  things  voted   on  as
men  are.
(e)     Disenfranchisement is a    badge
of  inferiority   and   contempt.
&quot;in     order
(f)     I am more capable of casting
an intelligent ballot than thousands of
men are.
Hurrah   for

<dc:description>Difference of Opinion in Securing Suffrage.   Mrs. Funk and Mrs. Seton Express Opposite  Views at
Mass Meeting.
LOCAL WOMEN'S WELCOME
Suffrage    Leaders    Present
Reasons    Why    Women
Should be Given Vote.
Lateness  of  the  hour prevented  an
interesting  discussion    between    Mrs.
Antoinette    Funk,    of   Chicago,    vice-
chairman of the congressional committee of the national woman's    suffrage
association,   and  Mrs.    Seton,  of  Connecticut,   vice-president   of   the   Connecticut  state league  and also  chairman of the national program commit-
tee,  at the conclusion of Mrs. Funk's 
address before the opening session of
the convention of the Tennessee Equal
Suffrage association Wednesday night.
Whether public    opinion    has    weight
with  legislators,   was  the  question  at
issue.
Mrs. Funk explained a resolution
which had been prepared to put before
congress which would provide for an
amendment to the United States constitution, giving women a sweeping
privilege to vote. All this could be
accomplished, she maintained, at one
stroke, with not more preliminary
work than it would take to get the
states lined up by means of public
opinion in favor of suffrage. Understanding Mrs. Seton's difference of
view on this particular phase of proposed legislation to enfranchise women, Mrs. Funk invited that lady to
express her opinion on the subject.
Mrs.  Seton  arose  and    stated    that
she differed with Mrs. Funk and while
differing she  represented a faction in 
favor  of  moulding   public   opinion   in 
favor of passing the old Susan B. An- 
thony resolution which would give the
women a vote.    Her principal point of
difference,  she stated,    was that    she
saw   insurmountable   obstacles  in   the 
way of inducing the national legislators to pass such a resolution as Mrs. 
Funk    had    detailed,    without getting
the support and moral maintenance of
the legislators' constituents.
Mrs. Funk asked Mrs. Seton to outline in detail her objections to the
plan that has been agreed on by the
national congressional committee, but
Mrs. Seton declined to speak further
owing to the lateness of the hour and
her unpreparedness. &quot;I feel that I
could debate the question, however,&quot;
said she. &quot;But I hardly think this the
proper time to begin what might take
hours,&quot;
It was then past 10 o'clock.
Market hall was comfortably filled
with an audience comprised mainly of 
women at the opening session of the 
convention of the Tennessee Equal
Suffrage association Wednesday night.
About thirty-five delegates were in attendance.
The principal address of the evening
was delivered by Mrs. Antoinette Funk
of Chicago, vice-chairman of the national congressional committee of the
National American Woman's Suffrage
association.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president
of the Tennessee association, presided.
She outlined briefly the history of the
woman suffrage movement in the
United States, and defined the factions, or parties, of suffrage as they
stand today. She also gave a history
of woman suffrage in Tennessee, summing up the results of work begun in
1909. The Knoxville Equal Suffrage
league  she  stated,   was   organized   in
1910, when there was only one other
league in the state. Since that time
leagues have been organized in other
principal cities of the state.
Addresses of Welcome.
Miss Ada Fanz, vice-president of the
Knoxville Equal Suffrage league, delivered a brief address in which she
welcomed the delegates and visitors in
the name of the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league. Mrs. R. L. Cunningham,
president of the Women's council, of
Knoxville, welcomed the convention on
behalf of the Knoxville women's clubs.
In an address Mrs. Geo. W. Denney,
president of the state federation oi
women's clubs, welcomed the delegates
and the convention on behalf of her
organization.
Mrs. George Baxter, state regent, of
Tennessee chapters, Daughters of the
American Revolution, also extended a
welcome and greeting. </dc:description>

<dc:description>Mr. T A. Wright, vice-president of
the Knoxville Board of Commerce, was
invited to deliver an address of welcome on the part of Knoxville voters,
but was called away from the city.
However, he wrote a letter to Mrs.
French, which was read, in which he
welcomed the convention through the
medium of writing.
Judge Henry R. Gibson was intro-
duced as being the first Knoxville
voter to advocate woman suffrage
openly. He referred to an editorial
which he had written thirty years ago
advocating women's rights, when he
was editor of a Knoxville daily paper.
Response to the hearty welcome and
greetings was made by Miss Ernestine
Noa, of Chattanooga. Miss Noa's response was one of the features of the
evening. In eloquent language, she acknowledged the hearty welcome that
has always been accorded in Knoxville.
Mrs. Seaton, of Connecticut, vice-
president of the Connecticut state
league and also chairman of the national program committee, was introduced and called upon for an address.
Mrs. Seaton was given an ovation. She
is regarded as one of the movement's
most gifted and talented women, and
is in high demand all over the country
at conventions. She told of having
seen the results of woman suffrage in 
California, where she spent part of the
past summer. She stated that the city
of Los Angeles had been cleaned up by
the citizens since the advent of woman
suffrage in that state.  &quot;Los Angeles,&quot;  she said, &quot;has been called the only chemically pure city on the whole country.&quot;
   She explained the efforts of 
[suf]fragists   in  Connecticut  where
[cond]tions are different from those in
most states.
 Woman's Vote Helps Home.
&quot;We agree that the woman's place is
in the   home,&quot;   said    Mrs.   Antoinette 
Funk, of Chicago, who was introduced 
as  the  last  and  principal  speaker  of 
the session.    &quot;I hope that it shall ever 
be.    But the time has come when the
woman must    protect her    home, she
must maintain the old home influences
by taking a hand in the government of
the states and nation.   She must vote.
&quot;Some people argue against woman
suffrage the proposition that voting
would keep woman away from her
home and children. It took me just
eighteen minutes to go from my home
to the polls, cast my vote, and return.&quot;
Mrs. Funk declared that the talk of
women being polluted by voting was
bosh and nonsense. She said that if
the polling places are so filthy and
dirty, it is high time for the women to
take a hand and clean up their morals.
She replied to other such arguments
against woman suffrage which she
branded as absurd. The health of the
home would be benefited, she stated,
by the women taking a hand in politics. Conditions, she averred, which
now exist as a result of corrupt politics would be banished, and the sanitation of cities would be much improved by the women who are cleanly
by nature. In this connection she said
impure foods are manufactured and
sold broadcast.
Coming to the much desired aim of
all suffragists, .the vote, Mrs. Funk
stated that the time has come when
suffrage advocates do not have to
argue the ethics of the question, but
how will the vote be gotten.
The principal barriers to obtaining
legislation in favor of woman suffrage
in the states, she maintained, are the
constitutions of the states themselves.
She said that if a national amendment
could be secured, enfranchising women
it would take twenty-five years for the
states separately to change their constitutions so as to allow woman suffrage. She gave several examples of
this, illustrating by the example of
New Mexico and Illinois.
Following Mrs. Funk's address, a
collection was taken, for the purpose
of defraying the expenses of the convention. Then the speakers mixed
with the audience, and Knoxville women were given a chance to meet personally suffrage celebrities.
Says the Omaha Daily News-- &quot;Rarely has the lash of the &quot;Interest&quot; been swung more effectively over the backs of the representatives of the people of the state, than was the case last week in the Nebraska legislature when telegrams and telephone calls poured in on representatives demanding that they vote against equal suffrage.  The result was defeat, by vote of 50 to 49.  However the Nebraska suffragists will also appeal to the initiative, and are already preparing their petitions.                                                                        The Missouri suffragists were disappointed but not surprised last week, when their amendment was referred to committee through the pressure brought to bear upon the various senators by the liquor men, who fear that the State will go &quot;dry&quot; if women are allowed to vote.  In case the legislature also refuses to submit the measure, the women will invoke the initiativem feeling confident that they can secure the requisite number of names to their petitions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>PROHIBITION AND
EQUAL SUFFRAGE  Go Hand In Hand and Will Soon be Nation-Wide.   Is Prediction of Dr.  Maynard.
Eugenics  Specialist-De-
clares South Is Too Conservative.
&quot;It is my firm belief,&quot; said Dr. Newell C. Maynard, lecturer, traveler, and student of sociology, psychology, and eugenics, heard in three lectures here this week &quot;that by the year 1920, the liquor traffic will have been destroyed in the United States and woman suffrage will have become nation-wide.&quot;  &quot;These two reforms go hand in hand,&quot; continued Dr. Maynard, in an interview with a Journal and Tribune representative.  &quot;The one embraces the other, and both are good and tend toward the betterment of the race.  I have traveled recently in most of the states of the union that have enfranchised their women and I find that, without exception, the reform has proven all that was claimed for it by its most ardent supporters.&quot;  Dr. Maynard has been in Knoxville delivering a series of three lectures on eugenics under the auspices of Ossoli circle.  He came as a representative of the National Society for Broader Education, which was organized four years ago in New York by thirty college presidents for the purpose of popularizing education throughout the United States.  Dr. Maynard is an advocate of equal suffrage for the sexes and declares that &quot;all the forces which tend to degeneracy and the decadence of the race are opposed to extending the ballot to women.  &quot;What institutions, individuals and parties are inactive and organized opposition to woman suffrage,&quot; said Dr. Maynard, and in reply to his own question, said, &quot;those that derive their income, or a part of it, from the open saloon, the white slave traffic, the gambling dens, the pool rooms and other vice agencies.  The liquor interests in every state in the union are out and out against woman suffrage.&quot;             Continuing, Dr. Maynard said:---&quot;There is no use mincing words.  The English speaking races are deteriorating.  Especially is this true of the English nation, but the American nation is also at the turning point, and already going down the hill, and unless the intelligent people, the best people recognize this fact and use their intelligence and energies to counteract the tendency toward decay, this nation will go the way of all the civilizations of the past, from ancient Babylon to modern Spain.&quot;    &quot;I believe that woman suffrage is in
the direct line of evolution and progress.
It  is a great principle that is  working
itself  out,  and it  cannot be  checked.&quot;           &quot;I do  not believe the race can  ever
develop and attain its highest destiny
until the two halves of which it is com-
posed are on an absolutely equal footing.
The fact that half the race  is held
back and modified by traditions, and by
restricted and artificail environment, has
postponed and is postponing the time
when the race can really begin to de-
velop along its highest and most useful lines.  And while we are waiting for this
opportunity for free development,&quot; went
on the speaker, &quot;the race is deteriorating physically,  mentally and morally.&quot;
Should Have Fair Test.
''Those who say that women's activities and interests should be entirely
 limited to the home and its concerns are theorizing, for nothing can be disproved
 until it is tried.    Equal suffrage should
be given a fair test and then judged by
its fruits.
&quot;If   there  are  those who   can prove
 that the higher education of women has
been  harmful, let them make out their
case and we suffragists will consider it.
But   I   think  this   cannot    be   proven.
 Some generations ago, there were not a
few  'wise men'   who wrote   books  and 
tracts to prove that woman was physio- 
logically constructed so that the taking 
of  a  college  course  would   work  havoc 
with her physique.    Now, our strongest,
tallest,   most     beautifully    formed,  and
fascinating  women  are  those  who   are
college bred.    So much for the    alarm-
ists.        &quot;There are now a few who raise their voices in the market place, and are not backward in making the statement in the press that if woman be allowed to engage  in politics and other concerns formerly looked upon as the exclusive perogative of the male, she will work ruin upon herself, and drag down with her the entire nation.                               &quot;All I can say is give it a 'try out.'
Don't condemn what has not been tried.
The race is already on the decline, and
why hesitate to apply to the whole nation the remedy that has proven effica-
cious when applied to isolated sections?
But I look upon equal suffrage as more than an experiment,&quot; said Dr. Maynard.  Dr. Maynard is a young man, educated, widely traveled, and cultured in the sense that he applies his education and culture to every day life and the practical concerns of living.  He is broad in his views, open to suggestions, and a public speaker of force and interest.  His course of three lectures, given at the Lyceum building in this city, was well attended and much enjoyed.  So full is Dr. Maynard of his subject, eugenics, and the related sciences, that he can talk for hours without exhausting his fund of knowledge.  When asked his impression of the south, Mr. Maynard said, &quot;The South, like some sections of New England, is over-conservation, narrow, prejudiced, and hide-bound.  It is opposed to movements that include the spreading of a wider democracy.  Such sections are blocking progress, and standing in the way of those that would go forward.&quot; In this he said the people of this section show a close kinship with their English forefathers.  &quot;Go into the west, or middle west, and you will note the difference.&quot;  In making this statement, Dr. Maynard said that he referred broadly to the section as a whole, but that he has met, in every city of the south, men and women, individuals, who do not subscribe to these provencial tenets.  Dr. Maynard left the city Friday for Atlanta, where he will lecture before various organizations.

<dc:description>SUFFRAGISTS'
CONVENTION
Will Be Occasion of Much Activity by Women.
Social Events For Visitors Are
to Be Made Important Feature of the Gathering.

As the time for the annual meeting of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage convention draws near, interest in the event increases.
It is thought, by all in touch with the suffrage movement in this state
that the 1914 convention, to be held in this City October 28, 29 and 30, will be the most successful ever conducted in Tennessee, and a large attendance from all sections of the state is expected.
The Nashville delegation will be the largest.  It will consist of about twenty women, who will come to this city in a special Pullman.
Mrs. Guilford Dud-
ley, president of the. Nashville league
and a social leader at the Tennessee cap-
ital, will lead the delegation. Maria
Thompson Daviess, the well-known author, will also be in the party from
Nashville.
A large delegation is also expected
from Chattanooga, several will come
from Jackson, and a number from Mor-
ristown and other East Tennessee cities.
The Hotel Imperial is to be convention headquarters, and the day sessions
will be held in the convention room at
that hotel. The evening sessions will
be in  Market hall.
It was first announced that the sessions of the convention would he held
In the Lyceum building, but it has been
decided that the assembly room of the
Woman's building is too small.
The morning sessions will be devoted
to business, and although the public will
be admitted, these sessions will not be
of general interest. The afternoon sessions will be interesting, but the night
sessions have been planned with the idea
of making the suffrage movement of
more interest to the general public. At
these evening sessions addresses will be
made by national speakers and prominent suffrage speakers of Tennessee.
Gentlemen are especially invited to attend the evening sessions.
All sessions of the convention will be 
presided over by Mrs. L. Crozier-French, 
of Knoxville, president of the Tennessee 
association.
Besides  the prominent Tennessee suf- 
fragists who will be in attendance, sev- 
eral   national   workers   will   be   present. 
The national board sends representatives
to   each   state   convention,   and   several
women   with   national     reputations     as
speakers   will  be  heard   here.
Chief among these are Miss Alice
Paul, of Washington, D. C, president
of the Congressional Union for Woman
Suffrage; Mrs. Medill McCormick, of
Chicago, chairman of the congressional
committee of the National Woman's Suffrage association, and Mrs. Ernest Seaton-Thompson, wife of the author-naturalist, who is chairman of the program
committee of the National Suffrage as-
sociation.
Besides the sessions of the convention, a number of social events have been
planned.
On the evening of Wednesday, October 28. following the opening session,
a reception will be held in the parlors
of the Imperial. On the afternoon of
Thursday, October 29, Ossoli circle will
entertain at the Lyceum building for
the   delegates  to   the   convention.   &quot;This affair is to be given in special compliment
 to Mrs. French, who is the founder
of Ossoli and is president of the Tennessee  Suffrage association.
Each afternoon of the convention some
social courtesy will be tendered the visitors, and the convention will be the
occasion of   unusual  club  and social activity
 in   Knoxville.
The first session of the convention will
be  held   on   the   evening   of   Wednesday,
October  28,   at  eight   o'clock,   when   ad-
dresses of  welcome,   with responses, will
be  made.    An   address   will   then   follow
by Mrs.  Mediil   McCormick,  of Chicago.

made   by   Miss   Alice   Paul     and   Miss
Maria   Thompson   Daviess.

<dc:description>PRESIDENT PROMISES NO
AID TO WOMEN WORKERS
Who Plead With Him For His Assistance to the Cause of
Woman Suffrage—In Response to Pathetic Appeals of
the Plainly Dressed But Earnest and Determined Delegates Mr. Wilson Regretfully Tells Them That He Can
Urge Nothing Upon Congress That Has Not Received the
Organic Consideration of the Democratic Party.
Washington,   Feb.  2. Women    workers
who toil daily in the mills and the
mines and in the sweatshops and the
factories of the nation pleaded with
President Wilson today for his assist-
ance to the cause of woman suffrage.
The President regretfully told them as
he  did  a   delegation last  December that
he could not urge anything on Congress which had not received the organic consideration of the democratic party.
Today's demonstration--not the brass band, the street procession, the colored pennants and battle flags of the cause, but the tale of hardship, of the struggle to live on low wages, of the sanitariums for those who sickened at their work and the heart-breaking tragedies of poverty--affected the President deeply.  As the delegation left the executive offices, discouraged and disappointed because they obtained no positive aid, they did not know that the President himself was depressed, perhaps even more than they, as he went to luncheon with his family.  He told friends afterward he wishes he could help, but saw no way to do it.  There is every reason to believe, however,  that the day gave added stimulus to the President's desire for early legislation on social justice and industrial reform mentioned in his first annual message. Five hundred women--old and young--most of them plainly dressed but earnest and determined, went to the white
house, but only a committee of twenty -
five with five speakers gained audience
with the President, the others waiting
until the argument had ceased and Mr.
Wilson  asked  to shake hands with all.
 Speeches by Delegates.
In voices often choked with emotion,
the five speakers recited a tale of modern industry, which they said, knew no
chivalry; where old and young women
worked side by side with men for inadequate wages and under conditions that
undermined health. Representatives of
the weavers, the laundresses, the capmakers, the hatmatkers, garment workers in ten eastern states addressed the
President.  Mrs. Glendover Evans, of
Boston, one of the leaders of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage,
introduced them in turn and each presented a  plea  from her  own viewpoint.  &quot;I don't have to make a speech to 
you.&quot; said Miss. Rose Winslow, of the weavers,
&quot;and  I am  so  nervous  that  I could not make one if I wanted to--because I don't address Presidents every day----.&quot;  &quot;They are human, just like everybody else,' interjected the President with a smile.  The President listened attentively to __________
President's Answer.
&quot;I need not tell you,&quot; he said, finally,
&quot;that a group of women like this appeals to me very deeply indeed. I do not
need to tell you what my feelings are,
but I have already explained the limitations that are laid upon me as the
leader of the party. Until ihe party as
such has considered a matter of this
very supreme importance and taken a
position on it, I cannot speak for it-
and yet I am not at liberty to speak as
an individual either. All I can say is 
that the strength of your agitation in
this matter undoubtedly will make a 
profound   impression.&quot;          Mrs. Evans was disposed to remind Mr. Wilson that in a conversation with her at Seagirt, N.J., when he was a candidate for the presidency, he showed a much more encouraging attitude toward woman suffrage.  &quot;we worked our finger nails off then to get you elected,&quot; she said, and added reflectively, &quot;but you were gunning for votes then.&quot;  &quot;Asking for the votes of the people,&quot; corrected the President mildly.  &quot;And we admired you for the way you did it.&quot; remarked Mrs. Evans.
The President said he was much more free to express his views then than he was now, but did not recall that he had taken any position on the question of woman suffrage. He never spoke on it in public during the campaign and to an iterrupting question once  at a meeting in Brooklyn, declared it was a state issue.  Persons close to the President say he believes it is a problem for the states to decide,  though there is reason to believe he never has made up his mind definitely on the merits of the question. He does not feel it incumbent uppon him however, to take a stand on it until the democratic party has fully considered it and this is the answer which he is determined to give all delegations of suffragists who come to see him in the future.
 The house democrats have called a caucus tomorrow to determine whether the recent unfavorable action of the rules committee on the proposal to create a committee on woman suffrage should be reversed.  The President has expressed himself  to one member of the rules committee as in favor of such a new committee.  Most of the arguments presented today revealed the aim of the women to correct industrial conditions with the ballot as a legislative instrument.  The President has told his friends that social justice should be administered by the United States government in all its branches regardless of the merits of the suffrage movement.  
&quot;Shaking and trembling,&quot; said Miss Margaret Hinchey of the laundry workers of New York, &quot;we come to plead with you.  You are so square and on the level and so much of a real democrat that I appeal to you to wipe out the injustice th____ _____the vote.&quot;          Miss Mary Schneiderman of New York, representing   the   capmakers, spoke with emotion of the hardships of women in mills and mines.  &quot;We suffer side by side with the men&quot; she said &quot;and in constant fear of losing our jobs.&quot;  As she told of many cases of suffering, the President's face showed his sympathetic interest.
&quot;It is not a democracy when only half have something to say,&quot;  contended Miss
Melinda Scott, of New Jersey, representing   the   capmakers union.   &quot;We   will
be glad   if   you   will   mention our cause
in your next message.&quot;
The last speaker was Miss Rose Winslow of Pennsylvania, representing the textile workers.  &quot;You are entirely too fair and intelligent,&quot; she said, &quot;not to know what is going on in the world.  In many cases with the working women it is either the sanitarium for tuberculosis or the streets.  I don't have to make speeches to you as we are too close.&quot;

The President smiled as Miss Winslow
who stood close to him, dropped her
voice to a conversational tone and con-
tinued her talk.
The President did not continue the discussion but expressed a wish to meet the
women   who   were   waiting   outside.
&quot;But they told us we couldn't all come
in,&quot; remarked Mrs. Evans.
&quot;It   must  be  a   misunderstanding,&quot;   said
the President and he sent work(sic.) out that
he would like to have the delegates come in.
The women came in, single file, passing
in one door and  out another.  Some of the
women declined to shake hands with the President, marching 
indifferently by, refusing to take his proffered hand. At
their exit, Dr. Mary Walker, in male attire, argued with the women that suffrage
was a state issue. She was not permitted
to  enter with  the delegation.
Pleas of the working women were
phrased eloquently and with a touch of
pathos and emotion as they described the hardships of women workers.
The   President himself     hastened     the
handshaking ceremony,    thereby ending the
discussion, though Mrs. Evans remarked 
that only ten minutes of the allotted fifteen
 had been used up.  The President began shaking
hands,   however,   cutting off further discussion.  As many of the women filed by carrying banners and with colored bands decorating their furs, they named their home states.  There was a tiny child in line with her mother. &quot;Hello, litte lady,&quot; said the President, &quot;you wouldn't be old enough to vote any way, would you?&quot; and the baby smiled.  The delegation left the white house in groups in animated conversation, some pleased, others disappointed and some even saying they were angry.  The bands departed without playing any more and the President and Secretary Tumulty crossed over to the white house quietly for luncheon.
The word was issued from the white house that the President would take a similar position on all delegations for woman's suffrage hereafter and that until the democratic party had taken a stand on the subject he would not try to force any opinion on it.    President Wilson, so successful here his inauguration been twice corralled- once by one of the famous fourteen pilgrims that marched to Washington and again by five prominent members of the National Suffrage Association who called to urge him to recommend a suffrage amendment to the federal constitution in his message to congress.  In his interview with the first lady, he smilingly allowed himself to be decorated with the yellow badge of the &quot;Pilgrim Army of the Hudson,&quot; and expressed great regret for the unseemly incidents  that marred the suffrage parade on March 3rd.  In reply to the committee, President Wilson said that he would seriously consider the question, and they must not think he was opposed to them, if in the pressure, of so many other matters he should deem it best, just now, not to ask congress _____ ________ women's suffrage.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN VOTERS
STILL PUZZLE
TO POLITICIAN
Doubt as to Where They Stand
in Coming Election.
SUPPORTING MRS. ALLEN;
FIGHTING MISS WATSON
Reported Plan to Have Feminine Voters &quot;Single Shot&quot;
for Legislative Candidate
—Surprises Promised.
For two years, or since the special
session of the legislature ratified the
suffrage amendment in August, 1920,
mere man has been racking his brain
in an effort to determine what the dear
ladies wouid do with their ballots. As
yet, however, no one seems to have
found an answer to the question, and
the politicians are still querying each
other.
&quot;What'll the women do?&quot; is one of
the most popular questions of the day,
and has grown nearly as monotonous in
political circles as has the hackneyed
answer, &quot;Damfino,&quot; it never fails to
bring forth.
When women were first granted the
right to vote, a majority of the men
folk agreed that they would not have
any great effect upon politics, as their
male relatives, such as husbands,
fathers and brothers, and in some
cases sweethearts, would control their,
sentiments with regard to candidates
and issues, and in that way maintain
the party lines in just about the same
ratio as existed before suffrage was
granted.
That theory, however, failed to satisfy the mere male, and be has continued
to dwell upon the matter and advance
theory after theory until he has built
for himself a political bugaboo.
As a matter of fact, the first theory
is, with just one exception, correct.
Women voters, at least those who have
made any study of politics, have in
a majority of instances adopted the political faith of their husbands, fathers
or brothers, and are as a rule even
more partisan than men. The great
majority, however, have made absolutely no study of politics or public
questions and will go to the ballot box
with the determination to &quot;vote
straight&quot; just as their men folk do.
The one instance in which the theory
is incorrect is with reference to women
candidates. The women, as all men
know, are perverse creatures and take
a keen delight in doing the unexpected.
In the coming elections they are planning to do the unexpected in both, the
county election and the democratic
primary. In other words, they have
been thinking for themselves and, although their methods of reasoning and
their final decisions sound rather inconsistent and illogical to mere man,
they have decided to do two unexpected
things.
One of these is to explode the time-
worn belief that, a woman is incapable
of grasping politics and will never learn
to plan and scheme for the success of
the candidates she favors. It is also
proposed to explode the belief that a
woman tells everything she knows. The
women of Hamilton county, or at least
the active portion of them, are planning
to elect Mrs. Penelope Johnson Allen
to the legislature, and are now waging
a campaign among women voters in an
effort to get them to &quot;single shot&quot; for
her. The plan has been in process of
perfection for some weeks and mere
man did not learn anything of it until
it leaked out yesterday through a nonvoting woman who had been approached and who did not know that
she was giving a political secret away
when she told a man about it.
Another surprise the women have in
store, and one which is absolutely inconsistent with the election of Mrs.
Allen, is the defeat of Miss Sadie Watson, woman candidate for register on
the republican ticket. The same group
of women who are backing Mrs. Allen
for the legislature are fighting Miss
Watson for the reason that they do
not believe a woman has any place in
public office.

strictly partisan as will their husbands. Many of them interviewed on
the streets and in the stores smilingly
admit that they do not know anything
at all about it. They are able to glibly
recite the names of the candidates
which will appear on their county
ticket, but cannot tell, in many cases,
what offices they seek nor who their
opponents are. Yet, in seven out of
ten cases, they say: &quot;Sure. I'm going
to vote. I think it's my duty. Don't

And the reporter agrees with them
and starts seeking another interview,
vainly hoping that he will find at least
one women who knows what she is

<dc:description>Tennessee Delegations.       
Following discussion   of   the   legislative
measure the convention   adopted   recom- 
mendation of a special committee that all 
the twenty-two memebrsof the two Tennessee
delegations, one headed by   Mrs.   L. 
Crozier-French of  Knoxville, and the other
by Mrs. James  McCormick of Memphis, be
given seats in  the  convention.
Delegates    from southern states at a con-
ference tonight decided to concentrate
their efforts toward the winning of a
southern state for woman sufrage within
the next two years. It was stated that
Alabama probably will be selected for the
campaign as it is proposed to introduce a
suffrage initiative petition in the next
Alabama  legislature.
Shaw Opposition Fades.
That the opposition to Dr. Anna Howard Shaw for re-election as president of
the national association has been dropped
was revealed tonight when nominations
for officers were submitted to the elections
committee. The time for presenting nominations expired at eight o'clock tonight.
Dr. Shaw's is the only name on the list
as candidate for head of the suffrage
body.
The list, of candidates in addition to Dr.
Shaw  follows:
First     Vice-President--Miss    Jean    Gor-
don, New Orleans; Mrs. Katherine Dexter   McCormick,  New  York.
Second Vice-President- Mrs.       Desha
Breckinridge,   Kentucky.
Third Vice-President- Miss Katherlne
B. Davis. New York, Mrs. Medill McCormick,   Chicago.
Corresponding Secretary -Mrs. Orton H.
Clark.   Michigan;   Mrs.    Jeanette   Rankin, Montana.
Recording Secretary--Mrs. Susan W.
Fitzgerald, New York: Mrs. Anne H. Martin,   Nevada.
Treasurer- Mrs. Henry     Wade    Rogers,
Massachusetts.
First Auditor-Mrs. Helen G. Miller,
Missouri.
Second Auditor—Mrs. Nellie N. Somer-
vllle,   Mississippi;   Miss Zona   Gale,   Wisconsin.
Election of ofifcers will be held next
Monday.
Senator Lea Speaks.
Senator Lea in his address at tonight's
mass meeting mentioned that he had voted
for a federal amendment to give women
the ballot because he believed suffrage
would increase the number of good voters.
&quot;In states where women vote,&quot; he said,
&quot;woman suffrage has opened more schools
and closed more saloons than all other
political movements combined.&quot; Senator
Lea urged suffragists to fight primarily
for state constitutional amendments and
also to support the national amendment.
A Speaker's Bureau.
The recommendation of the committee
for the establishment of a speakers bureau in connection with the work was
adopted    Then  began   the  debate  on  the
recommendation providing for further organization of congressional districts. The
committee advised that each state suffrage
board appoint a congressional chairman
who would appoint chairmen in each district to work under control of the state
organization.
Immediately upon the reading of this
recommendation, half a dozen suffragists
were on their feet calling for recognition
from the chair.
Miss   Kate  M.   Gordon   of New Orleans, 
Mrs.   Desha       Breckinridge   of     Kentucky, 
and   Mrs.   Harriet   Stanton   Blatch   of New
York   asserted   they   wanted   a  definite declaration   that the   national
congressional committee  should  not  interfere  with   work
of the  state  organizations.
Miss Mary Winsor of Pennsylvania said
that the Pennsylvania suffragists would
support    whatever    policy    the    committee laid down.
&quot;Whenever the committee says 'black list' a congressman, we will 'black lsit' him,&quot; she declared.  Miss Burnham, also from Pennsylvania, however, declined to subscribe to what she called Miss Winsor's &quot;sweeping approval of the congressional committee's actions.&quot;  Mrs. Grace Wilbur Trout and other memebrs of the Illinois delegation. empathically declared their desire for a policy which would prevent the publication by the the national committee of information relating to congressmen without the consent of the state associations.
Mrs. Medill McCormick, and Dr. Shaw both asserted that the congressional committee was designated to serve the state organizations and had no intention of attempting to orverride the state assocations' wishes with its work.  The motion as amended then was adopted by more then two-thirds majority vote.
Much interest was displayed by delegates today in the slate of officers of the nationaly(sic.) association adopted by the leaders of the administration element in a secret caucus which continued until after midnight this morning.  This ticket was headed by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw for re-election as president.  It was stated today by those in charge  of the conference that the selection of  Mrs. Katherine Dexter McCormick of New York for first vice-president,  was finally ratified by the caucus and that Miss Hannah Patterson of Pennsylvania, was chosen for the &quot;administration&quot; candidate for the office of second vice-president in place of Mrs. Desha Breckinridge of Kentucky, who was first selected for the place.  Confirmation was given today of the other selections on the ticket as announced last night.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mrs. M'Cormick Speaks.
&quot;My  idea   of  the object of  this  asso-
ciation,&quot; said Mrs. Medill McCormick, of
Chicago,  chairman  of
the congressional committee,
 &quot;is that we
want to
pass national legislation to give
women the ballot.    Among the ways 
open to us to obtain the vote are to secure the passage of the 
Bristow-Mondell resolution which
is similar to the resolution drafted fifty
years ago by Susan B. Anthony and
which requires ratification by thirty-six
states to become effective; to pass the
Shafroth amendment which provides for
submitting the suffrage  question to the
voters of each state through initiative
petitions and to go before the state legislatures for amendments of the state constitutions. The Shafroth amendment is
designed to assist the states to give
women the ballot by going around the
state legislatures. The more suffrage
states we have the easier it will be to
pass the Bristow-Mondell amendment.&quot;
Argument in behalf of the Shafroth
resolution was made by Mrs. Antion-
nette Funk, of Chicago, a member of the
congressional committee who appealed to
the delegates not to tie the hands of the
committee in Washington by restricting
 their means of operation.
&quot;Many suffragists seem to think that
the Shafroth amendment is a &quot;tobog-
gan-slide' into suffrage but they are 
under a misapprehension&quot; declared Mrs.
 Blatch. &quot;One of my reasons for objecting to working for it is our funds
 and workers are limited and besides we
 will have to resort to the Susan B. Anthony resolution eventually to gain the vote.
     I  do  not believe  in dividing our
 efforts but think we  should concentrate
every  energy upon the measure that will
bring  us what we want.  The Bristow-Mondell
 amendment gives us a chance to 
avoid  the referendum and with the
foreign element of voters in this country, I
believe it is not well to risk our cause to
a referendum.&quot;
Sharp   replies   wore   calleld(?)   forth   from
members   of   the   congressional   committee
and  their   supporters   when      Miss    Mabel
Vernon of Delaware criticised the committee.     &quot;There  are  only   a  few   more   states
which     would   help     the Shafroth amendment,&quot; she asserted.  &quot;Why
didn't the congressinal committee
get  out  in  the campaign
 states   and   help   them
instead    of putting their time on something that could not be accomplished in Washington?&quot;

Shouts of &quot;they did help&quot; came from all
over the hall and Mrs. Funk and Mrs. Mc-
Cormick were allowed to tell of the committee's work in the recent campaign.
Mrs. Valentine of Virginia and other
southern delegates said the southern states
would not care to accept the Shafroth
amendment, but that they would more
quickly grant woman suffrage through
their  state   legislatures.
Mrs. Helen Hill Weed of Connecticut,
&quot;General&quot; Rosalie Jones of New York,
and Mrs. Francis Burns of Michigan,
were among the ardent advocates of the
Bristow-Mondell measure, while Dr. Anna
Shaw, president of the association; Mrs. 
Desha Breckinridge of Kentucky; Miss;
Mary Stewart of Montana and Mrs. Grace Wilbur Trout of Chicago made vigorous
pleas for the  Shafroth  resolution.
When debate was closed there were a
score or more of delegates who still
wanted to express their views on the question. Mrs. Jenks' amendment to strike
out was lost by a viva voce vote and
Mrs. Brown's substitute motion for that
offered by Mrs. Blatch was adopted by
a vote of 194 to  100.
A motion offered by Mrs. Trout authorising the national board to endorse and
support a federal amendment for a national
initiative and referendum law was
defeated.
There are perhaps twenty-five million
women in the United States, something
over five million    of whom are    wage- 
earning.    There  are  more—far  more--
wage-earning women in this country
today  than there  were  men,  women and 
children  in   the   thirteen     colonies   upon the day when
those fundamental statements were penned.
Women,  because they are women, are taxed
without representation.  They are governed without consent.  They have personal and contractual, but no political rights. Those in the twentieth century, in the (missing)

<dc:description>Both Tennessee Delegations Are Seated.
By the National Woman Suffrage Association Convention at
Nashville, on the Recommendation of a Special Committee—One Delegation is Headed by Mrs. Crozier-French,
the Other by Mrs. M'Cormick. 
Decision is Reached Not to Limit Work Before Congress to Efforts For Passage of Bristow-Mondell Suffrage Amendment to the Constitution—Southern Suffragists Decide to
Wage Fight to Add a Southern State to Suffrage Column
Within Two Years. 
Nashville, Term., Nov. 13.—By a vote
of almost two to one the convention of 
the National American Woman Suffrage 
association here late today decided that 
its work before congress for the ensuing
year shall not be limited to efforts for
the passage of the Bristow-Mondell suffrage
amendment to the federal
constitution.    At an  earlier sesson the national association
declared by a decisive majority that its congressional committee
shall not conduct campaigns against
candidates in any state without the consent of the suffrage association in the state concerned.
The action of the convention on these
matters settled two of the most important questions
before the present convention--question (sic.) which have given rise to 
much division of opinion among suffragists
 during the last few months and
which had significant bearing upon their 
plans for next year's campaign.
The   debate   on  both   issues   was   de-
cidedly spirited and at times tinged with
 factional   bitterness. 
Tonight's mass meeting was in the
hands of the &quot;voters,&quot; the program being
under the auspices of the National Men's
League for Woman Suffrage with James 
Lees Laidlaw presiding, and addresses 
by Senator Luke Lea of Tennesee and
men and women suffragists from several  states.
Legislative Battle.
Consideration of the legislative measures
to be supported by the national association
in the coming year was fixed as
a special order of business in the afternoon session.
Much of the opposition to the administration's
plan to work before congress for other measures
in addition
to the Bristow-Mondell resolution came 
from advocates of the &quot;state's rights&quot;  idea  in   the movement.
Mrs. Harriet Stanton Blatch, of New
York, one of the principal champions of
one legislative measure plan, presented 
the   initial   motion   &quot;that   tne   Shafroth 
amendment be not proceeded with
by the national association in the next session of congress.&quot;
A substitute motion, offered immediately by Mrs. Raymond Brown of New
York declared ihat &quot;it is the sense of
the convention that the policy of the na-
tional association shall be to support by
every means within its power, in the
future as in the past, the amendment
known as the Susan B. Anthony amendment. And further that vve support such
other legislation as the national board
may authorize and initiate to the end
that the Susan B. Anthony resolution become law.
Mrs. Barton Jenks, of Rhode Island,
then moved to strike out  the  last sen-
tence  of Mrs.  Brown's substitute.    Im-
mediately at least a dozen women  were
on  their feet  shouting  for  a  chance  to
be heard on the motion.
 Miss  Jane  Addams,     who     presided,
recognized    Mrs.    George    W.    Bass    of 
Chicago who spoke warmly against limit-
ing the association's efforts to one measure.
Miss   Kate  M.   Gordon,   of   New
Orleans,  president  of  the  Southern  States        
Suffrage association, favored Mrs. Jenks' motion, 
asserting  that  she   did   not  believe
 in allowing the national board too 
great powers  in  initiating  legislation.
In the California section of the suffrage pageant two banners were carried which attracted considerable attention.  One bore the legend, &quot;Sacremento,&quot; the heart of California and the Capitol of the State,&quot; and the other proclaimed the proud fact that &quot;Sacremento women had voted the Commission form of government and elected the only woman commissioner in the world.&quot;  Mrs. Luella Johnson is the distinguished lady's name, and it is said that under her administration as commissioner of Education that the schools, health and sanitary condition have become ideal.</dc:description>

for  equal  work,   co-guardianship of  children   and   others  of   like  nature,   all   of
which were ably presented and discussed
pro and con.   To &quot;spice up&quot; the meeting
several freak bills  were presented,  such
as   &quot;a   bill   to   regulate    the    length, of 
trousers,&quot;   &quot;taxation   of   bachelors&quot;   and 
&quot;bill   to   regulate  the   dress   of  women.&quot; 
all  of which were very amusing.
Mrs. French acted as speaker and show-
ed much ability as a presiding officer,
both as to the general routine of legisla-
tive business and rulings on questions
of parliamentary law. The members di-
vided into two factions, the liberals with
 Mrs. Bossie O'Brien Hundley as leader
and the conservatives, led by Mrs. Myr-
telle W. Snell.  Miss Amelia Worthington was clerk, Mrs. Louise Owings Charl-
ton, page, and Mrs. Mae Kendel Hannum
as   messenger.
In  opening the session Mrs. French
 made an address on the status of women
 in the body politic of all states. She then
announced the several committees with
 the following chairmen: Judiciary, Mrs.
Laura Sharpe; education, Miss Florence
McCrossin; house, Mrs. Marilou Armstrong Cory; health, Miss Kate Eubank
Blackburn; industrial work, Mrs. Octavia
F. Frazier.  Among the first &quot;business&quot;
transacted was a motion to limit the
speeches to five minutes and to adjourn
at 5 o'clock; both of which carried. The
messenger introduced the governor's message as follows:
&quot;Governor's&quot; Message
&quot;State of Alabama, Office of Governor.
&quot;To the General Assembly: You have
assembled, in obedience to your conscience, to exercise your legislative power
for the honor and welfare of the people
of Alabama, including women and children.
&quot;Keenly alive as you are to the far-
reaching importance of your great trust,
I now give you information of the state,
of the government, and acknowledge that
through your lofty purposes, we are about
to enter upon a better era of happiness.
&quot;I regret that I cannot go into detail
as to the needs of our state in this mesasge, for the reason that I am very
busy at present, preparing my next speech in favor of the election of my worthy successor A.B. Homes.
&quot;With this masterful effort completed,
I have to fulfil an important engagement
with Horace Wood, of the People's Journal, from whom I expect to gain many
points upon the question of better  state service.
&quot;The Condition of the Treasury—From
a recent detailed financial statement, I
would recommend that the appropriations
committee make no appropriation for
school purposes, since there is only about
30 cents left in the treasury.
&quot;Because of my unquestioned loyalty
to the cause of woman suffrage, I confidently hope that all other shortcomings
of his administration be overlooked.
&quot;In closing, I would ask that of all the
legislation which has been urged from
this executive department, I wish to
stress most the stringent prohibition
laws, for which I have always so firmly
stood.
&quot;R.   R.   REPEAL.  Governor.&quot;
    Freak Bills Introduced
Mrs. Nellie Kimbell Murdock introduced 
the child labor bill and made a vigorous
appeal for its passage.   Mrs. Pattie Ruff-
ner Jacobs offered a bill to regulate the
wearing of trousers,  among the requirements  pf   the   bill  were    that    trousers 
should be not less than six inches from 
the  floor or less than  six inches below
the   knee   with   pockets  on   the   outside.
The  discussion   that   followed  was   very
amusing and the bill was finally shelved.
Miss   Helen   Benners   presented   a   bill 
looking to the taxation of bachelors over
30 years  of  age,  providing  for   the levying  of   a  tax  of  50  per   cent  of   the   incomes of all bachelors, the funds derived
from this source to be applied to the sup- 
port of widows with dependent children. 
A substitute to include spinsters as bene- 
ficiaries  of the system  caused a heated
discussion   and  the  bill   was   lost
Other bills were offered by Mrs. Cory,
Mrs. W. L. Beasley, Mrs. Morris, Mrs. 
Dora Fell, Mrs. Lillian Roden Bowron,
Mrs. Octavia F. Frazieir, Mrs. Retta L.
Ullman, Mrs. Prentice Read and Judge
Hundley, who offered a &quot;message from
Mars.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>MRS. M'LENDON
SCORES  FOES  OF
WOMAN SUFFRAGE
President of Georgia Association Pays Her Respects
to Bishop Candler, Senator
Smith and Others
_	
Editor The Journal: Hon. William
Jennings Bryan has truthfully declared, &quot;the forces of evil are battling against woman suffrage.&quot;
The opponents of woman suffrage
have published broadcast an open letter to that great man calling on
him to substantiate his charges. He
is too big a man to trouble to prove
anything to brewers, distillers and liquorites generally, for the passage
of national constitutional prohibition federal amendment and its ratification by forty-eight states has
set the seal of disapprobation and
condemnation on them forever. The
enforcement of the law is all that
is required now. Neither is it worth
his while to attempt to prove to
men in high places, in church and
in state, that they are playing into
the hands of evil men and women,
when they cast aside all reason and
common sense at the prospect of
losing control of the women people
of this country in the near future,
it is well, however, for the women
of Georgia to know why the Empire State of the South is so backward in advancing the interests of
the women, the other half of our
common humanity and therefore entitled to equal rights with men. For
some  reason   men  fear   women.
In 1914 Neil Bonner, president of
the Wholesale Brewers' association,
in his annual speech, said: &quot;We need
not fear the churches, the men are
voting the old tickets; we need not
fear the ministers, for the most part
they follow the men of the churches;
we need not fear the Y. M. C. A.,
it does not do any aggressive work;
but, gentlemen, we need to fear the
Woman's Christian Temperance
Union and the ballot in the hands of
women; therefore, gentlemen, fight
woman suffrage.&quot; In the 1915 suffrage campaign in New Jersey, the
leader of the anti-suffrage forces,
known as &quot;Boss&quot; Nugent, who was
then running for governor of the
state on a platform whose main
planks were the support of the
&quot;wets&quot; and the defeat of the ratification of the federal amendment.
James E. Ferguson, who directed
the campaign against woman suffrage in Texas, spent large sums of
money in advertisements over his
own signature in leading Texas papers. They were headed &quot;Again 'Em
All&quot;—meaning the two amendments,
both prohibition and suffrage. These
advertisements were scurrilous attacks on Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
president of the National Suffrage
Woman Suffrage association, and Dr.
Ana Howard Shaw, chairman of the
woman's committee of the Council of
National Defense.
What happened to James B. Ferguson, governor of the largest southern  state  in   the  union?
He was impeached, he was beaten
at the primaries by the women of
Texas, who would not endure a man
accused of misappropriating of public funds. Texas women demonstrated what they thought of Jara3S
E. Ferguson in their &quot;Hobby for
Governor&quot;   campaign.
It goes without saying that Hon.
Wm. J. Bryan knew what he was
talking about when he said &quot;the
forces of evil are battling against
woman suffrage.&quot;
Coming nearer home, let us consider Georgia. We have some in our
midst—some few anti-suffragists
outside that little association—opposed—to further extension—of suffrage to women, headed by Miss
Caroline  Patterson,     who    said   she&quot; never belonged to anything but a missionary society until she became president of the Anti-Suffrage association, located in the city of Macon,
Ga. She has received a letter from
Bishop Warren A. Candler. This letter to Miss Patterson was published
in the Macon Telegraph and he thus
declares himself on woman suffrage
in 1919.</dc:description>

<dc:description>BOTH SIDES
ARE BOLTERS
Returning Suffragists Tell of
Their Convention.
JUST LIKE REPUBLICANS
IN EVANS-BROWNLOW DAYS
Miss   Ervin   Says   Mrs.   French   and
Her Crowd Bolted, and Mrs. Mc-
Cormick's Followers Were
the Guilty Ones.
&quot;No anger or ill feeling—simply
jwomen standing for their ideals in a dig-
nified way,&quot; is the explanation of the recent division of ranks in the State Equal Suffrage association furnished by Miss
Margaret Ervin, president of the local
league.
 &quot;When the convention was called to-
gether there were things that had to
be accounted for. The minutes of the
Memphis meetings of the executive
board had to be threshed out and they
knew they would have to face the music,
so they bolted,&quot; said Miss Ervin. &quot;We
are the ones who had the majority, the
convention standing 75 for Mrs. McCor-
mick and 52 for Mrs. French without
the officers. They were divided four ancl
four, making 79 for us and 56 for Mrs.
French.
&quot;They tried to put over a filibuster
scheme by preventing the report of the
credentials committee to come up and
we put up with it during the morning
of the opening meeting and also during the afternoon. Mrs. French gave
us only fifty minutes to transact the
business of the afternoon and when she
declared the meeting adjourned in order
that we might take an auto ride I objected. Others also objected and when
she saw the majority was &quot;against her,
she stalked out of the room.&quot;
Miss Ervin explained in detail how
Mrs. French was late in arriving at the
convention hall the day following the
revolt and how Mrs. McCormick took
the chair and presided until the arrival
of the deposed head. She said Mrs.
French had a table placed at the other
end of the hall and rapped for order, requesting at the same time that her followers turn their chairs around and face
her end of the room.
Just One &quot;Mere Man&quot; Mixed
Up in the Feminine Squabble.
One member of the body who was a
delegate told of the sad experience of
Fred Jones, of Chattanooga, who was
the only man present. It appears that
Mr. Jones was suddenly pressed into
service when the rival factions started
to transact business. &quot;He carried chairs
from one end of the room to another
and had an awful time,&quot; she said. 
Miss Ervin vigorously denies that
Mrs. McCormick's faction, comprising
most of the members of the Chattanooga Equal Suffrage association, are
the insurgents. She stated posittvely
that that side was in the majority, and
therefore belonged to the regular ele-
ment. Miss Ernestine Noa, who was a
delegate from that league, pleaded for
harmony on the convention floor and refused to take sides either way, it is said.
When she announced that she would
withhold her vote on this account, it is
said that Mrs. French made a sarcastic
reference to all who were neutrally inclined.
Chattanooga Equal Suffrage association,
presumably on the ground that the two
organizations should co-operate to entertain the Southern States Suffrage conference, when it convenes here next
Tuesday. It is said that the Equal
Rights league agrees to 'reorganize in
one body, but the Equal Suffrage association refused.

<dc:description>Chattanooga Leagues
Take Separate Paths.
While the Chattanooga Equal Suffrage association took the stand against
Mrs. French, the Chattanooga Equal
Rights league rallied to her support, and
for their good behavior were rewarded
with credentials to a seat in thf national
convention. Mrs. W. N. Case so far is
the only delegate from Chattanooga to
the big meeting at Nashville next week
who is armed and equipped for war.
Like a German passport, Mrs. Case's
credentials are signed and countersigned
by the powers that were, and she is
fully prepared to have a voice in the discussion that is to come up when the recent disturbances are aired.
Which organization or faction will the
national convention recognize is the
problem that is besetting the minds of
the suffragists and the suffragettes—the
latter the insurgents. Miss Ervin says
it's utterly impossible for the main organization not to recognize Mrs. McCormick's side, while Mrs. Case is equally
sure that Mrs. L. Crozier French will
come out the winner.
Mrs. Case hinted that the whole trouble started over the national convention
meeting place, and says that body is responsible because they should have designated what city should have this
honor. Mrs. Case said she favored
Nashville because she was afraid Chattanooga could not creditably handle so
large a body of distinguished women.
It appears that recently offers of
reconciliation have been made to the
Chattanooga Equal Rights league by the (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
(Mortimer  Thompson.)
I  believe  in  democracy,  in  its  generic
sense,  democracy in  politics,  in religion,
in  economics  and in the family.
I believe democracy is no experiment to be tried but an evolution to be fulfilled.
I have   no   confidence in any institution among human beings that is not cornerstoned in the consent of those human beings.
Universal suffrage is necessary to that consent.   
Sooner or later women's suffrage must be established.  It is one of the stages in the evolution of democracy
and when one considers the great economic revolution of the last fifty years it seems strange that it is not already established.
Decent men no longer regard women as either serfs or idiots. Then why should they longer
permit their statute books to insult their
mothers, wives and daughters with the
implication? That honorable self-re-
specting women are indignant and sometimes break windows is
not surprising.
Heads have   been   browen(sic.)  with   far  less provocation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>gress was also left at home by his
constituents (male) and made a
place for the bravest politician in
the state. Hon. Wm. D. Upshaw,
who has the honor of being the
first representative from Georgia to
vote for the federal amendment
which is to enfranchise the women
of the United States of America.
Senator Hoke Smith does not like
federal amendments since one was
ratified which forces him to go before the common people and ask
them to vote for him the next time
he wants to go back to &quot;dear Wash- 
ington.&quot; He has instructed his
men, in the present Georgia legislature, to vote against the ratification of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment. Several of the men
who voted against it stated that
fact on the floor of house and senate. He does not want &quot;the electorate of Georgia enlarged&quot; for
then he will have to &quot;hustle&quot; to
persuade the women to vote for
him. But he wanted to use the
non-ratification of the S. B. Anthony amendment as one of the
main reasons for his reelection, as
an indorsement of his action in
the 65th and 66th congress in voting against the amendment, to enfranchise the women of this state.
He is striving to put off the evil
day (to himself) when he must
reckon with the women of Georgia.
On October 3rd, 1918 he declared in
his speech explaining his vote,
&quot;The best women in my state do
not want to vote.&quot; His sister and
two daughters are ardent suffragists. Comment is unnecessary.
Hoke Smith understands the women of Georgia will not vote for him
and a lot of men will do the same
way if their word is as good as
their bond. Bishop Candler and
Wm. Sam Adams of Savannah also wrote letters to the legislators,
so they said, begging them not to
ratify.
The covert and open insults to the
women, indulged in without protest
by the chair, and others opposed to
equal rights for women in Georgia,
will never be forgotten by the anxious women who crowded the galleries to see what men, elected to
make laws to protect women and
children, would do with the one thing
which is to give to the women the
right and the power to elect decent
men and women to the legislature of
Georgia.
&quot;The best laid plans of mice and
men aft gang aglee,&quot; and now come
to the front Messrs. McClatchey and
Moore with the comforting statement
that Senator Parker and Representa-
tive Jackson, from the county of
Jones, will have to do all their work
over again if they still want to obey
their &quot;bosses,&quot; the bishop and the
senator, and insist on placing Georgia
in the list of states that are afraid
of their women. All honor to Hon.
Tom Swift, of Elbert, who introduced the first bill in the house to
ratify the Susan B. Anthony amendment, but not &quot;for the purpose of
billing it,&quot; as Jackson and Parker
declared when they introduced their
bills for the purpose of killing. They
were so ignorant and so inefficient 
that their constituents should leave 
them at home.
Women who are always thankful 
for small favors are rejoicing that 
Georgia will have another chance to 
prove that she will keep up with 
states where women are on a plane 
of  equality with  men.
Respectfully,
MRS. MAPY L. McLENDON,
President   of   the   Georgia   Woman's
Suffrage Association.</dc:description>

<dc:description>IN THE INTEREST OF VOTES FOR WOMEN
KNOXVILLE POLITICAL EQUALITY  LEAGUE.
Committee—Mrs. Edw. Gillenwaters, Mrs. Henry Kelso, Mrs. David Meriwether, Jr.
Mrs.  Sarah Hood.

Rooks Suffrage Bill. 
For the last three weeks the attention 
of the Tennessee suffragists of all creeds
and classes has been focussed upon the
state capitol where, amid dramatic 
scenes and accessories, the so-called 
Rooks' Suffrage Bill has played a con- 
spicuous part.
This bill—which by the way, is &quot;mo-
thered&quot; by the Tennessee Suffrage asso-
ciation. Inc., whose president is Mrs.
Gilfred Dudley, of Nashville, was passed
without much protest or palaver in the
house of representatives by vote of
fifty-nine to twenty-five.  Hopes were
high that the senate would take the same favorable action. But alas, no! It seems that some of the senators were false to their party platforms and promises and fomented a conspiracy which 
resulted in the defeat of the measure  in spite of the eloquent advocacy of 
Senators Houk,  Ogle and others. 

However, the bill is &quot;not dead yet&quot;
 by any means, for at the last moment it was snatched from total defeat by a motion to reconsider, and, in consequence, 
 it will be called up for a second
hearing as soon  as the   legislature convenes again after the recess.
This  delay will not only give    the
suffragists time to strengthen their 
forces, but will afford the opponents the 
chance in remember their forgotten 
pledges and to retrieve their error by
joining in the movement to place the old
Volunteer State in the front ranks of
progress.
While it is generally conceded that the most logical and expedient way to secure the enfranchisement of women is by federal amendment, yet nothing would give the women of Tennessee such genuine gratification as to receive the ballot from the hands of their own men.  
Therefore, it is hoped that not a single
senator will   fail
in   his   duty   to   his
family,   his   state, his party, 
and    his
country when the day comes to vote on
the Rooks' Suffrage Bill.   S.H.H.

<dc:description>EVERYBODY NOT SATISFIED

The recent suffrage debate seems to have left some dissatisfaction among the pro’s as is evidenced by the very readable contribution of “A Suffragist” in last Saturday’s Staff. 
If “Suffragist” finds nothing convincing in the arguments of the winners, is not her insinuation concerning the quality of argument advanced by her sister suffragists rather cruel?  This insinuation is given more definiteness by the efforts of “Suffragist” to bolster up the “lost cause.”  Would it not have been more merciful to the losing debaters, as well as more enlightening to the nearly one hundred deceived listeners-deceived by the ratio of two to one-had “Suffragist” come to the defense of the “cause” in the person of one or both of the debaters?
It is encouraging to hear “Suffragist say, “I’m not up on feminism-but I will investigate the subject, because if half of me is feminist I want to know it.” For there is always hope for one who realizes her limitations.  Assuring that she is sincere in this confession and determination, I am subjoining herewith some information on the subject of feminism from the pen of Mrs. S. H. Guilford.  After “Suffragist” has thoroughly digested this expose’ of what is unquestionably the most disgusting and serious phase of the suffrage movement, if her nausea will permit, may we not have her observations on this-to her-new side of the question?
The Prof. Thomas referred to in this article, is a Virginian by birth and a Tennessean by adoption and marriage.  He was graduated from the University of Tennessee.  His wife is the daughter of the late Dr. James Park, a Presbyterian minister, of Knoxville, for years.  Prof. Thomas is a recognized authority on sociology.  Since leaving Tennessee he has become inoculated with the suffrage microbes, resulting in what was supposed to be a mild case of suffraphobia, but proving by his recent effusion in Chicago to be a well-developed case of feminism.  And still the suffragists patronize and approve him.
Following is Mrs.Guilford’s article:
If the anti-suffragists served no other purpose in the world but to tear the fangs of feminism from the specious serpent of suffrage that is tempting the women of our nation to eat the apple of political discord, that work alone would be worth while.  	
Many times the writer has thought that some of the antis have been rather severe in criticizing suffragists for feminism, but recent events show not only that all is justified, but that a great deal might be mentioned that is not even fit to print.
It was bad enough when the National American Woman Suffrage association circulated the “Bondwoman.” A pamphlet containing the following terrible doctrine:  “The freewoman’s concern is to see to it that she shall be in a position to bear children if she wants them without soliciting maintenance from any man, whoever he may be.”  It was worse when the socialist editor of the “Masses,” the most revolutionary magazine in this country, was put on suffrage platforms and his paper awarded a big advertising contract by the suffragists.  Countless quotations have been made from suffragists since 1837, which establish beyond all argument their enmity to the family, the home and Christian marriage, and are not worth repeating here, but it remained for feminism in official assembly at one of its largest conventions to reveal absolutely the sort of thing for which it is fighting.
	The recent Chicago convention of the suffragists was held mostly to advertise an internal row.  Columns upon columns were given to the press to try to make believe that the National Woman Suffrage association is less “militant” than the Congressional union, a thing that even Miss Lucy Burns, who was chairman of the national’s press committee, says is ridiculous.  But little was published regarding the speech of Prof W. I. Thomas, of the University of Chicago, who addressed the suffrage dinner at the La Salle hotel that city, on the subject of women’s rights to limit offspring and to become mothers without the formality of marriage.  The Chicago Examiner, however, a staunch suffrage paper, said the professor’s speech “came as a thunderbolt in an evening of fine wit.”
	The professor’s theories were graphically set forth-we do not care to quote such sentences.  But the surprising thing of it all is the sort of comment evoked by his remarks.
	Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National Suffrage association, is reported by the Chicago Evening Journal (suffrage) to have said:
	“You have to shock the people to make them think. The address has set every woman who heard it thinking, and they are thinking women who will consider both sides of such a proposition.  Political emancipation is not the only emancipation.  There is a greater freedom which women gain, the freedom of social relations.  Women are over-sex-developed and men are responsible for that condition. ***I don’t believe in mother’s love, I believe in mother intelligence.*** I believe Prof. Thomas took the proper place to present those views which have been buried in the minds of men for centuries.”
	It is true that Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, a Boston suffragist, who often attempts to apologize for feminism, told the professor that she believed women who had children “were entitled to a home and a husband, too,” but not one woman in that audience, according to all reports, has criticized the doctrine itself, which is essentially a twin sister to that of free love.  Mrs. James W. Morrison, who was toast-mistress of the banquet, said:
	“I invited Prof. Thomas to come, and I would not have missed his address for a great deal.  I do not care to say whether I would have invited him if I had known what his address was going to me.  I extended his time in order that he might apply some of the theories he set forth.”
	Several suffragists said that “taste” should have made Prof. Thomas present his views at some other time; others that they were too “advanced for this generation,” but one of them thought of the antis, and what such conduct would mean to the present campaign.  Mrs. M. J. Reynolds, president of the Political Union of New Jersey, said:
	“It was uncalled for and out of place.  In a short time the anti-suffragists will be making use of these statements, declaring that free love is the foundation of the ideals of suffragists.  It will be used against us, will do untold harm, and blacken us even to those who are friendly to our cause.”   Do you notice, however, in any of this a single word against the preachment itself.  But this is what the suffragists did about it: 
	Next morning the convention passed a resolution carefully denying the remotest intention to criticize the professor’s opinions, but thanking the Chicago Tribune “for not exploiting the story.”  After the “evening of fine wit,” during which these “advanced” ideas of “free” motherhood were set forth the only principle that seemed to actuate these women was fear for the antis, and a desire to see that the story did not get out.  Not one of them has condemned the professor’s proposition per se.  
	With the suffragists now exploiting Eugene V. Debs as a campaign orator, and selling tickets for his suffrage speeches at their headquarters; with the former secretary of the National Suffrage association now one of the directors in the “Birth Control League,” which is trying to secure legislation authorizing the teaching of race suicide and this shameful incident of “advanced” feminism in Chicago, the serpent of suffrage is stupid, indeed, if it believes it can longer conceal its feminist fangs. 
When the antis make it too hot for them a clique will get together, formally indorse marriage and motherhood and deny that they were ever at the Hotel La Salle, perhaps; or some obscure suffragist in Grasshopper, P. Q., will write to the papers to say that Dr. Shaw and the rest of them didn’t say anything of the kind, because she heard a suffragist speaker once and she didn’t say such things.  
	This is the real menace of woman suffrage-its diabolical alliance with socialism and feminism, which it attempts to conceal whenever it thinks it can fool the people-but flashes openly “with fine wit” whenever it thinks it safe and “if it will not get into the papers.”
…cause.
	Then the awakening.  It was “the Negro’s hour,” they said, and the women were deserted on every hand.
	Again and again, led by Miss Anthony, women rallied to the task of importuning congress to include women in the proposed extension of the electorate.  Again and again the men whose dependence they had been in the anti-slavery crisis failed them utterly.  Came at last the fateful ratification of the amendment, and a wording that forever closed that door in the faces of the women who stood without and waited. 
	There followed days, years, decades during which the principle of self-government was stultified and woman’s dream of political liberty was made the plaything and the fottball (sic.) of one nonchalant congress after another.
	But once more the country is ringing with the echoes of women’s part in a great national crisis, the crisis that was determined in favor of Wilsonian democracy on November 7.  Democrats profess their gratitude for what women did.  Republicans express anticipation of what women may do.  Because of her women, the west is conceded a new determinism in national politics.  The south revels anomalously in a victory attributed to an institution to which she has long turned a cold shoulder, woman suffrage.  The east discovers that it is an outrage to enfranchise women in the west and disbar them elsewhere.  And north, south, east and west, it is pointed out that only a federal election law can equalize the present insupportable political situation.  
	Once more a great opportunity confronts a great political party, the opportunity of being the instrument to insure political recognition to the last dweller within America’s gates.  Once more the women stand and wait.  Back of them stretches the record of tribute and acknowledgment, of praise and of promise.  
	In 1867 the republicans forgot.
	In 1917 will the democrats remember?</dc:description>

<dc:description>Suffrage Tactics.
Plans are swinging rapidly for
for the conventions of the congressional
union and the woman's party to meet
in Washington during inauguration
week, March 1, 2, 3 and 4, 1917.
Women suffrage is lending a complimentary indorsement  to &quot;watchful waiting&quot; that fully warrants President Wi-l
son in taking off his hat to the sentries
in courteous salutation.—-Washington. D. C, Star., Jan. 20.
    After six state referendums South Da
kota   has   begun   the   fight   for   the   en-
franchisement of Dakota women through
 the   Susan   B.   Anthony   amendment   to
the constitution.
     Secretary    of    War    Baker    strongly
urged     presidential     suffrage     for    the
women of Ohio   to members of   the state
legislature     who   called     upon   him     in 
Cleveland last week.
     &quot;There is far less excuse now than in 
any previous congress for shoving woman 
suffrage   into  the   closet   and   slamming
the door on it.    The democrats acknowl- 
edge that but for the women voters their 
jobholders would now be facing the un-
happy future of working for a living.&quot;—
 Newark, N. J.. Evening Star.
Australia   recently  paid   an  honor   to 
womanhood.     Mrs.   Kate    Dwyer,     the 
leader of the labor women of New South 
Wales   was recently appointed to a seat
on the senate of the University of Sydney, 
 with life tenure.     This is the  first
time that a woman has been called upon
to   fill   such   a   position   in the British Dominions.

A bill for presidential suffrage will be
introduced in practically every statu leg-
islature in session this winter.    The Illi-
nois act,  which grants the franchise to 
women  in   presidential    and    municipal 
elections,  will be used as a model measure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WHY WE GO ON
     Now  that  the  ballot for women is
so nearly won, why should not the 
 National American Woman Suffrage 
Asociation prepare to disband? This
question is sometimes asked. It was 
well and clearly answered by the Na- 
tional corresponding secretary, Mrs. 
Shuler, in a recent address before the 
Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Asso- 
ciation; she said, in part: 
&quot;It   is   asked   why   we   should      not
give  up  our  organization,    instead    of   
changing it  into a League   of Women
Voters. -        
&quot;In  the  first  place,  our work  is  not
done.     We   have   not   yet   secured   the 
ratification   of   the   Federal       Suffrage 
amendment   by   the   necessary   36   leg- 
islatures
&quot;In  the second place,  the machinery   
of our organization  has enabled us to
keep   together   a   band   of  women   who 
are  courageous,  and  willing  to  undertake legislative  work.    We should take
hold   of   the   constructive     work     now
needing  to  be   done.     When   the     gov-
ernment   had   big   work  to   do     during 
the war, it called upon  the suffragists,
and  they made a  colossal record.
&quot;Another reason why we should not 
disband our national organization is 
that so many of the questions in which 
women are interested are national questions, and therefore cannot be  turned
over wholly to the state legislatures.       
&quot;Again,   there must  always  be  some
grea t  force   which   agitates  and     educates, if the country is to advance: we 
ought to be it. 
&quot;Finally, we ought to maintain our 
organization because, while we have in 
our suffrage work some women of
great breadth of vision, yet the rank 
and file of women—and of men, too, 
for that matter—are uneducated in political affairs, and we must educate 
both the women and the men.&quot;
A.  S. B.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN IN PROFESSIONS.
&quot;Mrs. Winifred Harper Cooley of
New York is president of the Allied
Clubs of Domestic Science; a member and officer of the Domestic
Science club, of the Society for the
Promotion of Pure Foods and many
other women's organizations and a
recognized leader in all women's
movements in the east.
Mrs. Cooley was born in Indiana,
and   is   the   daughter   of   Mrs.   Ida
Husted  Harper,  one of the leading
woman   suffragists     in     United States.
She is the author of  &quot;The
New Womanhood&quot;    and    numerous
magazine   articles  on  food preparation   and   the   servant   problem.
By Mrs. Winifred Harper Cooley
Are  women   taking  men's  jobs  away
from  them?    Well,  who said they  were
 mens,   anyway?     Men   say   so,   to   be
tsure,   but   one   never   wants   to   give   up
 what  he  has.     There   are   several   laws
 recognized   throughout   the   world.     One
 of   them   is  the  law   of  supply   and   demand.    Another is that there is always
plenty of room at the top.
Girls are athletic nowadays,  and can
climb trees pretty well; so we find them
holding   big   salaried   positions   &quot;at   the
top&quot;  (for no earthly  reason except  that
they  are so absolutely capable of filling
them).
Folks say that it is eccentric for a
woman to be a hodcarrier or a dentist
or a photographer. Of course I must seem eccentric to the
pride of the harem when she looks out over her barred windows
 and sees a woman civil engineer
measuring  space or a woman architect planning to erect a library building. 
But   why  take   the  viewpoint of the harem?
Living  by  sex   is  an ancient occupation, sometimes remunerative, sometimes not.  But it is scarcely a very respectable one, and a good many women prefer living by their brain or their handiwork.
In   1807   there   were only   seven professions open to American women.
Today there are 371 trades
and professions.  Teaching is almost monopolized by them, although in the early days paid 
four dollars  a  week.     There
are some   6,000 women physicians, some of them house surgeons, heads of insane asylums and medical examiners for public school children.  There are several hundred women dentists, the first dentist to enter the Philippines having been Dr. Anna Sawyer.  There are 400 women pharmacists in the United States.  In New York city twenty women own and manage drug stores. 

... United States of America, who may raise no voice for or against any measure of government are children,
aliens, idiots, lunatics, criminals and women.  We, the last named item, desire to be removed from this catalogue, where we should never have been placed.</dc:description>

TENNESSEE ACTIVITIES
The executive board of the Tennessee
Woman Suffrage Asociation met in
session recently at Lookout Mountain.
A budget of $10,000 was voted ito be
raised by the year's work, each district to be assigned its quota.
Mrs. George Fort Milton, the new-
ly elected state president, presided at
the session and also at the luncheon
at the Hotel Patten, which was the
social  feature  of the gathering.
Mayor-elect  A.   W.   Chambliss     was 
present to make the welcome address;
Mrs. John M. Kenity of Nashville gave
the response. Other speakers were
Mrs. Guilford Dudley, a vice present of
the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Senator P. T. Carter, and representative L. D. Miller, all
of whom were honored guests at the
luncheon.
Mrs. R. B. Cooke of Johnson City
spoke as representing East Tennessee;
Mrs. John M. Ransom of Tullahoma
for Middle Tennessee, and Mrs. Isaac
Reese of Memphis for West Tennessee.
In introducing Mayor-elect Cham-
bliss, Mrs. Milton referred to him as
Chattanooga's best mayor, because the
first one ever elected by women. Representative Miller was introduced as
the legislator who secured the vote for
the women of Tennessee. He disclaimed the honor accorded him, saying that
the bill and everything else was in fine
shape when presented to him. Senator
Carter said he never dreamed he had
pleased so many people in helping push
the suffrage bill, which showed the popularity of suffrage in Tennessee. He declared that the women by their entrance into politics had made it impossible for any more &quot;crooked old
politicians&quot;  to fall  in line.
The Tennessee suffragists are planning a strenuous year devoting much
time to intensive organization work.
A state organizer will be engaged to do
educational work in the rural districts.
Mrs. Milton, the new president of
Tennessee, comes to her duties well
qualified to give Tennessee a banner
year. As she is a woman of rare tact,
judicial temperament, and endowed
with zeal and enthusiasm, as well as
a charming personality, she has the
qualities that make for good leadership. Mrs. Milton is prominent in social, club and church circles, and is
widely known through her clever pen,
which he (sic.) has used most generously on
behalf of the suffrage cause.
Her husband, as editor of the Chattanooga News, has been a staunch ally.
The new officers of the Tennessee
Woman Suffrage Association include:
Mrs. George P. Milton, Chattanooga,
president; Mrs. John M. Ransom, Tullahoma, vice president; Miss Carolina
Williams, Columbia, recording secretary; Mrs. L. T. Hill, Chattanooga, corresponding secretary; Mrs. D. T. Kim-
brough, Nashville, treasurer; Mrs. Reuben Mills, Nashville, auditor.

R.   B.   Cooke  of Johnson  City;  second,

<dc:description>Miss Paul's Address.
The chief talk was made by Miss 
Paul, who for practically an hour told
the story of the rise of the Congressional
union, of its work and hopes. If there
was anyone present at the close of Miss
Paul's talk who did not understand the
union, how and why it came into being,
what it has accomplished in the three
years of its existence, and what it confidently expects to achieve before the
present session of congress comes to a
close, it was not the speaker's fault,
for she certainly made it all as plain
as &quot;the nose on your face.''
Miss Paul, has, to a remarkable degree, the power of clear, logical speech.
She has trained herself to think on her
feet, and in her impassioned plea for
solidarity among women, for the dropping of petty differences, and for the concentration of the suffrage forces upon the
passage of the desired federal amendment, she stirred and aroused a desire
for action in every woman within the
sound of her voice.
The effect of Miss Paul's address upon
the audience was manifest in a practical
and substantial manner at its close by
the raising, within a very few minutes,
$350 for the work of the union.
The Knoxville Political Equality
league promised $50, the Johnson City
suffrage league $50, the Knoxville Equal
Suffrage leage $25, and the remainder
of the money subscribed was individual
contributions.
About sixty persons present allowed
their names to be placed on record as
members of the Tennessee branch of the
Congressional union.
The Time to Strike.
In her address, Miss Paul said that
the federal amendment has a better
chance of being passed during this congress than it will have again for four
years. This is due to the fact that
this is Presidential election year, and
one-fifth of the electoral votes, about
one hundred in number, are already controlled by women voters in twelve equal
suffrage  states.
This is why the speaker pled with the
women to unite; it is why she is asking
the suffragists in all the states in the
union to unite at this time and get the
amendment through congress.
&quot;The negro was enfranchised by the
passage of a federal amendment,&quot; said
Mis Paul, &quot;why should not the women
of the&quot; nation be enfranchised the same
way?&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Brilliant Event.
  The formation of the Tennessee branch 
of the union occurred amid the most
favorable circumstances. When it be-
came known that Miss Alice Paul, the
official head of the Congression unon,
was to come to Tennessee to form an
organization, and when it became fur-
ther known that this organization would
be effected in Knoxville, the Political Equality league, one of the three local
suffrage organizations, made arrangements for a banquet to be given in honor 
of Miss Paul, and it was at this that
the Tennessee branch was inaugurated.
Following the discussion of the menu, 
Mrs. G. W. Denney, who presided 
gracefully and charmingly as toastmis-
tress, introduced the speakers.
In the absence of the mayor, John E. McMillan,   who  was  to   have  made  the 
 first talk, Mrs. L. C. French, the veteran 
suffragist of East Tennessee, the woman 
who has fought many verbal battles for
the cause, was called upon, and as usual, 
rose   splendidly   to   the   occasion.    Mrs.
French said she had long secretly wished 
to.occupy  the  mayor's  chair,   and   that 
this was, at last, the realization of her
hopes.    Mrs. French  said she had been
in sympathy with the policy of the union
 since   its   organization,   for   the   federal 
amendment route is the most direct and 
 the least expensive way to the suffrage. 
  Capt.   William  Rule,     editor    of  The 
Journal   and   Tribune,   was   the   second 
speaker.    He   wished  the   union   speedy
and complete  success,  and  said  that  he 
was   willing   to   go   on   record   as  being 
one   man   in   Knoxville   who   was   not 
    afraid   the  affairs  of  the  nation   would 
go to destruction if the women are given 
 the right of franchise.
Mrs. W. F. Searle, vice-president of
Ossoli circle, who is a recent convert to
the suffrage cause, told how she &quot;saw (missing)e light,&quot; and became converted.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMAN'S PLACE IS WHERE SHE'S NEEDED.
The favorite war cry  of  the anti-suffragists
is &quot;woman's place is in the home.&quot;  The real truth is that woman's place is wherever she is needed.  There was a time when she was needed no where else but in the home (and she stayed there).  
   Does she now do so now altho   without the suffrage?  If her place is at home, why doesn't she stay there? (the antis included).
 Possibly     because     she      no
longer is obliged  to mold  candles,  make
soap,   spin  and  weave cloth   as   she   did
in  thai   golden age of  stay-at-home.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In The Interest of Votes For Women.  The Knoxville Equal Suffrage League,  Edited by Emma Farrand Tyler.
&quot;A good number of representative men
and women, responded to the call issued
by Mrs. H. C. Milnor, president of the
Equal Suffrage league last Friday for a
meeting to consider present work in suffrage  lines.
Knoxville women, as full fledged citizens now have responsibilities that they do not wish to assume ignorantly
and they are
therefore taking steps to gain thorough information regarding questions of civic interest which will hereafter be incumbent
upon them to help their brother-citizen
in deciding, here in our own beautiful
Knoxville. We were never more proud of
its beautv and its promising future than
today, and we desire with all the things
we have in trust to serve our city well.
Therefore,    the    Equal    Suffrage    league
realizing that its initial work was done, called this meeting where was formed an orgainization with larger aims, the non-
partisan political league, with which the
old Equal Suffrage league has become
merged.
This league which has thus been dis-
solved, is the parent suffrage league of the
city, having been formed in 1910, at the
home of Mrs. L. Crozier French. There
were 36 charter members. Its first officers
 were: president, Mrs. French; vice-
president: Mrs. N. K. Cooper, secretary:
Mrs. H. W. Curtis and treasurer Mrs. Fred-
erick N. Jones. Its object has been &quot;to ad-
vance the educational, industrial, legal and
political rights of women, and to secure
suffrage to them by appropriate state and
national legislation.&quot;
From  this  league has  been   formed   two
other   suffrage   organizations   in   the   city,
&quot;the Political Equality league and the Mar-
garent   Brent  club,   whose   presidents are
respectivelv,   Mrs.   C.   H.   Lucky   and Miss
Ada  Fanz.    Much interest in the new or-
ganization is expressed by  both  men and
women   and   it  promises  to   become a liv-
ing  center  of  great   benefit   to   the city.
LETTER PROM  BULLS  GAP    Some weeks ago a letter came into my hands, addressed to the &quot;Equal Suffrage League, Knoxville.&quot;'  It was from Mr. J.C. Self, principal of the high school at Bulls Gap, Tenn., stating that some of the high school girls were preparing to enter a contest on essay writing on some phase of the woman suffrage question, and asking for suggestions and literature.  Complying with these requests and expressing a keen interest in the undertaking, I asked that the 'prize essay' should be sent to me.
Feeling sure that our readers will be interested in this effort I am presenting the 
following essay, which was received this 
week. It is the essay which won the
prize at the high school meet held at
Rogersville. recently. The author is Miss
Velma Hale Addington. E. F. T.
WOMAN'S   PARTICIPATION    IN   CIVICS
To know the new, search the old.    War
has   shown   how   valuable   women   can   be
 in   civic   work.     It   has  proved   that   they 
are not  only  willing to  serve their country   but   that   they   are   abundantly   able. They are revolting against the ill health of
body   and   mind   incident   to   their   condition.   They are becoming ashamed of their 
own  faults  and   vices,   the  sense  of  help-
lesness  and   of irresponsibility   which   belittles   them.     They    know    things,    they
 are   learning   more   every   day,   and   they
 want  to   work   off this  energy  and   know- 
ledge.      This   nation   must    awaken   to   a
realization of the fact that the most dangerous thing on earth is a highly trained intelligent woman who has nothing to do.
Thw war is  finished  now  with its  great
emergencies   which   offered   them  so  many opportunities
 for service.    Something must be done
and   done  quickly   to   keep   them
honorably employed.
No man   is   a   good   father   who is   not
also   a good   citizen.       He   may     provide
everything  for   his   family   and   still   vote
against his wife   and   children.     No  woman
can be a  good  mother  who is not also a
good citizen.     She   may   train   her  chil-
dren in the way they should go while  they
are in the home and accomplish every sacrifice, and
 still be unable to protect her children 
against  conditions     outside    the home. 
We may   abuse   the force   of nature  but we cannot
obstruct    any   force   in   nature
without suffering disastrous consequences.
The woman  has   seen   the   great   need   of
her service and since she has so readily responded to the
call the  stupid effort to close her up will 
prove   ineffective and  even more disastrous in the future than it has been in the past because there is a
rapidly developing intelligence and a good growing desperation to try Eve's fate with Adam in the open, where the curse imposed was the blessing of being obliged to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.  Women have taken and are taking today great interest in the civic reform educationally.  The women of today are see- (missing)</dc:description>

Colonial Period—Under several
colonial governments women
voted.
American Revolution — Women
demanded to be included in government. Abigail Adams wrote
to her husband, John Adams, &quot;If
women are not represented in this
new republic, there will be another  revolution.&quot;
In 1848—Woman's rights convention at Seneca Falls, New
York, arranged by Lucretia Mott
and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the
first big suffrage demonstration
in this country.
In 1872—Miss Susan B. Anthony made the test in 1872 of
voting at the polls. She was arrested, refused to pay her fine,
but was  never jailed.
In 1875—Miss Anthony drafted
the Woman Suffrage amendment,
which reads: &quot;The right of citizens of the United States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any
state on account of sex.&quot;
In 1878—Amendment introduced
in senate by Senator Sargent of
California.
State Campaigns—By the end
of 1912 women had won the right
to Vote in nine states. Wyoming (1869), Colorado, Utah and
Idaho (1894), Washington (1910),
California (1911), and Kansas,
Arizona and Oregon (1912).
In 1913—The women of Illinois
won state and presidential suffrage. In 1914 the women of
Montana, and Nevada were enfranchised; in 1917 the women of
New York, and in 1918 the women
of Oklahoma, South Dakota and
Michigan.
Organization of the National
Wonman's Party—When the National Woman's party, then called
the Congressional Union, was organized in 1913 to concentrate on
a campaign for federal amendment, no action or even debate on
the federal amendment had taken
place in congress since 1887. Politicians were opposed and political
party platforms silent about the
amendment.
Within seven years every political party had included in its
platform an equal suffrage plank.
President Wilson had publicly appealed for the passage of the
amendment as &quot;a vitally necessary war measure,&quot; the amendment had been passed by both
houses of congress and ratified
by thirty-six states, while political leaders vied with each
other for the credit of the victory.
The National Woman's party
from the beginning adopted the
policy of holding the party in
power responsible for the fate of
the amendment and brought pressure on that party through the
political power already in the
hands of the western women.
Most spectacular of the demonstrations was the picketing of
the White House, which began in
January, 1917, and lasted until
November, 1917. During the
picketing between 400 and 500
women were arrested for the
crime of reminding the President
of his responsibility for their enfranchisement and sentenced to
prison terms ranging from three
days to seven months. These arrests were later declared by the
District Court of Appeals to have
been  illegal.
In 1918, January 10—Two weeks
after the last pickets were re- 
leased from jail, and one year
from the day the first picket line
went out, the federal amendment
passed the lower house of congress.
In 1919, June 4—The senate
passed the amendment with two
votes to spare. The house had
repassed it on May 21, 1919.
In 1919-1920—Special sessions
of twenty-nine legislatures had
to be called to secure the neces-
sary thirty-six ratifications. In
all but five of the thirty-six states
campaigns upon either the governor or the legislatures were necessary.
In the first month after the passage of the amendment by  congress,  nine  states  ratified,  Wis-
onsin,     Michigan,     Ohio,     New
York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Mas-
sachusetts and Texas.
The three states which ratified
within a few hours of each other
on June 10, Wisconsin, Illinois
and Michigan, fought for the
honor of first place on the ratification rolls.
Kansas, the first full suffrage
state to act, set a new record on
June 16. The members of its
legislature, at their own suggestion, paid their expenses and
met without salary in a special
session. Now York was the second state to meet especially for
this purpose, and then Texas,
desiring to be the first southern
state to act, met in special ses- 
sion on June 28.
The half mark was passed by
the ratification on November 1 of
California.
The most difficult campaigns
occurred in the last few states,
particularly in New Jersey, West
Virginia and Delaware. The opposition resorted to every possible device to defeat ratification
or to substitute a referendum. In
West Virginia the amendment
was saved by one vote, that of
Senator Bloch, who rushed from
California by special train to turn
the scales.
&quot;Tennessee, the thirty-sixth
state to ratify, thus completing
the requisite number to make the
nineteenth amendment effective,
acted the past week. The state
senate ratified on Friday last, by
a vote of 25 to 4, and the house of
representatives adopted the resolution on Wednesday of this
week, the final vote being 50 to
46, after which Speaker Walker
offered a motion to reconsider,
with the expectation of bringing
it up for consideration on Thursday or Friday.   </dc:description>

<dc:description>WILSON PLEA FOR SUFFRAGE.
Democratic Party Pledged, He Telegraphs Tennessee Senate.
An earnest hope that the Tennessee
senate will reconsider its recent action
in rejecting a woman suffrage bill was
expressed by President Wilson in a
telegram yesterday to the president of
the senate. The measure already had
passed the lower house of the legislature, and the president said he felt the
upper house was shirking a moral responsibility when it refused to accept
it.    The telegram follows:
&quot;Hon. W. R. Crabtree, president of
the Tennessee senate: May I not express
my earnest hope that the senate of
Tennessee will reconsider the vote by
which it rejected the legislation extending the suffrage to women? Our 
party is so distinctly pledged to its 
passage that it seems to me the moral 
obligation is  complete.
&quot;WOODROW WILSON.&quot;      </dc:description>

FEDERAL SUFFRAGE
Amendment.
Passed by the house May 21, 1919.
Passed  by  the   senate June  4,   1919.
Signed by Speaker Gillette June 4.
Signed by Vice President Marshall
June 5.

Arkansas ratified July  28.
Montana  ratified  July   30. 
Nebraska ratified August 1. 
Georgia's legislature refused to rati- 
fy the federal suffrage amendment—the 
first legislature to take adverse action.
A democratic legislature and a southern one. First state in the Union
to reject the amendment. That was on
July   24.
Now it appears, from incontrovertible evidence, up in the offices of the
N. A. W. S. A. that there is the liveliest
sort of challenge of the legislature's action as not representative of Georgia
sentiment and spirit. The challenge
comes from the very heart of Georgia,
the press of the state.
lt is not alone such papers as that
staunch champion of democracy, Mr.
Clark Howell's Atlanta Constitution
(democratic) which is filling up its front
pages with records of the suffrage
movement and its editorial pages with
impassioned rhetoric for justice to southern women, but papers small and
great from towns all over the state as
well—papers which are straight party
organs at that.
&quot;Why is it that the state of Georgia should forever and always be last
in the procession of progress?&quot; asks
the Savannah Press (democratic), and
(the Columbus Ledger (democratic) takes
up the qeustion(sic) and repeats it. &quot;The
Ledger is surprised at the action of
the Georgia Legislature&quot; in its action
on the woman suffrage amendment—
it add(sic) more mildly than the Savannah
Press, which indagnantly(sic) wants to
know,' &quot;Why should the state of Georgia advertise to the world that we are
a backward and a slow-minded people? The majority of the legislature is
opposed to suffrage. Of course we can't
blame them for that. The fault is not
theirs that their intellects are limited
or their consciences dwarfed. We, the
people, have elected them. We are to
blame, not they. No rational person
hopes to defeat the amendment. All
that can possibly be done is to write
down Georgia as one of the few, if not
the only state, that opposes right and
justice with  her  own  feeble bulk.'
It sounds as if Georgia newspaper
folk are more than a liittle ashamed
of thir(sic) representativs(sic). It also, sounds
as if some of those politicians may
have beyen &quot;monkeying with a buzz-
saw&quot; as far as re-election prospects go.
Continuing over the state one meets
more of the same sort of shame faced (partially missing).
&quot;Georgia legislature are not showing
themselves any too well abreast of the
sentiment of the age,&quot; comments the
Cobb county Times of Marietta (Independent). And the Marietta Journal
(democratic adds in true southern style:
&quot;It looks like some of our legislatures
are trying to get another political
'black-eye' for Georgia by the way they
are acting on the &quot;suffrage question.&quot;
&quot;We have tried to reason out the attitude of the politicians in this state
who continue to keep up the fight
against woman suffrage. Their attitude is going to hurt the democratic
party and hurt the state. If democracy wins it will be in spite of the Georgia reactionaries. We believe there is
a sordid reason somewhere for the present loud-mouthed opposition.
&quot;If the Georgia legislature refuses to
ratify woman suffrage it will do the
democratic party an incalculable harm&quot;
says the Fitzgerald Leader (democratic), &quot;and will no more stop the progress of woman suffrage than a match
stick on the track will stop a locomotive. The negro has just as much
right to the ballott now under manhood suffrage as he will have under
universal suffrage, no more, no less. As
for the states' rights question, this suffrage amendment is not being passed
by the federal government. The federal
government has no power to amend
the constitution. The states are amending the suffrage laws by ratifying the
amendment. As far as affecting woman's place in the home women's suffrage will be unfelt. Woman's place is
where she wants to be. For reasons
of party policy and principles of justice, the Georgia legislature should pass
the   woman   suffrage   amendment.&quot;
&quot;We have never believed it (woman
suffrage) wise,&quot; says the Commerce
News (democrat), of Georgia, &quot;Nevertheless, the politicians in the Georgia
legislature had better treat the problem with courtesy—every lick below the
belt hastens the coming of woman suffrage.&quot;
And the stalwart Marietta Journal
again comes to the fore with :&quot;It has
been the licks hit below the belt hit by
politicians that made the woman suffrage necessary in this country. What
Georgia does will not affect the ultimate result so far as suffrage is concerned; but it may have a blighting
effect upon the national democratic
party and hurt the state otherwise if
we do not treat the women fairly in
the matter.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Boston woman writes.:
&quot;As a prospective voter, I take the
liberty of writing you regarding a vital
question of the day, which it seems
to me the women should turn their attention to at once, and by concerted action try to relieve a dangerous and difficult situation.
&quot;I should like to ask if the suffrage
organization has made any effort to
lower the cost of living? I believe, if
serious endeavor was made by the
women, something might be accomplished.
&quot;The law-makers are simply wasting
their time calling for investigations,
advertising their views in the press, and
in public speeches denouncing existing
conditions. What is needed is action,
fearless   and  determined.
&quot;From my own little sphere of observation, I think there are several agencies at the root of high prices of food;
profiteering on the part of the retailer, control by price-fixing agencies, no
limits to the amounts put into cold storage and high rates of transportation.
If we have laws to control any of
these agencies, they should be enforced. If we have no laws, then something should be done along that line. |
I heard a butcher the other day,
in speaking of the fish investigation, 
say: 'The men have been jailed, but
prices remain just as high.' Every time
you shop you hear remarks about living expenses, but nothing is done. Nobody makes any move to relieve the
strain, or avert calamity.
&quot;Some months ago I attended a
meeting of the Householders' Alliance,
which was reported as called for the
purpose of dealing with this question.
Most of the afternoon was spent in
reports foreign to the subject. There
were many strangers present, as I
was. Two or three of us tried to
bring about some constructive action, but nothing was accomplished. &quot;We
were told to watch the papers—the
press would be the instrument. I have
watched in vain, while the situation
grows worse.
&quot;It is the middle-class, like myself,
who are suffering. The rich don't nor do
the men in Washington actually feel the
privation that I and my family are experiencing.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>QUESTIONS   THAT   INTEREST   WOMEN  VOTERS.
&quot;Sister Is Primping for the Ballot-
Box Party.&quot;
This title, in big letters, runs across
a whole page of the Boston Sunday
Globe, devoted to a symposium of the
question whether women will make good
as voters.
Helen MeDaniel of the National Civic
Federation urges women to be open
minded, and predicts that in matters of
social welfare they will renounce par-
tisanship. A leading anti declares that
women as voters have dolefully failed to
make good.
President Woolley of Mt. Holyoke Col-
lege says: &quot;The majority of women will
doubtless enroll in the established par-
ties. The party which shows the most
progressive attitude with regard to in-
ternational policy, and questions of
social and political welfare at home, will
attract the woman who has a social
conscience and thinks for herself.
&quot;If the old established parties become reactionary this type of woman
will ally herself with the new party
certain to arise under these circum-
stances, a party composed of men and
women. There is little likelihood of a
'Woman's Party,' the cleavage will be
not along sex lines, but between the men
and women who look forward and the
men and women who look backward in
their thinking and  acting.&quot;
Mrs. Elizabeth Tilton, state chairman
of the National Physical Education Ser-
vice, urges women to make good by
working for better health conditions, es-
pecially among children, to counteract
the decline of national health due to
modern industrialism. She says, in
part:
&quot;The International Red Cross has
called for a great child conservation
movement through the world.
&quot;In Milwaukee the Red Cross has
placed scales in every school, that all
children may be weighed and measured, and those discovered to .lbe under
par weeded out and given, under the
supervision of the school doctor and
nurse, the corrective treatment necessary. Knowing that so much works
back to under-nourisbment and to the
popular fallacy that milk is a drink,
not a food, the Red Cross is running
milk wagons to the schools at recess
and to the playgrounds. In the meantime there has been formed at Washington a National Physical Education
committee authorized hy the Government to put forward legislation that 
shall tend to reduce to a minimum the
defects revealed by the draft. This
legislation, manifold in its variety, can
never be got through without the women. </dc:description>

<dc:description>TENNESSEE MAY
SAVE SUFFRAGE
Governor Urged to Include Rati-
fication In Extra Session;
Opinion Given.
Special To The Knoxville Sentinel.
WASHINGTON, June 21.—Tennessee may save the suffrage situation.
A provision in the constitution of
this presidential suffrage state, which
requires that a legislature must be
elected on the question at issue in a
constitutional amendment before it
can vote on ratification has been held
up to this time to prevent that state
from ratifying before 1920 elections.
The decision by the supreme court
in the Ohio referendum case is now
however, according to a statement issued by the National Woman's party
held by the best legal authority to
invalidate that state constitutional
provision—a similar provision also
exist in the constitution of Florida.
Every effort will be made by the
National Woman's party to induce
Governor Roberts of Tennessee to
respond favorably to the resolution
recently passed by the state democratic convention urging him to call
a special session to provide the machinery for women to exercise the
presidential suffrage accorded them
under the state law in the coming
elections and to include in his call
the ratification of the suffrage
amendment.
A letter was sent to him by Miss
Sue White, Tennessee chairman of
the Woman's Party, formally making a request for an immediate special session.
Miss White, who has been in consultation with the solicitor general
of the United States and other legal
authorities stated a the headquarters
of the Woman's Party today:
 &quot;I discussed this matter with
Solicitor General of the United
States, W. L. Frierson, a member of
the Tennessee bar and one of the
foremost lawyers of the country.
His official position deters him
from giving a written opnion, and I
have not the authority to quote any
opinion he may have expressed privately, further than to say that from
my construction of all that he said,
I am quite sure he has considered
the question quite carefully and if
in position to express an opinion for
publication it would be to the effect
that ratification by the present
Tennessee legislature would be legal
and proper under the principles laid
down by the supreme court of the
United States in the Ohio case.&quot;
Senator   Walsh,   of  Montana  in
letter to Miss White dated June 18,
said:
&quot;The question you propound.. . .is
a most interesting one, the proper solution of which is not simple. I am
impressed, hewever, with the view
that it follows logically from the decision of Hawke vs. Smith by the
supreme court of the United States,
popularly known as the Ohio case,
that the attempted restriction in the
Tennessee constitution on the authority of the legislature in that respect  in   ineffective  and  inoperative
&quot;There is, in my mind, scarcely
any limit to which one must not go
logically with respect to conditions
and restrictions which may be
thrown about the act of ratification
by the legislature through constitutional provisions, if we admit the
validity of the specific restriction appearing in the Tennessee Constitution.&quot;
Joseph W. Folk, also in a letter
to Miss White, expressed a similar
opinion. He said in part: &quot;The
supreme court of the United States
held that the federal constitution
provides the method for its amendment, one of the methods being by
the ratification of the legislatures of
three-fourths of the states. The
court held that this authority of the
federal constitution can not be limited or restricted in any way by pro-
visons of the state constitutions....
&quot;The provision of the Tennessee
constitution in question is clearly an
attempt to require that all proposals
for the amendment of the federal
constitution shall be submtted to a
vote of the people of the state as a
condition precedent to ratification by
the legislature of that state. This is
what the supreme court of the United
States has held could not legally be
done. Therefore, in my opinion,
ratification by a special session of
the legislature, duly called by the
governor, by proclamation including this subject, would answer the
requirements of the federal consti-
tution and be a legal and binding
ratification of the nineteenth amend- 
ment.'</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN'S RIGHT TO
VOTE IN TENNESSEE
IS UPHELD BY COURT
May Cast Ballots in Municipal and Presidential Elections
Without Payment of Poll Tax, Supreme Court Rules
in 4 to 1 Decision Declaring Act Constitutional—Sep-
arate Boxes Not Compulsory.
(By Wm. H. Swiggart, Jr.)
Nashville, Tenm, July 26.—The women
have won their right in Tennessee for
equal suffrage with men in all elections
for President and Vice-President of the
United States, and for all officers of
cities and towns throughout the state.
The supreme court today overruled all
objections to the statute of 1919 granting women the right to vote in such
elections in Tennessee, and declared the
new law valid and constitutional, overruling Chancellor James B. Newman, of
Nashville, who recently held the act unconstitutional.
Women may vote without payment of
poll taxes until further legislative enactment, the supreme court held.
While the law does not compel separate ballot boxes for women, the supreme court advised that separate boxes
be provided in elections where some of
the candidates are running for offices
for which women are not permitted by law to vote.
The statute which was upheld by the
court provides that &quot;all women, citi-
zens of the United States and above the
age of twenty-one years, having resided
in the state for one year and in the
county for six months preceding any
election therein, and who shall be an
inhabitant of the election district or precinct in which they offer to vote, shall
be entitled and allowed to vote at such
elections for electors of President and
Vice-President of the United States, and
for all officers of cities, towns and tax-
ing districts, and upon all questions or
propositions submitted exclusively to a
vote of the electors of such municipal-
ities.&quot;
The constitutionality of the law was attacked in a suit brought by John J.
Vertrees and other prominent citizens
of Nashville, in which it was claimed
that since women were given the right
to vote without the payment of poll tax,
it was an unjust and unreasonable discrimination against men who are re-
quired to exhibit a poll-tax receipt before they can vote. It was also claimed
that the statute could not be put into
effect without destroying the purity and
fairness of all elections because it did
not provide for a separate ballot-box for
the women in elections for officers in-
cluding some for whom the women could
not vote, so that there would be no way
to ascertain which ballots were cast by 
women and which were cast by men,
and no way to determine whether the
women had voted for officers for whom 
[they] were not entitled to vote. These
[were] the principal   grounds  of  attack, 
 which were overruled.
Justice Bachman Dissents.
The opinion of the supreme court was 
prepared and delivered by Justice Grafton
and concurred in by three 
members of the court. Justice
Bachman dissented from the majority 
opinion, holding that the statute is unconstitutional because unreasonably discriminating -against the men in permit-
ting women to vote without the payment
of poll-tax, while men are required to
pay the poll tax before exercising the
same  Voting  privilege.
The opinion of the court indicates
that the court exercised care in determining the constitutional questions involved in the case without regard to
questions of policy, such questions being
exclusively for legislative determination.
In the concluding portion of the opinion
the court said: &quot;Chapter 139 of the acts
of 1919 was passed after long discussion
and after the failure of similar acts in
previous legislatures. It embodies a
policy deliberately adopted by the legislature of the state after much agitation. All bias as to such policy must
be scrupulously laid aside in the consideration of the constitutionality of the
act.
'The objections to this act have been
presented with all the learning and force
possible. These arguments harmonize
with what were pre-conceived notions of
many of the profession. When the matter is probed, however, nothing is to he
found in the premises, except in the one
particular noted.&quot;
Only One Exception.
The &quot;one particular&quot; in which the
statute was declared to be ineffective
consists of elections held for the purpose of determining whether &quot;the credit
of any county, city or town shall be
given or loaned to or in aid of any
person, company, association or corporation.&quot; In such elections it was held
that the constitution confines the right
to vote to male voters.
As a result of the opinion of the supreme court, women will have the right
to vote in municipal elections, and for
President and Vice-President , without
paying poll-tax; but the court holds that
the legislature has the power to levy a
poll tax against women, and whether
the tax will be levied will be a question
for the next legislature, as it is not probable a special session will be called for
that purpose.
The opinion upholds the right of election officers to provide separate ballot-
boxes for women voters, but it is held
that separate ballots need not be provided for the women. On this question,
the opinion concludes as follow: &quot;We
accept as correct the opinion of the legislature expressed as indicated, (by the
resolution adopted when the statute
was passed) that the election officers
have the power to provide separate ballot-boxes, and we take it as a matter of
course that the election officers will
adopt the advice of the legislature and 
duly provide separate ballot-boxes for
elections in which candidates are run- 
ning for only part of whom women are
entitled to vote.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>In The Interest Of Votes For Women
Edited by Emma Farrand Tyler.
HURRAH FOR TENNESSEE
Tennessee women will not be deprived of the fruits of their victory in
obtaining the passage of the presidential and municipal suffrage bill, the
supreme court of that state having
declared the new law constitutional
and valid in a decision handed down
on July 26. All objections made by the
opponents of the law were overruled.
A number of Nashville citizens  had
attacked the constitutionality of the
act for various reasons, one of which
was that the failure to require the women to pay poll tax was an unjust discrimination against the men, who are
required to show tax receipts before they can vote. Another point of attack was that the purity of the ballot
was endangered by reason of the failure to provide for a separate ballot
box for women in elections where
there were some candidates for whom
the women could not vote under the
terms of the law. Both of these objections, together with others raised,
were overruled by the supreme court.
Under the terms of the Tennesse
law women may vote for president
and vice president and for municipal
officers.
Mrs. Guilford Dudley, a Tennessee
leader who is also a vice president of
the National, wires, &quot;We are voters,
hurrah!&quot;
It is a victory that is complete, except that the courts hold that under
the   Tennessee   constitution,   by   reason
of the peculiar provisions of it, women cannot vote upon questions of
lending the credit of municipalities to
an outside person, firm or corporation
This does not mean ordinary municipal
bond issues. Such a question is not
likely to arise in ten years.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN REGISTER
TO VOTE IN FALL
Supplemental Registration Three
Days    Beginning
October 13.
The poll tax question will not enter into the question of women voting in any and all elections this fall
just like the men, in the opinion of
Walter   Warters,     secretary    of   the
Knox  county    election     commission.
Mr.  Warters  states he  believes  that
the   women   can   vote   regardless   of
poll  tax  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that
they were not qualified to vote when 
the   ruling   was   made   that   no   one 
could vote who had not a poll tax receipt   dated   thirty   days   before   the
election or August 5.
Supplemental   Registration
Women however, who have not
registered will be required tp register
in the supplemental registration
which will be held twenty days before
the election of November 2, states Mr.
Warters.
Since the amendment has been ratified Mr. Warters states he believes
the registration of women will be
heavy this fall, because of the fact
that their eligibility to vote in every
election, will command the interest
of women throughout the state. The
great tax question is of great interest
to every woman who owns property,
it is stated, and for the first time
women will be allowed to vote in
the state elections where tax measures are determined.
Strengthens Democratic Ticket
Democratic leaders in the city who
have been heard to express themselves have stated that the enfran-
chisement of women for participation
in every election, will rebound to the
strength of the democratic ticket in
the state and will add measurably to
the prospects of the democratic national ticket from the fact that ratification by a democratic state and
through democratic influences will
make it possible for women throughout the country to vote unfettered in
the November elections. The ratification by Tennessee confers universal
suffrage upon twelve states of the
Union, some of which had refused to
ratify the federal amendment.
Republicans in Knoxville too see
advantage for their party in the action of the state.
It will be argued, say leaders, that
without the aid of republicans the
amendment could not have been ratified, and that Senator Harding exerted his influence to get the legislature to act favorably, limiting his
advice only by the constitution of the
state.
 Provision   of   Constitution
No convention or general assembly
of this state shall act upon any amendment of the constitution of the
United States proposed by congress
to the several states, unless such 
convention or general assembly shall
have been elected after such amendment is submitted.
Miss   Sue     S.   White,     Tennessee
state chairman,    National    Woman's
Party   writes   to     Governor   Roberts 
of Tennessee, as follows:
&quot;Since the decision of the supreme 
court of the United tSates(sic.) on June
1st in the case of Hawke vs. Smith,
I have consulted a number of lawyers, including the solicitor general
of the United States, in regard to the
effect that the decision may have
upon the provision of the Tennessee
constitution which attempts to restrict the power of the general assembly to act  upon amendments  of
the   federal   constitution..... Acting
upon these legal opinions, I am, as
chairman of the Tennessee branch of
the National Woman's Party, submitting to you this formal request
that you call the general assembly
of Tennessee into extraordinary session for the purpose of ratifying the
nineteenth amendment to the United
States consitution.
&quot;This request is made with a full
appreciation of every doubt that
could possibly arise as to the validity
of ratification by the present Tennessee general assembly, and after due
consideration of the contingencies
that might result should the doubt be
resolved against the power of the
legislature to act. In support of the
request I am sending copies of opin-
ios(sic.) by Senator Walsh and Governor
Folk. Every one with whom I have
conferred has concurred in these
opinions.</dc:description>

*MRS. L. C. FRENCH       
 GIVES   &quot;SUFFRAGIST&quot; AS HER &quot;AVOCATION.&quot; 

Votes for women?   Certainly. 
Suffragists ?     Certainly 
 again, and also yes, indeed! 
 Knoxville can boast   of   at 
 least one woman who admits 
that  she  is   a suffragist  and  admits it in such a way that 
there can be no doubt of her  pride in the fact. This woman 
is    Mrs.    L.    Crozier French, 
 who has taken such a promi- 
nent part in women's  activities  in  getting  the ballot  in 
 this state and indeed    in the 
nation wide fight for suffrage.
Mrs.    French    even    claims 
herself a suffragist   by   pro- 
fession and her friends  have 
known for some time that she 
 was a suffragist at   least   by 
avocation as her work in this 
 cause has been   characterized 
 by untiring enthusiasm    and 
sound faith in    the   ultimate 
 outcome. 
When     registering,    which 
 Mrs. French made, one of her 
early morning duties on this 
 very  significant    registration 
day   for   Tennessee's   women 
 voters,    she    was  asked  her 
avocation.    Some of the wo- 
men who  had  registered be- 
fore Mrs. French,    and    some 
who   have     registered   since 
have hesitated at that ques- 
tion.   Not so with this pioneer 
leader in the women's   rights 
movement.   She took an add- 
ed grip on her    pen,    smiled 
 with a   determined    curve to 
her lips,  and    wrote    &quot;SUF- 
FRAGIST.&quot;

<dc:description>SUFFRAGE ACT CREATES INTEREST
IN KNOXVILLE POLITICAL CIRCLES
Views Differ as to Effect on
City Election.
Candidates and Friends of Candidates Concerned.
Some Believe Women May Run
For Mayor and Commissioners; Others Say Not.
How many Knoxville women will
qualify for and participate in the
approaching September municipal
primary  and  election?
What will be the effect of the
women's vote in the result of the
primary and  election?
Can a woman become a candidate
for mayor or commissioner under
the equal suffrage law?
These questions are giving some concern to the candidates, prospective candidates, their friends and the politicians
while the public generally is taking more
than usual interest in the coming city
campaign as a result of the recent legislative act granting women the right
to vote in presidential and municipal
elections.
While there is some question as to the
constitutionality of that section of the
act granting the women suffrage in
presidential elections because no provis-
ion is made for separate ballots or ballot
boxes, it now appears that there will
be no attempt to test the measure out
before the Knoxville municipal primary
of September 6 and the following election  of  September  20.
None of the candidates is going to
raise a question as to the constitutionality of the act, as one of them said
Sunday afternoon, because if the statute
should be upheld it might go hard with
the candidate who instituted the proceedings.
How Many Will Vote?
There is a wide difference of opinion
among the politicians and the candidates as to the number of women who
will participate in the. election. Some
believe that unless there is some great
issue in the election, which seems improbable, there will not be a large woman vote.
 One well known politician said Sun-
day that he did not expect more than
1000 women to take part in either the
primary or election.
On the other hand many of the suf-
frage leaders are predicting that the
woman vote will be almost if not equal
to the male vote, and to uphold their
view point out that 5000 women reg-
istered in Chattanooga in one day last
week in order to participate in the
Greater Chattanooga election which will
be  held  early   in  May.
They contend that if such great in-
i terest is manifested in an election where
the only question Is the annexation of
territory to the city that In a Knoxville
city election, when there will probably
be 40 or 50 candidates for mayor and
commissioners, the vote will be much
heavier.
Effect in Doubt.
There is also a great deal of doubt
and difference of opinion among politicians and candidates, as well as their
friends, regarding the effect of the woman vote in the Knoxville election.
Some express the opinion that the result will in all probability be the same
as if ony men  voted.
&quot;Unless there is some unusual cause
 for difference of opinion the men and
women of a family will vote together,&quot;
declared one leader Sunday. &quot;I believe
they will, in most instances, get together, discuss the various candidates and
their qualifications and then vote as a
unit for those agreed upon. However,
there will be many individual exceptions to this rule, and in expressing
this opinion. I do not mean that the husband and father will control the wife's
and daughter's vote, but that they will
consider the matter around the fireside
and reach some conclusion as to their
intentions. Better conditions will probably result from this.&quot;
This view is not shared by others,
however. Some contend that the women
as a whole will be independent voters
and that it is impossible to foresee the
result of their participation in the municipal election this fall.
Qualifications for Office.
Probably the widest difference of opinion regarding the law is as to whether
or not women may become candidates
for mayor and commissioner under its
provisions.
Knoxville attorneys are at variance
on this question, although few have as
yet read the act.
Some declare that the right to vote
carries with it the right to hold office,
while others contend that since the suffrage act limits the right to vote and
withholds full citizenship it does not
grant the privilege of holding office, mu-
[nicipal or otherwise.]
Charles Hays Brown was among the
lawyers interviewed by The Journal and
Tribune Sunday afternoon. He said that
while he had not read the suffrage bill,
he was inclined to the opinion that a
woman could become a candidate and
hold any office for which she has the
right to vote.
Judge Will D. Wright is also of the
opinion that women may run for mayor
and commissioner under the suffrage
act. &quot;I believe the right to vote carries
with it the right to hold office,&quot; said
Judge Wright.
 Hal H. Clements, chairman of the republican state committee, declared that
while he had not read the act carefully
or looked up the provisions of the city
charter, he believed the intention of the
bill and the Intention of the legislators
was to give the women a right both to 
vote and run for office, including president, vice president, elector, mayor and 
commissioner.
Taking an opposite view to those ex- 
pressed are U. S. District Attorney 
Wesley T. Kennerly, Robert D. Taylor 
and other Knoxville lawyers.
&quot;I have read the act only hurriedly 
and have not referred to the provisions 
of the city charter on the subject,&quot; said
General Kennerly. &quot;But my opinion
is that only the right to vote and not
the right to hold office is granted by 
the statute.&quot;
&quot;Not having read the statute, it is
hard to venture an opinion,&quot; declared,
Mr.   Taylor.     &quot;However,     as   I   under-
stand the proposition the law grants
women the right to vote in presidential and municipal elections and does 
not grant them full citizenship with men. 
Therefore, I am inclined to believe that 
they would be ineligible to hold office 
under this act.&quot;
J. Pike Powers, Jr., city attorney; A. 
C. Grimm and General Jameai A. Fow- 
ler said that they had not read the act,
and declined to comment on the mat- 
ter without investigation.
Many Probable  Candidates
While no formal announcements have
been made for city offices, there is a
field   full   of   probable   and   prospective candidates.
Mayor John E. McMillan is under- 
stood to be considering the advisability of seeking re-election and his friends
believe that he will enter the race at 
the proper time.
Commissioner James G. Crumbliss 
and Sam E. Hill have also been men- 
tioned in connection with the mayor's
race, although neither has definitely
made known   his  intention.
Commisioner Crumbliss says that he
&quot;expects to be a candidate,&quot; but it is
understood that, he has not yet determined whether he will enter the lists
for mayor or seek re-election to the
commission.
Former Mayor S. G. Heiskell has also
been repeatedly mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor, but so far
as known has not intimated any intention  to run.
Another possible, if not a probable,
candidate for mayor is E. W. Neal, business man and chairman of the Knox
county republican executive committee.
Col. Gary F. Spence, commander of
the famous 117th Infantry throughout
the world war and who ran a strong
race four years ago, has also been boosted for mayor by his friends.
List For Commisioner
Following is as near complete list of
probable and possible candidates for
commissioner, including those who have
merely been mentioned by their friends,
as it has been possible to compile. The
names appear in alphabetical order—no
man can take offense because his name
begins with &quot;Z&quot; instead of &quot;A&quot;.
Dr. A. D. Albright, business man and
member of the city board of education.
Hal H. Clements, chairman of the republican state executive cornmitee and
attorney for the Central Labor union,   
Creed F. Copeland, insurance man and 
recently a Y. M. C. A. secretary in 
France.
S. H. Cottrell, justice of the peace 
from the third district. 
James G. Crumbliss, commisioner of 
parks and public property.
Frank Dobson, justice of the peace 
from the city-at-large.
Major Charles W. Dyer, recently of 
the American expeditionary forces in 
France
Captain Ambrose Gaines, recently of 
the American expeditionary forces in
France.
Colonel James A. Gleason, recently of 
the American expeditionary forces in 
France.
Lynn A. Hayes, business man and 
former  county  trustee.
Mitchell E. Henry, business man of 
South Knoxville.
Sam E. Hill, commissioner of accounts 
and finance.
John A. Jones, deputy United States 
marshal. 
Fred W. Keith, member of the board 
of education and former president of
the Central Labor union.
I. C. King, real estate man and form- 
er county register.</dc:description>

<dc:description>LEAGUE WOMEN VOTERS DECIDES
COURSE IN CITY ELECTION AT
MEETING THURSDAY AFTERNOON
Whether to Support Woman for City
Council As a Body or Play &quot;Hands
Off&quot; May Split Organization.
Will the members of the Knox
county League of Women Voters decide, as an organization, to work for
women candidates in the coming city
election, regardless of the ticket represented, or will the organization refuse to declare for women?
This is the question to be decided
at the meeting of the league to be
held at the Health Center, Thursday
afternoon at 3 o'clock. The action taken by the organization on the woman
question, will also decide whether or
not a number of the members will
continue with the league or will withdraw, to form a new organization for
the support of the woman's cause, according to Mrs. L. C. French, who,
with supporters who are indignant
over the league's failure to demand
that a woman be nominated for coun-
cilman-at-large, will bring up the
question and call for a vote on this
matter. 
The opinion of certain league members seems to vary in regard to
what the policy of the League of Wo-
man Voters with reference to the
woman's cause should be, some stating that the purpose of the organization is merely, as stated in article
two, of the by laws of the national
constitution, to foster education in
citizenship, and support needed legislation. Those taking this view quote
this paragraph from the statement of
the purpose, program and organization of the National League of Women Voters.
Not &quot;Woman's Party&quot;
&quot;It is not a woman's party; it is
a civic organization whose work is
supplementary to the parties and it
urges every woman to enroll in the
party of her choice.&quot;
In explaining their position that
the league should not endorse, as a
body, specific candidates, those of
this opinion also quote this paragraph taken from the same document
as previously quoted:
&quot;It (The League of Women Voters)
instructs women in all the machinery of elections, but does not tell
them for whom  to vote.&quot;
Mrs. Wm. L. Morris, president of
the league, is one of those who take
the view that the purpose of the
league is educational and that it does
not favor a woman's party.
Mrs. French, and a number of supporters, take a different view of the
purpose of the league. They believe
that the League of Women Voters
which was organized to take the
place  of  the  old  suffrage  party,   is,
while, not strictly a woman's party,
yet an organization, not only for educating women in citizenship, but for
placing women in office in national,
state and local government, where
their viewpoint and influence will
accomplish much for their country,
state or community.
Point to   Preamble
In support of this theory, its adherents bring forward this statement
contained in the outline of the policy
of the National League of Women
Voters, which follows the statement
above quoted, that the league is not
a woman's party:
&quot;It is an organization of women
working for women—not because women have a separate stake in government, but because their simultaneous
enfranchisement has made them a
group with a collective need for education and experience; and because
they can bring a characteristic woman's viewpoint to the solution of the
nation's problems.&quot;
Also from the report of the third
annual convention of the Tennessee
League of Women Voters, held in
Nashville, last January, in a statement of the beliefs and purposes of
the league, following the endorsement
of the state and national by laws,
those who believe the league should
support women for office, quote the
following:
Women for Office
&quot;The league believes that qualified
women in administrative office, upon
boards and commissions and legislative bodies, will contribute a necessary point of view to the government
in the United States, and to its international relations. The league,
therefore, urges the election and appointment of qualified women in positions in national, state and local
government.&quot;
The controversy between the supporters of the two conflicting views,
with reference to the purpose of the
League of Woman Voters, will most
likely be a spirited one and will probably occupy the greater part of the
time devoted to business.
Following the business meeting, an
address by Manager E. N. Farris, of
the Board of Commerce on &quot;What
a Real Public Health Department
Should Be,&quot; and a talk by Miss
Louise Bignall of the Associated
Charities, on the mothers' pension
bill will be heard by the members of
the league. The program for Thursday was arranged by the civics department, of which Miss Jean Crawford is chairman.</dc:description>

WANT TO REACH
GOAL OF 8,000
Women Prepare For Supplemental Registration.
League    Will    Hold    Meeting
Thursday Afternoon—Mrs.
Miller Makes an Appeal.
******************
* *
* WOMEN  ARE  CALLED *
*  *
* Mrs. Thomas    Peacock    Miller, *
* chairman of the Non-Partisan polit- 
* ical league, has called a meeting *
 * of all ward chairmen and mem- *
 * bers of the league to take place at *
 * Board of Commerce rooms Thurs- *
 * day afternoon at 4 o'clock. Plans *
 * for the supplemental registration *
 * will be discussed. They will also *
 * explain in detail &quot;how to vote.&quot; *
 * A full attendence is requested.        *
* *
******************
&quot;Let's all pull together, for many
things will come up in the next two
years and we will all want a voice in
it,&quot; says Mrs. Thomas Peacock Miller,
chairman   of  the   Non-Partisan  league
&quot;Thursday, Friday and Saturday are
the days set aside for the supplemental
registration and I do hope Knoxville
women will go way over the top and
make at the very least an 8,000 registration,&quot;  Mrs.  Miller  says.
&quot;Many women who have been out of
the city have phoned me regarding this
registration. In the supplemental registration one cannot vote in the primary but one can vote in the general
election and I want all the women who
were undecided and all the women
whose husbands objected to them registering to put on  their thinking caps
and their persuasive caps and take advantage of their opportunity to register
in this supplemental registration. Think
of the power and the opportunity of
the 6,831 who have prepared to exercise their franchise! Personally I really
do not see how anybody can hang back.
It seems to me all the women would
really have the interest of their town
so in mind and in heart that they would
feel compelled to raise their voices for
the advancement of the principles for
which women stand.
&quot;Let's all pull together—for many
things will come up in the next two
 years—and we will all want a voice in
 it. It's your city and it's mine—and
now that the legislature and the supreme court have put this responsibil-
itiy upon us whether we ever craved
the responsibility or not, it is here, and
it has given the women a wonderful
power and we want to use it wisely and
well. I have spoken before of the excellent work of the ward chairmen in
the splendid registration of women in
Knoxville.
&quot;There are two other groups to whom
a great deal of credit of the registration is largely due. The nurses of
Knoxville and the central federation of
labor. The nurses, many of whom belong to the Non-Partisan league, have
been so busy with their profession that,
it was impossible for them to attend
meetings but have been so wonderfully enthusiastic that in the homes where
they were nursing they have been able
to convert many, many women and really make them see their responsibility.
It is surprising how many women
have been able to see the light through
the eyes of the trained nurses of Knoxville.
&quot;The Central Labor union pledged its
support to the Non-Partisan ieague in
promising to do all it coaid to see that
the wives, mothers, sisters, daughters
and sweethearts registered. It has kept
its pledges, for many interesting tales
are told by the men in urging reluctant
women to register. The women in the
fai(missing)es of labor have measured up exceedingly well and we feel it is due to
the men.
&quot;Just let me repeat, let's all pull together for an 8,000 registration for
Knoxville women. We can do it Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week.
It's an easy thing to do and in the
coming two years let no woman say, 'Oh,
I wish I had registered. I can't vote
or do a thing about this, that or the
other.' Let there be no regrets. Do
your civic duty and register without
fail.&quot;</dc:description>

No Women Mentioned
So far no women have been mentioned as probable candidates for either
mayor or commisioner, although it is
believed that some may enter the race
in the event the law is construed, after careful investigation, to grant them
the  privilege of holding office.
While Mayor McMillan and Commissioner Crumbiss and Hill are regarded as possible candidates for mayor and
the latter two as possible candidates
for commissioner in the event they do 
not seek the mayorship, the other two 
members of the commission, John W. 
Flenniken. of the street department, and
N. T. Little, of the department of pub- 
lic safety, have stated definitely that
they will not be candidates at the ap-
proaching election.
In the opinion of Knoxville politicians the number of entries in the nonpartisan primary will be as high as 40
or 50.
Two candidates for mayor and eight
for commissioner will be nominated in
the primary Sept. 6 and the voters will 
choose between these at the regular elec- 
tion Sept. 20.

<dc:description>If the predictions in this ward are true
then there will have to be on an average
of 100 votes polled every minute, or
one every thirty-six seconds, and accord-
ing to these figures the booths will be
crowded every minute of the day.
In the fourteenth ward, Park City,
more than 1,000 persons have registered
and the same thing will be true as to
the voting on election day as in the eleventh ward.
Roy H. Beeler, chairman of the commissioners of election, says that he has
already urged several of the leaders in
the women's non-partisan league to
bring this matter before the members,
in order to assure everybody a vote.
Additional booths will be placed in
the larger wards of the city by the commissioners of election and all preparations will be made to accommodate the
vast crowd on the day of the contest.
In making out the list of election officers, the commissioners took into consideration the fact that the vote will
be exceedingly heavy, and men were
appointed as clerks who could quickly
enter the names of those voting and
who could count the ballots at a rapid
rate.
Mr. Beeler says he hopes the public
in general will bear in mind these facts
and assist the commission and those
who have been appointed to hold the
election as far as possible.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Come On, Tennessee!

Percival Clement,   governor  of  Vermont,   refuses to call a special
session of the Legislature to consider the woman suffrage amendment.
The governor of Connecticut is equally obstinate.
Louisiana and Delaware have locked the door against the women.
Carolina does not answer the door-bell.    Suffragists now
turn to Tennessee to break the deadlock and complete ratification.
If Tennessee fails, it probably means that the amendment cannot
be ratified in time for all women to vote for president.
Indications are that Tennessee will not fail.   Governor Roberts
has promised to comply with President Wilson's request for a
special suffrage session of the Legislature.   Candidate Cox assures
the National Woman's party that he will do all in his power to bring
about ratification by Tennessee.
The state constitution of Tennessee says that an election must
intervene between congressional approval of an amendment and
action by the state Legislature. This is to let voters
pass on the amendment at the polls. But this obstruction apparently
was swept aside by the recent ruling of the United States
Supreme Court in the Ohio prohibition case, that state
laws are invalid when they conflict with the amendment machinery
provided by the national constitution.
Suffragists have polled the 132 members of the Tennessee
Legislature and have lined up 45 pledged votes for suffrage.
Only 22 more votes are needed to win the long fight. Whether,
millions of women will vote for president this year now rests in
the hands of 22 men. For those 22 to block suffrage would be rank 
political folly. It would be ridiculous defiance of a great national
sentiment that has swept the country.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Must Register From Aug. 10-21.  Estimated by Roy A. Beeler
That From 5,000 to 7,500
Women Will Qualify      
IN CITY AND COUNTY
Election Commission Selects
Registrars at Meeting Next 
Wednesday
The selection of registrars to serve
in the general Knox county registration, which is to be conducted from
Aug. 10 to 21, is to be taken up by the
Knox county election commission at
a meeting to be held next Wednesday.
The commission will have to provide
for the registration of the women as
well as for the men, and it is estimated by Roy A. Beeler, chairman of
the committee, that from 5,000 to 7,500
women may register.
The same books will be used for
both women and men, Mr. Beeler
states.
It is expected that about 15,000 men
will register, Mr. Beeler asserts.
About 10,000 or 12,000 of these are
men residing within the twenty-six
wards of Greater Knoxville.
While the women will be allowed
to vote only in city and presidential
elections, they will be asked to register in the county precincts, as this is
a general registration, and will serve
for the next presidential election,
which will be held in 1920.
The election commission, which is
composed of Mr. Beeler, as chairman,
W. L. Warters, secretary, and C. C.
Hood, will have to select 136 registrars, two to serve at each of the
sixty-eight precincts of the city and
county. Thirty-one of these precincts
are in the city, there being twenty-six
wards, five of which have two separate voting places.
Mr. Beeler states that he is of the
opinion that women can not be legally appointed as registrars in this registration, as the registration is also to
qualify voters for state and county
elections, in which the women can not
vote. He states that if it was for a
city election only, the women might
be appointed as registrars.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN SLOW
IN REGISTERING
Men Outnumber Them Three to
One First Day.
Expect   Proportion  to   Change
Materially   in  Next  Few
Days—Some Figures.
The number of women registrants on
the opening day of the biennial registration here yesterday was somewhat
smaller than was expected, the ratio
being about three men to one woman in
a number of wards where reports were
received shortly before the closing hour.
Reports received from a number of
wards early in the day indicated that
the women in every section of the city
were showing a disinclination to rush to
the booths to qualify for the municipal
elections, but political leaders last night
attributed this failing to their inexperience in politics, and expressed the belief that the number of women registrants in the next few days would be
nearly as large as the number of males.
In the first ward there were 54 receipts issued up to 7 o'clock, of which
19 were issued to women. In the south
ninth, only four women had registered
up to 7 o'clock, while receipts were issued to 58 men. At the Park City fire
hall in the 14th ward, 69 receipts were
issued, 20 of them being made out for
women.
In the second ward, 48 had registered
up to 7 o'clock. Eleven of these receipts were issued to women. Fifty-five
were qualified in the 6th ward, 14 of
them being women.
While these figures are incomplete,
they nevertheless furnish an idea of
how the first day's registrations were
being recorded among both the men and
women voters of KnoxviUe, clearly-
showing that in every section of the
city there was but little activity among
the women in obtaining registration receipts to qualify for the municipal elections.  
Mrs. T. P. Miller, president of the
Non-Partisan Political league, said last
night that while the initial day's registration among the women voters was
lighter than expected, she believed that
a heavy registration would be recorded
before the end of the week.
&quot;We hope to register at least 50 per
cent of the eligible women voters,&quot; said
Mrs. Miller, &quot;before the expiration of
the time limit, Aug. 21.&quot;
Mrs. Miller registered in the 14th
ward at noon.
Mrs. R. L. Cunningham, who has
charge of the work of organizing women's
 clubs in the city wards, was busy
lst night sending out literature, explaining certain election details. Mrs.
Cunningham is actively engaged in the
work of bringing out women to the registration precincts.
Mrs. Henry Welcker, a native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, was the first
woman to register in the twenty-sixth
ward, South Knoxville, Monday morning. Mrs. Welcker says she was an
anti-suffragette, but since the law giving the women the right to cast their
ballots  in  city   elections she  believes  it (missing)</dc:description>

<dc:description>VOTE EARLY AND
AVOID THE RUSH
Election Commission Starts Educational Campaign.
In West   Eleventh   Ward  One
Vote Must Be Cast Every
36 Seconds,
&quot;Vote   Early!&quot;
This is the slogan which the commissioners of election will urge the women,
who intend to participate in the coming
primary city election, to adopt in order
to avoid the rush at certain hours on
election day and to assure a vote for
all who are registered.
It is now an assured fact that the
coming primary election will be the
largest ever held in this county or
even in this section of the state, as the
registration books reveal the fact that
19,302 men and women have qualified
themselves to participate in the political contest. However, it is expected that
there will not be as many persons cast
their votes as have registered.
The commissioners of election say
that in many of the largest wards it will
be absolutely necessary for the women
to vote in the morning and early afternoon in order that the men may vote
after their work hours. In all the elec-
tions that have been held in this city
or county, more than one-half of the
votes are cast after four o'clock in the
afternoon, due to the fact that the majority of the men voters are compelled
to cast their vote after work  hours.
It is also cited by the members of
the election commission that this move
would not only be to the interest of the
men voters, but will greatly assist the
women, in that if they cast their votes
in the morning and early afternoon the
polls will not be so crowded as during
the noon hour and after four o'clock.</dc:description>

<dc:description>'CHAIN' BY SUFFRAGISTS.
1,000 Are to Circle White House
and End Picketing Today.
DROP  THE   JERICHO   FEATURE
Ram's Horns Will Not Be Blown During Big Demonstration, Leaders Believing Tactics Out of Place in the
 Present Crisis—Union and Wom-
an's Party Combine.
 Encircling the  White House with a
chain of purple, white and gold, women suffragists will bring to a climax at
 3   p.   m.   today   in   a   two-hour   silent
demonstration  their siege  of  President
Wilson on behalf of a Federal suffrage
amendment.    About a thousand women,
members   of   the   Congressional   Union
for  Woman  Suffrage and  the National
Women's Party, have   enlisted to lengthen for the final watch the line of pickets on guard at the White House gates
for   the   last   six   weeks,   encompassing
the  President's comings and goings to
impress   him   in   the   last   days   of   his
first  term   with  their determination  to
have the ballot.
Not Exactly Like Jericho.
Only in a modified form, however,
will the demonstration follow plans
that had been laid to reproduce the
march of the Israelites around Jericho.
At first it was proposed to circle the
White House seven times, with seven
priests carrying the suffrage ark, and
accompanied by &quot;a long blast of the
ram's horn,&quot; the citadel signifying to
suffragists the stronghold of opposition
to the cause of suffrage by Federal
amendment.
Why   that   method    of   attack    was
abandoned has not been made entirely
clear by the women's leaders, some of
them explaining that the  critical international situation  would  make  such a
demonstration   appear   as   bad   tactics,
and others hinting that some  of those
in the suffrage ranks thought it might
 seem to border on the sacriligious.
Outwardly, at least, the President has shown no sign of wavering in his oppo-
sition to a Federal amendment and his
jpreference for suffrage by State enact-
ment.
Won Only Wilson's Smiles.
Daily  he  has   smiled   and   saluted   at
the pickets always encountered, rain or
shine,   when   the   presidential   car   has
left    or    entered    the    White    House grounds.
 During the first days of the siege,
 when bitter January winds tried the
 courage of the guards, he sent them an
 invitation to come inside. But it was
 not accepted, and since then, except for
jthe daily smile and salute, he has not
jshown that he was aware of his state of siege.
Today's demonstration, the most re-
markable perhaps of all those that have
 characterized the fight for equal suf-
frage, will be timed to begin three
 hours after the official beginning of the
new presidential term.</dc:description>

<dc:description>SHIELDS AND
FISHER ANSWER
Reply to  Resolutions  of  the
Woman's Party of Tennessee.
Memphis     Congressman     Will
Vote For Full Citizenship of
American Women.
The     Knox   County     committee    of   the
 Woman's Party on March 28, passed resolutions which were sent to the President and
 all  members   of  congress  from   Tennessee.
iCongressman  Austin's   reply   was  publish-
ed several days ago, and those of Senator
Shields    and    Representative   Fisher,   now
appearing,  will  be of interest to the public
generally,   but  more especially  to  suffragists.    The resolutions are as follows:—
&quot;Whereas the international situation is in
such  a  disturbed  condition  that  none  can
 predict  what a day may  bring forth, and
 it is not improbable that war may shortly
be declared between the United States and
Germany;
Thererefore be it resolved that it is the
(missing)se of this meeting that because in the
(missing) of war the women of this country
equally with the men will be called upon
to carry their share of the burdens thereof,
that now is the time for congres to take the
first step toward the recognition by the
government of this republic of the citizenship of women by the passage of the federal amendment looking to the removal of
the political disabilities of the women of
the whole Union.
&quot;The patriotism of the women of tne
United States is assured, but the pleasure
of their patriotic acts will be greatly enhanced by the knowledge that the government recognizes their right to full citizen-
'ship.
&quot;We most earnestly petition the President and congress to do all in their power
to obtain justice for women before calling
upon them to perform extra duties. Be it
further resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be sent to the President and all
Tennessee congressmen.
Senator Shields' Letter.
Washington,  D.   C.
April 7.
Mrs.  L. Crozier-French,
Knoxville,   Tennnessee.
My Dear Mrs.  French:
I have your letter and a copy of resolutions adopted by the Tennessee Woman's
party and I am very glad to have an expression  of  your  views.
I am sending you a copy of the last edition of the Congressional Directory, and
shall be glad to supply you with any other
documents which might be of interest to
you.
With kindest regards, I am,
Very   truly   yours,
[JOHN] K.  SHIELDS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>CONGRESSIONAL UNION STATE
BRANCH IS ORGANIZED HERE
What It Means.
The formation of a Tennessee branch
of the Congressional Union for woman
suffrage was the object of Miss Paul's
visit to the state. , This makes the twenty-seventh state 'branch of the union
formed, and,  as Miss Paul explained in
her talk, these various state branches
are being organized so that they may
help the Congressional union in its work
at Washington in having the federal
amendment to the constitution enfranchising women passed.
As is generally known, the object of
the union is to bring pressure to bear
upon congress to pass the Susan B. Anthony amendment to the federal constitution, which provides for the granting
of suffrage to the women of the nation.
The work of the union is concentrated
at Washington on the senators and rep-
resentatives, and the policy of the union
is against separate state campaigns.  The members of the union believe that the quickest way to obtain suffrage is through the &quot;State's rights&quot; principle.

 The main work of the separate state
 branches of the union to work on the sen-
ators and representatives of their various
states  who  are  opposed  to  the  passage
 of the federal amendment enfranchising
 women, and to do all in their power to
either  convert them  to the cause  or
defeat them  for re-election  to  the  next
congress.
Colors of the Union.
The banquet hall on the fourth
floor of the Imperial hotel was decorated for the occasion with flags and
streamers of purple, white and gold,
the official colors of the Congressional
union.
The banqueters were seated at
small tables, and the room was entirely filled. Hardly another table
could have been placed. The assemblage was a brilliant one, representative of the culture and an intellect
of the city.
Among the out-of-town women
present were Mrs. Hugh Lawson
White, of Johnson City; Mrs. J. N.
Houser, of Mascot, Mrs. K. P. Jones,
of Maryville; Mrs. J. E. Brading, of
Johnson City; Miss Ernestine Noa, of
Chattanooga, and Miss Nancy Lea
Broady, of Maryville.
Upon motion of Mrs. French, it
was decided to send a telegram to
Senator John K. Shields, at Washington, who is known to oppose the
passage of the federal amendment
enfranchising women, asking him, in
the name of the 160 persons at the
gathering, to re-consider his position
on this question, and vote for the
amendment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN TO SERVE IN ELECTIONS
Two   are   Among   Appointments for Constitutional Convention Election
OFFICERS CHOSEN
For   All Except Two   Wards
and Twenty-Four County
Precincts
 For the first time In Knoxville's
history women have been appointed
to serve as election officers. They
will assist in holding the constitutional   convention   election   Septem-    
ber     4.      Miss     Willie     Cleage   has   been appointed a clerk of the election in the second ward and Mrs. J.M. Munlyn has been appointed a registrar in the fifteenth ward.  Both these women have taken an active part in the interest of women's participation in the campaign and elections.  Several women are serving as registrars, in recognition of the recently  conferred    privilege  of    suffrage and its vindication in the courts and the appointment of women among the election   officials   marks   the   official entrance of women in municipal politics and government in Knoxville.      The appointment of election officialis in all except two wards, the sixth and seventh, was announced 
this morning by members of the Knox  
county election commission. The appolntment of the officers in several

<dc:description>November 16, 1924
WOMEN OFFICEHOLDERS HAVE MADE BIG GAINS

Two Governors, 88 State Legislators, One Representative in Congress and a Secretary of State Successful at Polls – Old Parties Chary of Support

	Since the tumult and shouting of the recent elections have died, people are beginning to realize what an important part women had played in the drama; not only in voting and campaigning, but also in winning elective office.  Two women have won Governorships, at least eighty-eight women have been returned to the State Legislatures of the nation and one to Congress, while another was elected a Secretary of State.  To be sure, a great many of these who ran for office did not win-but there is significance in the fact that so many were nominated, and that here and there they did win.  In twenty-two of these United States women entered the competition for State offices.  In eleven, women were nominated for Congress.  This much has been accomplished within a brief four years toward recognizing the capabilities of the former stay-at-homes.  What does the future hold?  And what has this year’s history-making meant to the women of the country as a whole?
	First of all, the results which are known should be set down at this time.  Complete returns are not yet available.  Mrs. Miriam Ferguson was elected Governor of Texas, Mrs. Nellie Taylor Ross Governor of Wyoming.  They are both Democrats.  Mrs. Florence E. S. Knapp, Republican, has been elected Secretary of State of New York, and Mrs. Mary T. Norton of New Jersey will take her seat in Congress as the first woman Democratic Representative.  These four places are of nation-wide interest.  The first two have achieved a unique position for women, but there have been four women who have served in Congress-Miss Rankin, Miss Robertson, Mrs. Huck and Mrs. Nolan-and there have been two other women Secretaries of State-Mrs. Cromwell of Kentucky and Mrs. Soledad Chacon of New Mexico.  
	The story of Mrs. Ferguson’s triumph was expected and is too well known to be retold.  Mrs. Ross, on the other hand, had so little publicity before election that her success came as quite a surprise outside the State.  Her husband, former Governor William Ross, died suddenly in October, and the voters of her state insisted that she take his place and carry on his plans.  She rolled…a huge majority at the polls.  It happens that the two women Governor have gone in as if by a side door, because of untoward happenings to their husbands.  Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Knapp, however, went in on their own through regular channels and as a result of years of work and familiarity with matters political.  But no one seems to feel that the first two will be any less valuable to their constituencies.
	Next in importance come those who have been elected to their State Legislatures.  According to The Woman Citizen, the following have won successes at the polls:
	California-Cora M. Woodbridge, Anne L. Saylor, Este B. Broughton, Grace S. Dorris and Eleanor Miller.
	Connecticut-Marjorie Cheney, Hannah D. Townshend, Corinne R. Alsop, Elizabeth W. Coe, Mary M. Hooper, Julia Emery, Sarah B. Crawford, Mary B. Weaver, Helen A. Green, Edith Raymond, Edna C. Fenniman, Clarissa Nevins, Ethel M. Ryan, Helen E. Kewis and Annie E. Vinton.
	Delaware-Florence M. Hanby.
	Illinois-Mrs. Lottie Holman O’Neill, Mrs. Katherine Hancock Goode, Mrs. Rena Elrod and Mrs. Florence Fifer Bohrer.
	Indiana (incomplete)-Antoinette C. Hagenwald and Mrs. Edward Franklin White.
	Kansas-Mrs. R. H. Trueblood and Mrs.Ben Mickel.
	Maine-Mrs. Katherine C. Allen.
	Massachusetts-M. Sylvia Donaldson and Mrs. Harriet Russell Hart.
	Minnesota-Mabeth Hurd Paige and Mrs. Hannah Kempfer.
	Nebraska-Mrs. Clare C. Humphrey, Sarah P. Muir and Mabel A. Gillespie.
	Nevada-Daisy Allen, Florence Shazey and Mayme Schwebble.

Eleven Elected in New Hampshire

	New Hampshire-Dr. Zatac Straw, Mrs. Arnold S. Yantis, Mrs. Hobart Pillsbury, Mrs. Mary Chapman, Mrs. Imogene B. Emmons, Mrs. Maca S. Hilton, Mrs. Nellie J. Page, Margaret H. Barden, Jennie Fortier, Victoria Langlois, Helen J. Young.
	New Jersey-Mae Carty, Mrs. C. Finn, Mary A. Thorpp, Mrs. Lila Thompson, Madge I. Ebert.
	New York-Mrs. Rhoda Fox Graves.
	North Carolina-Mrs. Julia Alexander, Mrs. Giles Cover.
	Ohio- (incomplete)-Mrs. Nettie B. Loughead, Mrs. Maude C. Waitt, Grace E. Makepeace, Nettie M. Clapp, Mrs. Clara Wood Derr, Mrs. Viola D. Romans, Mrs. May D. Van Wye, Mrs. Florence H. Wells, Mrs. C. J. Ott, Osa Denny.
	Pennsylvania-Mrs. Flora M. Vare (to Senate), Lillie H. Pitts, Martha G. Thomas, Helen Grimes, Alice M. Bentley, Martha M. Pennok, Maude B. Trescher.
	South Dakota (incomplete-Mrs. Mabel Moody, Gladys Pyle, Celia M. Kelley, Christine Olson.
	Utah-Mrs. N. A. Dunyon, Mrs. Julia Smart, Mrs. Arthur E. Graham, Mrs. Munroe Paxman.
	Washington-Mrs. Belle Reeves, Mrs. Harry John Miller, Mrs. Maude Swe?man.
	West Virginia-Dr. Harriette Jones.
	This list is impressive since it shows how much the old attitude of antagonism is dying out, and because it tells where women will be working for one another in the seats of government.  
	And herein lies a curious bit of psychology.
	Women generally do not support women.  Those who have handled campaigns make that statement universally, and some of them deplore it. At headquarters for the Woman’s Party, for example, Mrs. Clarence M. Smith, state Chairman, said:
	“We never advocate that people should vote for a woman simply because she is a woman, but we do wish that they would get over the idea that women are not as capable as men.  If voters would only give them the benefit of the doubt and look into qualifications, a great many more women would hold office.  There are women in every branch of professional and business life who are known to be eminently successful, yet the general feeling is that an elective job is too big for them to handle. 
	“The major parties seldom nominate a woman, because they don’t feel that the policy is one to inspire the confidence of their voters.  Socialist, Prohibition, Farmer-Labor-all the small parties list them but those parties seldom win.”
	“Do you think it is a wise move for the women who seek office to become identified in the public mind with the less conservative groups?”  Mrs. Smith was asked.
	“The public mind is very slow to identify anything, and I think it is better to use that means as an opening wedge than to do nothing at all.  Public opinion has changed a great deal since the days of Mrs. Pankhurst, but it has had to be very gradual.”
	…Vice President of…Council of the Women’s…not think that the recent elections indicate any improvement on the part of the attitude of women generally.

Women Don’t Interest Women

	“Those who were elected were put in by the man’s votes, and will administer their offices as nearly in accordance with party policies and political expediencies as men would do in the same position.  They are not particularly aware of nor interested in improving the condition of women by means of legislation for equal rights.  The vast majority of busy housewives are not yet awake to their responsibilities for helping less fortunate women.  They are not yet really interested in using the power which the ballot gives them.  It will take time-great movements always do.”
	“What do you think of the likelihood of a woman for President?”
	“I think it is quite probable, at some future date.  Why not?  Women have governed well as queens and empresses-it wouldn’t b too big a job by any means.”
	That same question was put to at least tenpersons, both men and women, and after the first surprised minute of thinking they nearly all answered to that effect.  And one man added:  “What would we have said last year to the proposition of women for Governors?  One had better be mighty wary now about saying what could not happen.”
In studying the official lists of nominations it becomes evident that the Democrats and Republicans name a woman under only two conditions:  One: when there is absolutely no chance for her to win; and the other, when there is no chance for her to lose, as shown by the party solidarity behind Mrs. Norton, for instance.  While it must be admitted that it is pretty good party policy, progressive women think it hard that the powers that be do not give women a chance to put up a good fight on their own account.  They believe, however, that that may come in due time.  One factor in the situation is that the qualifications demanded of a woman office seeker are infinitely more exacting than those demanded of a man.  A woman is required to be a person of social standing, of excellent education, of personal charm, of wealth, and with ability to make good speeches.  A moment’s reflection shows how much higher that standard is than the one which men candidates are measured by, for whom every possible assistance is furnished by an eager party machine.

Have Lost in England.

	In contrast to the situation in this country, England’s women have lost badly.  Out of forty-one candidates only four were elected, largely because of the shifting of power from Labor to Conservative.  It is rumored that the Duchess of Atholl will be appointed to the new Cabinet, but the great favorite, Lady Astor, has had to step into second place.  There are those who mourn Lady Astor’s residence in England, feeling that her own country lost a great stateswoman when Nancy Langhorne of…

<dc:description>Ramifications of System Will
Extend Down to &quot;Block
Chairmen&quot; With  Assistants
The discussion of further plans
for   the   organization   of   the   six
districts of the city for the coming election of councilmen  under
the   city   manager   form   of   government, took place at the meeting   of   the   League   of   Women
Vters this afternoon at the Woman's     building.     Mrs.     W.     L.
Morris,   president,   presided   and
the   program   was   in   charge   of
Mrs. J. Marion  Miller.
At a previous meeting of the league
the president appointed six chairmen
to perfect an organization of the women  in   their   districts.   Each  chairman was to appoint a vice-chairman
to assist in the district organization.
In   making   the     appointments,     the
president   was   careful   to   alternate
with  republicans  and  democrats,   so
that  there  would   not  be   any  party
feeling  to  possibly   mar  the  organization.
Appointments made thus far are:
First   district—Mrs.    R.    L.    Cunningham,   democrat,   chairman.      No
vice-chairman has yet been announced.
Second district—Miss Kate White,
democrat, chairman. No vice-chairman has yet been announced.</dc:description>

<dc:description>LAST RUSH
OF VOTERS
Four Thousand Five Hundred
Make Ready for Primary.
TOTAL OF 2,595 WOMEN
SECURE CERTIFICATES
New   Record   Set   During  Three-Day
Supplemental   Registration — Colored   Women   Registered   Number   644—1,951   White
Women.
At the close of the three day's supplemental registration on account of the city primary election of June 10, it was 
found that all records of a supplemental
had been smashed. The rush of voters,
both men and women, continued until the
limitation of the law closed the books.
The total registration reported to The
Times by the officials of the registration
was 4,318. The Tenth ward registrars
were too tired or something. They failed
to make a report again, as they did on
Tuesday night. From an outside authority it was learned that the total registration in that ward was 225, which runs
the aggregate in all wards and precincts
and of all races and sexes to  4,543.
It is impossible to separate the Tenth
ward registration into sexes or races, but
the remainder of the city was very obligingly turned in by the registrars in detail, notwithstanding they all had a
strenuous day, with the heaviest work
during  the closing  hours.
Excluding the Tenth ward, the figures
of  the  registration   may   be analyzed:
The final day's registration brought in
1.042 white women and 457 negro
women. White men registered numbered
589 and negro men 300. The final day's
registration   is   shown   in   the   following table:
Last   Day. (Lists White &amp; Colored Males &amp; Females by Wards).
Totals     589      1,042       300      457
In the total registration for the three
days it develops that 1,240 white women
qualified as legal voters under the new
suffrage law and 644 negro women. The
total female vote, therefore, that has
qualified   by   registration   is   2.595.
Following table sets out the registration by precints in detail.

offered  the  law  as   his  profession,

*******'*********
Complete and   final figures
received by
The Journal and Tribune from
all of the 31  registration precincts in the city
 after the general registration was brought to a 
close   last   night   show   that   the
number
of certificates issued during the ten
 days' registration  was  19.,02.
Certificates  were issued  to
12, 471 men,
while   the  number   of   women
totaled   6,831.     About   200   absentees were registered.
By   these  figures   it   is   shown
that   ap-
proximately a    third    of the
registrants are  women.     One   of  the  features of the registration
 was   the   interest manifested
by  the  women  in   almost   every ward
of the city.
 Last night the  registration officials found it difficult to handle the large number of
 of men  and women who appeared at
the   registration   precincts   shortly before the closing hour/

<dc:description>RECOGNITION OF WOMEN IN THE
APPROACHING CITY ELECTION IS
OBJECTIVE OF VOTERS' LEAGUE

The qualifications that candidates
for councilmen under the city manager form of government should have,
and recommendations for candidates,
'&quot;will be the principal discussion at
the next meeting of the League of
Women Voters, Thursday, June 21.
This was decided at a meeting held
yesterday afternoon at the woman's
building, after it was suggested that
the league get down to specific work.
A committee was also appointed to
prepare a questionnaire which will
be sent to all candidates when they
are announced. This committee, will
meet Saturday morning and will be
composed of the chairmen and vice-
chairmen of each district, the offi-
cers of the league and the following
ladies also: Mrs. H. M. Wilson, Mrs.
T. A. Wright, Mrs. Lucy Reed, Mrs.
Lonas.
This committee will work out a
program whereby the league can use
its influence immediately with the
nominating committee in the selection of the candidates for councilmen.
It was suggested that the questionnaire to be sent out should seek to
find out if the candidates are trained
for the position they will hold, if
they are in favor of law enforcement,
and if they are connected with any
corporation having financial deal-
ings with the city.
Want Women  Named
It was intimated at the meeting
that the league would insist that
women be named as candidates as
well as men, and that a fight will be
made to have women on the school 
board.
&quot;If we do not ask for a woman, or 
women, we have no right to exist 
as a league of women voters,&quot; said ,
Mrs. W. L. Morris, president of the 
league.
An advisory council of six men to 
consult with the league at any time
a consultation may be necessary, was
voted upon after the names had been
presented by a committee previously
appointed for the purpose of selecting an advisory council. They were: J.
. Jones, T. A. Wright and J. Donaldson, republicans; Weston Fulton,
Fred Ault and John Ayres, democrats.
This committee also selected Mrs.
Fred A. Ault as head of the department of public health in the League
of Women Voters; Mrs. E. L. Thomas,
head of children's department; and
Mrs. L. C. French, head of the wom- 
en's department. The duties of these
women will be to work for any laws 
concerning their department. A 
leader for the civics department will 
be chosen later.
First district—Mrs. R. L. Cunningham, chairman; Mrs. Will Gilbert,
vice-chairman.
Second district—Miss Kate White,
chairman; Mrs. J. L. Watson, vice-
chairman.
Third district—Mrs. S. A. King,
chairman; Mrs. Lucy Reed, vice-
chairman.
Fourth district—J. C. Guinn, chairman; Mrs. E. L. Beach, vice-chairman.
Fifth district—Mrs. J. Marion Miller, chairman; Mrs. J. M. Hart, vice-
chairman.
Sixth district—Miss Jean Crawford,
chairman; Mrs. M. Jacobs, vice-chair-
man.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Women Voters Reaffirm Their
Confidence In Committee Of 18.
Resolution Passed Explaining Why No Women Were
Named To Run For Council On People's Ticket.
Plans Are Materializing.
Members of Knox County League
of Women Voters reaffirmed their
confidence in the Committee of
Eighteen Thursday afternoon with
the passage of a resolution based on
the statement issued some days ago
to the women of the city at large.
The resolution was offered by Miss
Ada Fanz and received only one dissenting vote. The statement embodied in the resolution reads as follows :
The Knox County League of
Women Voters has complete confidence in the men and women of
the Nominating Committee of the
People's ticket and we know that
they are not opposed to women in
public office.
We know that the absence of a
woman candidate  for position  of
Council-woman-at-large is due to
the refusal of a number of representative women who declined to
make the race after earnest solicitation on the part of the committee.    The refusal of these  women
to run was not due to any belief in
the   inferiority   of   their  sex,     but
was  due   to   their   conviction   that
 the   wider   experience   of    men   in
public work best    fitted     them to
inaugurate   a   new   form   of     City
Government.
We believe that the office should
seek the-woman and not the woman the office, and we deplore the
action   of  any  woman  running in
opposition   to   the   selected   candi-
dates of the People's Ticket.
The  division  in  the  Knox County
League of Women Voters over the
endorsement of the People's ticket
and the candidacy of Mrs. L. Crazier
French was discussed by a number
of the league members, among them
Mrs. S. L. Branch, who is manager
of Mrs. French's campaign. The
feeling was freely expressed by both
sides that while there was a differ-
ence of opinion all personalities,
veiled or openly expressed, should
be done away with and that the
separate campaigns be waged on a
high plane.
In view of the misunderstanding
that had seemed to exist, Mrs. W. L.
Morris read a telegram from Mrs.
Katherine P. Kenny, state president of the League of Women Voters
to the effect that Miss Mary Boyce
Temple is the representative of this
district on the state executive board
of the league, instead of Mrs. C. A.
Weaver, who was succeeded in
January by  Miss Temple.
The secretary read a letter also
from Mrs. Kenney voicing confidence in the work that the Knox
County league  is doing.
Reports of district chairmen on
registration indicated that plans of
the league in the interest of registration are materializing and that
the organization for the campaign is
going rapidly forward. At the next
meeting workers and watchers at
the   polls  will  be  chosen.
Purchase of a certified copy of
the city charter was authorized.
Names of two new members, Mrs.
M. R. Harrison and Mrs. Ignaz 
Fanz  were   announced.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Calendar For Christmas
The Collegiate Equal Suffrage League
of New York has published a calendar,
giving a suffrage quotation for everyday of the year. The colors of the
cover are blues and greys. Between
the Ionic columns are the stars of the 
four suffrage states. The calendar, it 
is hoped, will serve as excellent pro- 
paganda, for a mass of testimony is
put together, the quotations ranging
from Plato to Judge Lindsey. Many
of us will be surprised to find how
great a number of distinguished men
and women have already declared in
favor of woman suffrage. The calendar offers an answer, too; to the
frequent question as to the literature
of the subject, for a complete bibli-
ography could be made from the list
of authors. The price is $1.50, postpaid. Orders shoud be sent either to
Alice Duer Miller, 62 East 53rd St.,
N. Y. City, or to Harriet Burton Laid-
law, 312 West 90th St., N. Y. City.     
A few sample quotations:
 &quot;You possess the intelligence to
know how much of that happiness
which you are entitled to hope for,
both for yourselves and your children,
depends upon the right administration
of government and the proper tone of
public morals. That is a subject on
which the moral perceptions of women
are both quicker and juster than those
of men.'-—From Address to the Ladies
of  Richmond:    Daniel  Webster.
&quot;One   sex   bears   arms;   the   other
bears soldiers.&quot;
&quot;Not only is he idle who does nothing, but he is idle who might be better employed.&quot;—Socrates.
&quot;Woman suffrage is undoubtedly
coming, and I for one expect a great
deal of good to result from it.&quot;—Henry
W. Longfellow.
&quot;Everything in the movement to
give women the suffrage appeals to
my reverence and sense of justice.
There is no other help for men but in
their civic betterment.&quot;—William
Dean Howells.
&quot;I am not accustomed to use the
language of eulogy. I have never
studied the art of paying compliments
to women, but I must say that if all
that has been said by orators and
poets since the creation of the world
in praise of women were applied to the
women of America, it would not do
them justice for their conduct during
the war.&quot;—Abraham Lincoln.</dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN MUST STAND TOGETHER TO BRING ABOUT
IDEAL GOVERNMENT, MRS. KENNY DECLARES
President Of State League
Gives Principles For Which
Group Should Work.
The things that women will be
able to accomplish through organization, and the need for their par-
ticipation in politics were presented
to Knoxville women yesterday in
two stirring addresses by Mrs. John
M. Kenny, president of the Tennessee League of Women Voters.
Mrs. Kenny has been an ardent
worker for equal suffrage for sev-
eral years and based her message
on her own personal experiences
through this period and her careful
study of present political situations
in the nation, in the state and in the
municipalities.
Mrs. Kenny's first address was
made at the luncheon tendered In
her honor at noon at the Y. W. C.-
A. by the League of Women Voters
and which was attended by both
men and women. Later she addressed a large number of women
at the Lyceum building.
In her talk at the luncheon Mrs
Kenny confined herself to a discussion of the aims of the League of
Women Voters and the reason for
the existence of such an organization. This, Mrs. Kenny explained.
was primarily in order that women
might through standing shoulder to
shoulder, regardless of party organization, be able to procure recognition and bring about through their
exercise of suffrage the many things
that as women they saw and felt
the need of.
&quot;We believe in party organization,&quot; said Mrs. Kenny, &quot;and sometime we shall return to our respective parties; but at the present we
must stand together as women for
women, and for the bringing about
of our ideals of clean government.
&quot;I believe in the League of Women Voters as a safe and sane organization,&quot; said Mrs. Kenny. &quot;Because men, both democrats and republicans, could not get together in
one organization like this, they have
been prone to think that we could
not, but we can.
The necessity, of a definite program was strongly stressed by Mrs.
Kenny as a condition precedent to
success of the League and to gain-
ing the privilege of being admitted
later to the councils of the principal
parties. This cannot be expected in
a decade after 300 years of political
slavery, and patience will be necessary, she said.
Mrs. Kenny outlined the four prin- 
cipal things for which the League
of Women Voters stands as being 
(1) Efficiency in government, and in
this connection she urged upon all
women the necessity of a careful
study of political questions and an
intelligent use of the &quot;ballot.
The second thing for which the
League stands is legislation for women and children. Mrs. Kenny
referred to the recent fight for the
passage of the Sheppard-Towner bill
and declared that there would always be difficulty in the passing of
such bills until women were given
representation in the legislative
bodies of the state and nation.
Third, the League stands for representation on election boards. Mrs.
Kenny warmly commended Senator
Hill of Knox county for his support
of women for this position in event
the bill enlarging the number on
the election boards had passed the
last legislature.
The final principle of the League
as presented by Mrs. Kenny is &quot;cooperation to prevent war.&quot; &quot;Let us
start now,&quot; said Mrs. Kenny to interest women in the issues of coming national election. They must
be able to vote intelligently on the
international court of justice question which is going to be one of the
principal Issues.&quot;
Mrs. Kenny paused here to say
that the League of Women Voters
had endorsed the international court
of justice.
In closing Mrs. Kenny stated that
the ballot must become a part of
the daily life of every woman—bound
up with the care of the home, the
care of the children and all her other interests, for all of these things
were  directly  or indirectly affected by it.
IDA B. CHEATAM    When asked regarding the telegrams that had been released Mrs. Morrissaid that she had understood Mrs. Kenney to say that Mrs. Cheatam had wired her (Mrs. Morris) to the effect that she had nothing to do with the situation here, and that no such telegram had ever been received by her.  She said she had received the telegram regarding Miss Woolley, but that Mrs. Cheatam was laboring under a misapprehension in the matter, that never had the question of Miss Woolley's direction been brought up.
OFFICERS IN STATE
AND  LOCAL LEAGUE
OF WOMEN'S VOTERS
MRS. JNO. M. KENNY,
State President.
MRS. W. L. MORRIS,
Knox League. 
Preceding    Mrs.  Kenney (missing)
luncheon program were L.M.G.
Baker and Miss Mary B. Temple. 
Mr. Baker discussed briefly the 
great need f6r honest elections and 
the methods that were used to pre-
vent their being held. &quot;The square 
deal should apply in politics as well
as in everything else,&quot; said the 
speaker, &quot;and if women will join 
with the men who desire clean poli- 
tics, the time is not far distant
when such a condition as we hope
for will obtain.&quot; Mr. Baker decried 
the control of election machinery 
which is so often sought as a means
of election by candidates and stated 
that regardless of party every good 
citizen should stand for honesty in
elections. 
Miss Temple, in a brief talk expressed the thought that women are
giving too much time to clubs, and
have too great a variety of interests. She should combine these ac-
tivities and unite only on those
things looking to the betterment of
humanity. The two best ways in
which she can do this, said Miss
Temple, are first, the bettering in
practical ways of health conditions,
educational conditions and improvement of the ballot; and second, in
being loyal in all relations of life
and in fair dealing with one's fel-
lowman.
In closing her talk Miss Temple
ipreesnted Mrs. Kenny with a corsage
of roses, and paid a tribute to her
for her splendid work in behalf of
women.
Mrs. R. L. Cunningham who acted as toastmistress called for a talk
from Mrs. L. Crozler French, pioneer woman suffragist, but the latter declined to make a speech, taking time only to thank Mrs. Kenny and Mrs. Cunningham for the praise
which she had been accorded for her
long service in behalf of woman suffrage.
Women Of City Hear Campaign Methods Used In
Nashville's Election.
The importance of woman's part
in matter of government, with particular reference to municipal affairs
was discussed by Mrs. John M. Kenny, president of Tennessee League
of Women Voters, in her address at
the Lyceum, building yesterday af- 
ternoon.
Mrs. Kenny urged especially the
organization of the women of Knoxville and Knox county as the first
step in bringing about the things
for which as individuals they stand.
MRS. LESLIE M. KENNEDY,
Knox League
There can be no strength without
organization and program, said the
speaker.
Much of Mrs. Kenny's talk had to
do with the work of the Nashville
League in the recent city election
and contained many suggestions for
the benefit of local women in view
of the approaching municipal elec-
tion in this city.
&quot;Women must be made to see their
opportunity for service in situations
like this, and that they can make
their city just what they want it
to be. If you have high ideals and
work for them, you will certainly
realize them. But, let me tell you,
said Mrs. Kenny, &quot;that eternal vigilance will be the price you will have
to pay. You must be always and
eternally  on  the  job!&quot;
&quot;The recent election in Nashville
did not go to suit the League of
Women Voters, but we made our influence felt as it had been felt before, and clearly outlined our stand
for   clean   government.&quot;
House to house canvasses were
made in organizing the women of
that city, and at every voting place
on election day women worked at
the polls, having at hand a card index showing the registration and poll
tax lists of all wards, and seeing
that everything was done in accordance with the law. &quot;Some of our
most prominent women worked from
early morning until after the polls
had closed and the returns had been
made in certain wards, and the re-
sults when compared with those of
former elections showed that their
labors had been most worthwhile.&quot;
&quot;You know women work for ideals, 
and men work for jobs,&quot; said  Mrs.
Kenny smiling,   &quot;and with this  un-
selfishness in our labor we are sure
to accomplish good.&quot;'
Mas. Kenny feels that women
should have representation on all
boards or commissions of the city
which involve dealing with women
and children. She told of the splendid work that has been accomplished
in Nashville by the municipal hospital commission since the placing
of women thereon, and of the work-
ings of the Women's Protective Bureau of that city which was established a few years ago.
Mrs. Kenny also made the point
that only the most qualified women
should be backed for positions of
any kind, but that women should
take advantage of every opportunity to have representation where it
could be given.
Another thing Mrs. Kenny urged
was the strict observance of laws.
&quot;The so-called foolish acts of the
flapper do not concern me half so
much as the careless observance of
certain of  the laws  that are  upon
our statute books. Whether we approve a law or not we sould
respect it as long as it remains a law.&quot;

<dc:description>Members of the group in the Knox
County   League   of Women   Voters
who   deposed  Mrs.   W.     L.   Morris, president,  and &quot;expelled&quot;  her  from
membership in the league, feel that
they have  been officially recognized
by Mrs. John M. Kenney, state pres-
ident,   in  view  of  the  appointment
yesterday   of   12   of  their   members
to be chairmen of local committees
for the coming convention to be held
here on March 18 and 19, while oniy
one of the league aligned with Mrs.
Morris was named.    Another  mem- 
ber of the league who has announced her neutrality was also appointed.
No official action on the part of the state executive board has been made by Mrs. Kennedy, however. Announcement of the plans of each faction for its meeting Thursday, which is the redular meeting day of the league, also indicates that an interesting session will feature each meeting, with the appointment of convention delegates at the Morris meeting and the reading of the minutes of three meetings held by the Cunningham group at the St. James hotel, and about which there has centered considerable discussion, namely the Saturday night meeting 
and those on Monday morning and Thursday morning, at the
last of which Mrs. Morris was &quot;ex- 
pelled.&quot;
Telegrams which  passed  between
Mrs. W. L. Morris and Mrs. Ida B.
Cheatam   relative   to   the   situation
here   following Miss   Woolley's   de-
parture  were   also   released  by  the
group   opposed   to   Mrs.   Morris,   at 
the request of Mrs.   Kenney.   Members of the league releasing the tel-
grams  said  that Mrs.   Kenney   had
requested their release in view of the
 fact that Mrs. Morris had said she
had nothing but a long distance telephone communication    from    Mrs.
Cheatam.
Committees Named
Mrs.   Kenney's     appointment    of
chairmen   to   serve   in   preparation
for the state meeting of the league 
in   Knoxville,   is   as   follows:     Miss 
Jean  Crawford, local arrangements; 
Mrs. J. Marion Miller, Mrs. William 
Gilbert, Mrs. N. S. Woodward, Mrs. 
William Bronwlee (sic.), credentials; Mrs.   
 E. L. Thomas and Mrs. N. E. Logan,
program; Miss Mary Boyce Temple
and  Mrs.   R.    L.    Cunningham,  co-
chairmen reception; Miss Ada Fanz,
publicity; Miss Emma Pate, finance; 
Mrs.   J.   B.   Guinn  and  Mrs.   Lucy Reed, printing;  Mrs.  Fred A. Ault,
invitations.
Mrs. Lucy Reed is the only member of the league appointed who
champions the cause of Mrs. Morris.
Mrs. Guinn has recently announced
her neutrality as between the factions.
Mrs. Morris would not comment
on the apointment last night, but
Mrs. Sherwood Johnston said that
she had never known this procedure
in the appointment of local convention committees to be followed before—that it was the reule (sic.) for a local organization to appoint or recommend chairmen for all committees
charged with arrangements, and that
it seemed to her to be irregular.
Mrs. Johnston also said that these
appointments of Mrs. Kenney seemed to indicate where her sympathies
in the controversy lay. She said
that she did not feel that Mrs. Kenney was fully informed on local conditions and felt that she had taken
an unfair position in the matter.
Members of the other faction who
were reached last night, said they
had not been advised by Mrs. Kenney as yet of their appointment,
but that they would serve and do
all they could to assist Mrs. Kenney
to make a success of the convention.
Telegrams Given Out
The telegrams    released  by  Mrs.
Kenney   through   members     of  the
league   bearing   on   Miss   Woolley's
visit  here  follow:
Knoxville, Tenn., Feb, 12, 1924.
Mrs. Elliot Cheatam, 696 Peachtree
Street, Atlanta, Georgia.
Miss Woolley has left town. Why
I do not know as she has not communicated with me since Saturday
night. Did she leave by your advice or by Mrs. Kenney's? Whoever is responsible must furnish
me immediately necessary and official reason for failure to meet en-
gagement to speak before Girls' National Junior League of America, a
large and influential organization.
It appears Kenney came here at re-
quest of bolting members. Her visit
here, remaining over until noon today, resulted in a definite split in
my leaigue. I will continue campaign, with strong supporters behind
me, who join in asking you to come
to us with assistance as soon as possible.
MRS. WILLIAM L. MORRIS,
President Knox County League  of
Women Voters.
Reply sent to Mrs. Morris, February 12, 1924:
National places Miss Woolley under direction of Mrs. Kenney while
in Tennessee, I understood you did
not wish Woolley to remain in
Knoxville unless exclusively under

<dc:description>Mrs. LC. French To
Be Highly Honored
The French Memorial Room, in
the headquarters of the Women's
Party in Washington, willbe dedicated to Mrs. L. Crozier French, a
pioneer worker for women's rights
in the South and the founder of
Ossoli Circle in Knoxville. This honor is being paid to Mrs. French
while she is still living to show her
the great love that her native state
holds  for   her.
The Woman's Party for Tennessee has charge of the decorating
and furnishing of the room, and
Mrs. S. L. Branch of Knoxville is
the general chairman of the work.
Mrs. Branch has sub-committees
in West, Middle and East Tennessee. Mrs. S. G. Heiskell of Knoxville is chairman of the East Tennessee committee.
There was a meeting of this division at the home of Mrs. French
on Wednesday morning to complete
plans for the work. All the decorating in the room has been finished,
and it is now ready for the furnishings.
Each women's club in the state
is asked to give one article toward   the   furnishing of   the  room.
Only old pieces of strictly Tennessee colonial style will be used in
furnishing the room. Some of the
furniture of President and Mrs.
Polk will be used. A lady in Middle Tennessee has donated a sugar
chest over one hundred years old.
Other pieces that have been con-
tributed are a fireside chair, given
by Mrs. Wm. C. Ross, and some of
the furniture of President Johnson.
Anyone who has old furniture that 
she would like to give, or anyone
who would like to give money should 
communicate with Mrs. S. L. 
Branch, Box 647, or, Mrs. S. G.
Heiskell, 710 Henley street. Mrs.
Heiskell is chairman of the Ossoil
committee   and   state   treasurer.
The Women's Party headquar- 
ters in Washington is an old build- 
ing on Capitol Hill. Mrs. Belmont
gave it to the Women's Party to 
be used for political headquarters.
The house was at one time the cap-
itol of the United States for seven
years. It is made up of three old
homes, and at present it has forty
rooms in it.
Several of the states have completed the decorating and furnishing of their rooms: Virginia, Dela-
were, Colorado, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Others are working oi
their rooms.
The L. Crozier French Room will
be dedicated early in December at
the   time   when   congress   convenes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>&quot;WOMAN'S RIGHTS&quot; IN TEXAS
New York Times:
To the Editor of The New York Times:      	
It appears that in a communication in
the Sunday issue of The New York
Times of some days back, Ethel M.
Smith, in writing of the proposed equal
rights amendment to the Federal Constitution, mentions that the State of
Texas denies to a married woman the
control of her own earnings; while in
a subsequent issue of The Times of
Jan. 22, it appears that Paul Caruthers Morris  of  your  city,   in  a   communica-
tion, says Miss Smith is in error in the above statement as to the laws of the State of Texas, and kindly takes her to task with the suggestion that her sisters should look up her charges before taking them seriously.  And in that connection he essays to set her aright with the further statement, as the truth of the matter, that Texas, along with certain other States named by him, is a community property State, and that under the laws of that State the wife's earnings belong in half to her husband, and cites in support of his statement a Law Directory published in your city.
As an old practioner down in this far-off State, I beg to submit to Mr. Morris that he in turn is in error, due possibly to his like failure to &quot;look up the law&quot; further on the point--though he seems to be only half right as to the same.  Yes, Texas is, and from the beginning may be classed as a community property State, but of late years it has become something more is response to the demands of modern woman for her &quot;rights,&quot; and though somewhat cumbrous in dimensions has &quot;got a move&quot; on her in response to such demands; as under recent enactments of it Legistatures,
which have &quot;finally
&quot;seen the light,&quot; all of the earnings of
the wife belong to her, is subject to her
exclusive control, and to do with as she
pleases. She is also given like control
of all her other separate property and 
to dispose of as may suit her whim and 
without any interference on the part of
her husband; save that the joinder of
her husband is necessary in a convey-
ance or encumbrance by her of her real estate; and in the latter instance if her spouse balks she may go to court and procure such conveyance without his joinder therein, (See Acts of Texas Legislature of 1917, p. 436, and of 1921, p. 251).
Moreover, while the wife by these en-
actments has absolute control over her
earnings,  to  cast them  at the birds, or
to  the  milliners,  as  suits  her whim,  a subservient Legislature, by further enactment, has provided that in the event of the failure or refusal of the husband
to  provide  for  the  proper support  and
maintenance of the wife, or if he &quot;runs
away&quot;   to   avoid   the   discharge   of   the duty, he
may  be brought  back and be put in jail or be put to penal servitude until he signifies a willingness to discharge his marital duty.
Hence,   it  may  be  a little  difficult to
conceive   what   further   rights   the   for-
ward looking women of the Lone Star
State may crave, unless possibly the prerogative of possessing more than one
husband at one and the same time, and
with   the   privilege   of   driving   them   in
tandem   or   in   pairs   as   may suit their pleasure.
F.M. BRANTLEY     Fort Worth, Texas, Jan. 29, 1924.</dc:description>

<dc:description>NEARLY 18,000
ARE REGISTERED
Half as Many Women as Men
Reported, Books Close at
9 O'Clock Tonight
Despite the fact that today is the last
day of the biennial registration, the
books closing tonight at 9 o'clock, only
about 100 more women and 126 more
men had registered up until noon today
than had registered when the books
were closed last night at 9 o'clock, according to reports from each of the precincts. Up until noon today reports
show: Men registered, 11,663; women
registered, 5,898; total, 17,561.
In order to vote in the municipal elections or the constitutional convention
election, citizens must have registration
certificates of the present general registration.
It has been suggested that the rain
of this morning was partly responsible
for the light registration for the half day
and that the afternoon would see from
600  to  800  additional  registrations.

<dc:description>Campaign After Thursday.
Mrs. Thomas Peacock Miller, chair-
man of the league, stated just before
the meeting adjourned that after regis-
tering closes Thursday night members
of the league and candidates will be at
liberty to carry on campaigns for them-
selves   or   anyone   else   they   are   inter -
ested in.    Ward committees of the Non
Partisan league will try to invite all
candidates to address them at meetings
to be held in the near future and every
effort will be made to give all candidates equal opportunities to state their
reasons for candidacy.

<dc:description>&quot;We have heard all the candidates-
and next Wednesday Senator E. E. Pat-
ton will discuss the school situation from
every angle and each candidate is asked
to come to hear Senator Patton. Possibly no one in Knox county knows really
more about the city and county schools
than he. The Non-Partisan league has
concentrated on the school as the largest
issue in the coming election. Certainly
nothing could he more important, and
we really desire the candidates to familiarize themselves on the school subject.    It will be worth much to them.
&quot;We have discussed equalization of
taxes. We need more money for our
schools. We ought to pay our teachers more and only through an equalization of taxes could this millenium
exist. We need police protection—if the
force isn't large enough to cover and
protect Knoxville—then let's stretch a
point and enlarge it.
&quot;We want our city to be an all-around
beautiful one—materially and spiritually.
Constructive work has been done—we
have splendid streets and school buildings. The Non-Partisan league has studied in a general and comparative way
the principles of municipal frovernment
in other cities—giving special consideration to certain principles that may be
advantageously applied to our own city
affairs.
&quot;The sentiment of this organization is
in no sense partisan, and will take no
part in the nomination of candidates. It
is the aim of the league to give such information as will enable individual mem-
bers to thoroughly understand the necessary qualifications for a candidate for
any municipal office.
&quot;The Non-Partisan Political league intends neither to recommend nor condemn any man or woman who may be
seeking an office; but, we expect the
members of the league to be able to
make decisions more intelligently be-
cause of the study inaugurated by the
policy of the league.'</dc:description>

Who was it suffered the most in the
war   between   the  states  and  in   the
late  world-wide  war?    It    was    the
motherhood of this country. Ladies to
me  mother is  the sweetest name  in
all  the  world.  It  is  she     who    goes
down    into   the   valley   of   death   to
give him birth. It is she who nestled
him   in   her  arms   and   coos   him   to
sleep  and   later  it   is  she  who  leads
him  into   Sunday school  and  church
and it was she who. during the last
two years followed him to the depot
and   bid   him   a   fond   farewell   with
a  smile  on  her face  and  a bleeding
heart,  giving  her boy  as   a  sacrifice
that we  migrht live  in   peace  and in
happiness.   It   mattered   not   whether (missing)

liable for poll tax and would be allow[ed]
to vote without poll tax. Since thinking,
the statement I made in regard to the
poll tax feature applying to women vot- 
ers might excuse them. But for their 
safety if they do not care to make a 
test suit they should at least have Gen. 
Frank M. Thompson, of Chattanooga, 
give the state election commission an
opinion if the women are liable for poll
tax for 1918 and 1919 before they can 
vote as the law enfranchising them was
passed after the tenth day of Janu- 
ary, 1919. If this is true you would not 
have to pay your poll tax to vote for 
the president who I hope will be Wil-
liam Gibbs McAdoo, whose dear sweet
mother was president of Ossili 1890-91,
and 1900-1901.
&quot;I now have some ballots, and if you 
so desire, we will hold our first election
for   mayor   and Commissioners,   so   you
can see the practical side.&quot;

<dc:description>GREATER KNOXVILLE     REGISTRATION
TOTALS 17,348 - BOOKS CL0SE TODAY
14,000 May Vote In Primaries

7,553 Persons Have Paid Polls
in Greater Knoxville.
Registration  Will  Show   Approximately 5,000 Women.
1,285 Service Men Have Been
Released—Others Past 50.
Some Are Just 21.

A total of 7,443 persons, residing in
the twenty-six wards of Greater Knoxville have paid their 1918 poll tax, according to the figures just compiled by
officials at the courthouse. This is said
to be about the largest number who
have paid poll taxes in any one year.
It was also reported at the courthouse
Wednesday that a total of 1,285 returned soldiers had secured releases from
poll taxes, under the resolution enacted
by the quarterly county court at the
January session this year. It is expected that many more of these soldiers
will secure releases before the day of
election.
Taking the large number who have
paid poll taxes, those who have secured
releases, those who are over 50 years of
age and not subject to poll taxes; those
who have just become twenty-one years
of age, and not subject for this year's
poll tax; and the large number of women
who intend to participate in the coming
political contests, the indications are
that the coming primary city election
will certainly be the largest ever held
in the history of Knoxville or Knox
county.
It is expected that there will be 5,000
women participate in the coming election and if this be true, and with those
who have paid poll taxes; secured releases; too old for poll taxes and who
have just arrived at their majority, the
total vote in the primary election will, in
all probabilities, reach the 14,000 mark,
which will even be larger than any
county  election  here.
In the payment of poll taxes, the eleventh ward leads with a total of 860,
while the smallest number in any one
ward is the fourth, with only ninety-two.
The number of poll taxes paid in the various wards is as follows:-   First   295    Second   206    Third  149   Fourth   91  Fifth   256   Sixth   254   Seventh   517   Eighth   222   Ninth   615   Tenth   536   Eleventh   860   Twelfth   169   Thirteenth   100 Fourteenth   496   Fifteenth   389   Sixteenth   196   Seventeenth   367   Eighteenth  140   Nineteenth   316   Twentieth   256   Twenty-first   814(?)    Twenty-second     193   Twenty-third  95   Twenty-fourth  106   Twenty-fifth  186   Twenty-sixth  331  Total  7553
service,  together with a living salary,
is my remedy for the trouble.
Favors 2-Platoon.
&quot;Another thing I want to say right
here is that I am strongly in favor of
the 2-platoon system for firemen. It is
out of the question for a city to take
men and say to them; 'Here, you have
to stay in these fire halls 24 hours every
day.' 'They are asking for a 12-hour day
—other men are asking for an eight-
hour day.
Women's Vote.
&quot;If you will allow me one more digres-
sion from my general subject I will tell
you about seeing the women in Johnson
City while I was in the city teaching at the East Tennessee State normal
summer school. Ove 700 women regis-
tered and voted. There are only two
wards in Johnson City and in one of
them 35 votes were cast out because they were folded or marked wrong How
many of them do you suppose 'mere man'
had cast? Just thirty-three!&quot;
Mr. Patton concluded his address by
urging Knoxville people to correct troub-
les in their schools and to establish systems which will make it possible for
needs of the children of the city to be
met bv the schools.                                                                                                                                                                  Figures Show 11,599 Men and
5,749 Women.  Grand Total Tonight Will Likely
Exceed 18,000.
Heavy   Qualifying-  Among  Recently Enfranchised Voters

Complete figures received from all of 
the 31 precincts in Greater Knoxville by
The Journal and Tribune after the close
of the registration books last night show
that 11,599 men have obtained registration certificates while the number of
women registrants totals 5,749, bringing
the total number of registrants up to 17,-
348.
These figures were obtained over the
telephone direct from the registrars in
charge  of the  precincts.
On the basis of these figures it is safe
to predict that the total number of registrants at the close of the biennial registration tongiht(sic.) at 9 o'clock will be well
over 18,000,

<dc:description>REGISTRATION
PLEASES WOMEN
Delighted With Showing Made
During Biennial Period.
Chairman      of     Non-Partisan
League  Urges  All  Qualified
to Go to Polls and Vote.
Mrs. Thomas Peacock Miller, chairman of the Knoxville Non-Partisan
league, stated Thursday afternoon that
she and other members of the league are
more than delighted with the results of
the campaign to secure a heavy registration for the coming municipal elections
&quot;It is perfectly splendid,&quot; Mrs. Miller
declared in discussing the total registration of women. &quot;To be frank, when we
began I did not expect anything like such results.  The success of the women's
part of the registration   is  due
to just one thing--a large number of splendid women put their shoulders to the wheel
and helped the league carry out the plans it made even before it was sure Knoxville women could vote.
&quot;One thing I should like to deny in the name of the league is the statement that it was organized as a political 
machine to be used in the interest of any one group of candidates.  I was surprised the other day when a woman told me that we have been accused of being a political machine. I told her, as the league will tell the Knoxville public, to kindly recall the fact that the league was organized May 9, before we were even sure that we could vote.  The state legislature had given Tennessee women municipal and presidential suffrage, but even the authorities were declaring the act unconstitutional.
&quot;I also referred to the fact that at the time the league was organized that candidates in questoin had not come out when our work began and that for that reason, as well as others, we could not have formed the league to promote the interests of any one group of candidates.

Purpose of League.
&quot;The purpose of the league is solely
the betterment of conditions in Knox-
ville and the careful study of the vari-
ous phases of municipal activities. I
challenge any one to prove that candi-
dates have not been given equal advantages at our meetings or
that we have at these meetings attempted to secure
favor for one man at the expense of his
competitors. We have solicited interest
for all of  the candidates—we have asked 
both men and women to register and 
vote for the men they think best quali-
fied to hold office and have urgently re-
quested the public to study Knoxville
carefully and to use its own judgment 
in casting its ballot. 
&quot;Our aim in the work to create interest in registration has been to give each
candidate a fair  chance to present   lhs
claims for office as well as to give the
Knoxville public a &quot;fair chance to hear
what   he   has   to   say   on   certain   vital 
questions.   In the  meetings  to  be held
throughout the wards for the purpose
allowing all   of the candidates  to open 
active  campaigns,  our purpose will be 
the same. Before registration was com- 
pleted  we   asked   taht (sic.)   campaigning   be
postponed  until  after  Thursday   night,
but   stated   that   atfe (sic.)  rthat (sic.)   time   each
candidate  would  be  free  to  appear   at
meetings arranged by the ward committees in campaign speeches. Some of the
wards are already busy  completing ar-
rangements for  such  meetings,  and,   I
understand every ward committee will attempt to hear
every candidate before elections are held.
Permanent Organization.
&quot;The Non-Partisan league will be a
permanent organization. It was formed
not only to use its influence toward securing city officias best fitted for the
work, but also to carry out a program
of studies on local conditions and to foster movements for correcting unsatisfactory conditions. The school question
was taken up first because recent agitations led us to believe that of the
many questions which the city must settle sooner or later it was foremost in
the public mind. Other questions will be
taken up as time goes on and the league,
with the co-operation of the Knoxville
public, will try to help make the new
administration the best in the history of
the city. The personnel of the new commission will not heighten or lower our
interest in the welfare of the city and
will not change our plan to stand by it
during the next four years.&quot;
Ask Women to Vote Early.
Mrs. Miller, as chairman of the Non-
Partisan league, and Roy Beeler, as
chairman of the election commission,
are planning to ask women to go to the
polls early on election day in order that
the noon hour and the early evening
hours may be given over to men and
women who work during the day.
Women employed in house-keeping or
other occupations, which will allow a
few hours' freedom during the morning,
are asked to vote before noon. If this
is impossible they are asked to vote during the afternoon. 
Wants All Women to Vote.
&quot;The registration has proven such a
success that it would never do for the
women who have their registration certificates not to vote,&quot; Mrs. Miller concluded. 'I hope that every woman who
has registered will vote. We want a
heavy vote.&quot;
Certificates to be Mailed.
Announcement was made Thursday
afternoon that registration certificates
for people who registered from out of
town will be mailed to their home addresses within a few days. Mrs. Miller
especially requests that all women who
have registered in this way watch for
their certificates and  preserve  them carefully.</dc:description>

With the supreme court  decision.
Saturday upholding the right of women
to vote in municipal and Presidential
elections in Tennessee, political wiseacres were put more at sea in any effort to pick the probable winners of the
city primary which will be held Sept. 6.
The unknown quantity in this election, because there is no precedent upon which to base an estimate, is the
strength of the probable vote of the enfranchised women.
Women are not required to pay a poll
tax in order to vote. They must register, however, and with the bi-ennial
general registration set for the second
week in August, it may be possible to
cbtain some fairly accurate idea of the
probable vote in the September elections after this registration is held. It
is well to remember that all voters
must register in this August registration in order to qualify. This is a general
registration and papers secured last
year or this year at a supplemental
registration are not valid. In order to
vote in September, everyone must
register this August.
Here is a Guess.
Here is the way some politicians figure the women's vote this fall. Only
about half of the men of voting age
cast their ballots. There are as many, or
approximately as many, women of voting age as there are men. But on account of the newness of suffrage to women, it is figured that only about half
as many women as men will exercise
that right. That basis would mean that
about one-fourth of the women of voting age will cast their ballots. However,
this is mere guess. The proportion, may
be one in eight or seven in eight, according to how the women of Knoxville
feel about the subject and whether they
consider, as a whole, that the issues
sufficiently great to arouse their interest.
One thing may be certain, however,
the.potential vote of the women
of Greater Knoxville will have a
strong influence on the campaign from now on.
Number of Men Qualified.
To date, there have been 5,500 poll
taxes paid in Greater Knoxville. Re-
leases have been granted 426 former
service men. There are probably 1,000
men over age or who have just attained
their majority and are exempt. That
would give a potential vote of nearly
7,000 men alone already. The time for
payment of poll taxes expires Aug. 6,
which is one week from next Wednesday. In those ten days, 1,000 or more
poll taxes or releases probably will be
added, making a total, at a rough estimate, of 8,000 men who will be qualified.
This is probably a little low, if anything,
and of course does not represent the
voting strength of the men of Greater
Knoxville, many of whom will not
qualify, judging from past experience.
Also, all those who do qualify will not
vote. 
In the municipal election four years
ago, before the days of Greater Knoxville, 5,189 votes were cast for mayor
in the 11 wards of the old city. In the
county election last August, 6,334 votes
were cast in the 26 city wards in the
highest race in the republican primary,
last August, 3,993 votes were cast in
this purely partisan contest in the city
wards. In the general election last November, a few less than 4,300 votes were
cast in the city words.
With so many service men back in
civil life and with 19 candidates already
in the field for the first municipal pri-
mary of Sept. 6, it is probable that at
least as many men will vote then as
voted at the county election in last August—6,334 The number should be
higher but the campaign thus far has
been quiet and the populace, to put it
mildly,  does not appear to be excited.
If half as many women as men vote,
as  some figure,  the new suffrage will
add approximately  3,167,  accepting the
foregoing basis for comparison, making
a probable total of 9,501.
The big questions for the candidates
are: How many women will vote and for
whom will they vote and what manner
of appeal will  influence their vote?
19 Candidates Now.
Thus far, two candidates have announced for mayor and 17 for commissioner m the nonpartisan primary. No
others are expected to enter the race
for the mayoralty. There may be two,
possibly three, more for commissioner
before the lists close. In a two-man race,
the mayor will be elected in the first
primary. The eight men receiving the
highest vote for commissioner must
contest in the run-off two weeks later,
unless one or more receive a majority
of all ballots cast in the first primary,
which is unlikely with so many entrants
to scatter the vote.
In the 1[9]15 primary, there were two
candidates for mayor and 24 for commissioner.
This year, only two of the five suc-
cessful candidates of the 1915 election
are running again—Mayor McMillan and
Commissioner Crumbliss—and only two
of the unsuccessful 21 candidates of
four years ago thus far have decided
to try it again, these two being Ed. M.
Gillenwaters and Nathan B. Kuhlman.
Mr. Gillenwaters ran eighth in the first
primary in 1915 and was the seventh
man in the field of eight in the second
primary, being oliminated (sic.). Mayor McMillan received 901 majority in 1915.
Commissioner Crumbliss, who seeks reelection now, four years ago ran second in the field of 24 in the first primary and fourth in the field of eight in the second primary.
There are rumors of various combinations in the present campaign, but
none seems to be particularly strong at
present. It is quite apparent that it is
to be a &quot;non-partisan&quot; primary as already some strong democrats are lined
up with republicans and some republican leaders are backing a democrat or
two.    </dc:description>

<dc:description>REGISTRATION POINTS NAMED
Commission Receives Qualifications of Registrars.
Attention of Voters   Called   to
Necessity of  Re-Registering
for Elections.
Places where registration booths will
be established in the various precincts
in the city and county were named at a
meeting of the election commission held 
here yesterday.
The commission also received the
qualifications of the newly appointed
registrars who will conduct the general
registration to begin on Aug. 11 and end 
on Aug. 21.
Members of the commission wish to 
impress on all voters that the coming
registration is held in compliance with 
the biennial registration laws, and it
will be necessary for all voters to procure a registration receipt in order to 
participate in the municipal elections. 
Although the next meeting date of the 
commission has not been determined, it
is probable the body will meet about the
20th of this month to appoint election
officers for the municipal elections, and 
to make other arrangements for the 
elections. 
This meeting will be one of the most 
important held by the commission since
the new members were inducted into office two months ago.

treasurer for each ward in the district; and a chairman for each block
in the ward, this chairman also to
have a corps of assistants.
Probably the most organization
work yet done has been in the sixth
district under the leadership of Miss
Jean Crawford. This district is already fairly well organized in the
manner explained. The second ward
is also proceeding rapidly with its
organization work under the direction
of Miss Kate White.
The purpose of the meeting this afternoon was to fill in all vacancies
which had existed in the initial organization work, in order that tne
ward organization work could get
under way as soon as possible. In
the near future a meeting will be
held when it is hoped to have a large
representation from each ward in the
city.
A vice-president and a corresponding secretary of the League of Women Voters were due to be elected
this afternoon.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Women's Industrial Conference   
Meets In Washington January 18
All national women's organizations and
all national organization having a large proportion of women members are
being asked to send delegates to the Women's Industrial Conference In washington January 18 to 21.  Employers and business organizations have also been invited. 
The call to the conference was issued today by the Women's Bureau
of the U. S. Department of Labor,
accompanied by a letter of endorsement, and approval from the secretary of labor,  who says:
&quot;There are eight and a half million employed women and their number is increasing rather than decreasing. It seems to me that this situation creates special problems,
which call for careful consideration
of means by which to safeguard the mothers and potential mothers of the nation.  In the last decade the increase of married Women in manufacturing and mechanical industries was 41 per cent. In the occupations connected with trade there has been an increase of 43 per cent for all women employed but an increase of 88 per cent among married women. Therefore, it is im- possible to separate entirely the problems of motherhood from the conditions under which women are Iemployed. There is nothing more important in our civilization and every thinking American must realize this situation. It is with great pleasure, therefore, that I approve of your plans for calling a 3-day conference.  Miss Mary Anderson, director of the Women's Bureau. which is holding the conference, says in her call which  goes  out today:  &quot;The,   Women's    Bureau    believes  that a conference of women, including representatives from all, national organizationsof women and other interested groups would go  far not
 only to focus attention on the problems involved, but to help in the development of policies and standards for the
effective  employment of women in industry. Our indus-
trial success will depend largely
upon the practices in industry which 
make for the health and happiness 
of women workers. It is with this
in mind we are calling the confer-,
ence and urge the fullest partici-
pation by the women of the country.&quot;
The conference will be held in the
New National Museum, beginning 
the morning of January 18, and con-
tinuing for three days. 
The list of organizations invited in-
cludes  representatives from all  sections   of   the  country.
A partial list of organizations follows:
 American Association of Univer-
sity Women, American Association
for Labor Legislation, American Fed-
eration of Labor, Women's Auxil-
 iaries to the National Unions,

<dc:description>PLEASED WITH
REGISTRATION
Mrs. T. P. Miller Says Women
Are Encouraged.
Goal of Organization Is to Have
50 Per Cent of Sex Qualify
to Vote.
&quot;We are very encouraged over tbe
registration of women this past week
and feel certain that fifty per cent of
all eligible women voters will registe-
before the 21st,&quot; declared Mrs. T. P.
Miller, chairman of the Non-Partisan
Political League, last night.
&quot;Amusing incidents are told by ward
and block chairmen. One chairman
was sitting on the porch of a woman in
her ward and the woman was telling her
how bitterly her husband opposed the
idea of suffrage, when said husband appeared. He ordered the chairman off
the porch and premises. She was a
tactful woman and instead of flaring up
she admired the children and the pretty
lawn, etc., and when he regained his
composure she insidiously presented per-
tinent reasons why his wife should
shoulder her responsibility and vote, as 
hundreds of other Knoxville women
would do. He saw the light and invited her to stay for supper, and also
said he wanted his wife to get out and help.
&quot;Another chairman tells of visiting a
timid little woman who said: It was not
in the jurisdiction of women to vote,
they ought not to pray in public, etc.
Her husband was reading on the other
side of the porch and overhearing the
block chairman's persuasive voice—with
paper in hand came round to where the
two women were talking and said: &quot;Do
you want to be the only woman in this
block who has not registered ? If you
really do—I don't wan't you to—I'd feel
mortified if my wife couldn't do as well
as the rest of them.' The wife consented.
&quot;Daily reports from     the wards   are
awaited with   interest,     each   chairman
hoping to have the banner ward.
Urges  Earnestness.
&quot;Knoxville is naturally a beautiful city
and now that the women have a voice 
in the election of the people who oversee 
it, we must think earnestly and inielli-
gently, weighing each man mentally 
and morally, giving full credit where it
is due and conscientiously cast our bal- 
lot for the man whom we find fit, abso- 
lutely regardless of party. It has been
said that men who know no such thing
as 'non-partisan,' that they will run true
to form, once a democrat, always a dem- 
ocrat, once a republican always a re-
publican. I feel sure the women will 
look for the man, not the partv.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Oldest Woman Registered Says
It  Is &quot;Religious   Duty   of   All
Women to Register and to Vote&quot;
&quot;I firmly believe that it is the re-
 ligious duty of every decent woman of
 Knoxville to register and vote in the
coming elections now that the women
have actually obtained the right of
suffrage,&quot; said Mrs. Emma Doyle, 812
Second street, the oldest woman who
has registered in Knoxville so far, for
the coming municipal election, when
interviewed by a reporter for The
Sentinel. Mrs. Doyle is 83 years old,
and will soon celebrate her 84th
birthday. She registered last Thursday, in the twenty-sixth ward.
&quot;When the question of woman suffrage first came up I was opposed to
it,&quot; continued Mrs. Doyle, &quot;and I still
maintain the view that it would have
been a far better thing for the country if the women had not received the
vote. But, now that the women have
that right, those of the low and vicious classes are going to register
and vote without exception; and the
educated, God-fearing women of
Knoxville are going to have to vote
in pure self-defense, and in defense
of the city government.&quot;
&quot;I have already picked out my men,
and in doing so have tried to select
men who stood for a better, cleaner
condition of municipal politics. That
is what every modern city needs today. The general tendency over the
country is very often toward the low
and vicious and we of Knoxville must
see to it that men are placed in office
who will not tolerate such a condition
of things. If the right men are not
able to get into office, I can plainly
see the day—not so far in the future--
when women will be running for of-
fice; and not only running for office,
but getting there. Women have always had a way of getting what they
wanted.
&quot;As for myself, l still believe that
the rightful place of woman is in the
home. I have always found it so, and 
it seems to me that the world got
along mighty well with that way of 
living. I did not register in order
simply to vote, for I do not care that
much about the ballot. I did it simply, as I said before, because I believe that every woman of the better
class owes it to herself, her children
and to her community, to do what
she can to aid in straightening out the
city financially, cleaning it up morally, and in making of it. a better place
in which to live. I hear that the women of the state of Oklahoma, who
have been voting for some time, have
succeeded in running out the pool
halls and second class shows. If that
is the case, then the ballot should 
prove a good thing after all.&quot;  
Although  Mrs.  Doyle  is  nearly   84 
years old, she does all her own house
work, and &quot;gets around as spry as any
one.&quot;    She is a firm believer in the
maxium that &quot;a person is just as old 
as she feels.&quot;   When the reporter in- 
terviewed her this morning, she had 
just completed a washing which many 
a younger woman would not think of 
doing, as &quot;help just can not be gotten
and   the   laundry   just   simply   tears 
your things all to pieces.&quot;
&quot;I hope you will  encourage  every 
good woman you know to register and
vote when the time comes, next September,&quot; concluded Mrs. Doyle. </dc:description>

<dc:description>WOMEN MUST GIVE EXACT AGE
IN REGISTERING IN COUNTY
Commission Will Sustain Registrars in Demand That All Seeking to Qualify as Voters Give Exact Age—Members of
Various Boards Being Sworn in Today With Few Changes
in Personnel.
Mirabile dictu!
The Knox county election commis.-
sion today ruled that women must
tell their exact age to qualify themselves to register in the general biennial registration which will begin
Monday morning in Knoxville and
Knox county and will continue
through August    18.
Roy H. Beeler, chairman of the
election commission, stated this
morning that he will sustain any and
all registrars who require of each
and every woman as a qualification
to register that she reveal her exact
ag[e] in answering the question as to
age contained in the list of questions
necessary to  qualify  registrants.
Hal H. Clements, secretary of the
board, stated that he also will vote
to sustain all registrars who require
women registrants to tell their ages.
Just the mere statement that they are
over twenty-one years of age will not
suffice,&quot; Mr. Clements said. &quot;The
women now have got into politics
and they must be reconciled to complying with all of the requirements,&quot;
Mr.  Clements said.
To Sustain Registrars.
Captain Mitchell Long, third mem-
ber of the election board, stated that
he would vote with the other members of the election commission to
sustain registrars in this matter. So
that makes the board unanimous.
The question of requiring women
to tell their ages as a pre-requisite
to registering arose this morning 
when one of the registrars who had 
been sworn in took Captain Long
aside and questioned him about as
follows: &quot;What are we going to do
about these women refusing to tell
their ages?&quot; Captain Long told the
registrar that he would sustain him
in compelling such women to tell
their ages. The question seemed to
be settled when all of the members
of the commission fell in line.
Registrars in the past have reported to the election commission that
many women would not tell their ages
further than to say they were over
twenty-one years old, and many
were allowed to register with this
limited  information.
The election commission was busy 
this morning swearing in registrars
from over the city and county. The
following oath was administered to
each.
&quot;I John Doe, do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully and impartially keep the register of voters
in my district, (or ward) that I will
not knowingly register or allow to
be registered, any person not a legally qualified voter, and that I will not
knowingly prevent any from registering who is a legally qualified voter,
so help  me God.
&quot;Signed. &quot;
Registration books in the city and
county precincts will be opened each
morning at 8 o'clock and will close
at 9 o'clock. It was stated this morning that no one will be permitted
to act as a registrar who has not
been duly sworn, but while sworn
registrars are supposed to stay with
their books, they may have clerks to
do the writing for them, if this will
facilitate registration. But no neglect
on the part of the registrars will be
tolerated, and they, being under oath
will be held responsible for any work
or action of a clerk or substitute.
The registrars for Knoxville and
Knox county appointed by the election commission and the places of
registration in the respective precincts follow:

<dc:description>They arose
in turn, and each was given a round
of applause.
 At   this     juncture     Representative
Joe Harris shouted, &quot;Let's go home.&quot;
Representative Joe Wade of Knox
county, was not content, however,
with a mere introduction, and insisted that he be permitted to speak.
He entered into an extended discussion of details incident to the consideration and enactment of the suffrage legislation. Three time's during his discourse Mrs. French sounded the gavel, as if to cut short the
speaker's time, but despite this he
continued
Commissioner Neal Adams, whom
Mr. Wade had put on the defensive,
was then introduced. He said he
went to Nashville in behalf of the city
park bill and the Victory Memorial
bill and the suffrage bill, and did all
he could in the interest of these.
&quot;What about your board bill?' exclaimed  a  legislator.
Representative Joe Harris, of Knox
spoke briefly, also having asked the
privilege  of  being  heard.
Representative Larson of Shelby,
was then called upon by Mrs. French
and in his speech he made especial
reference to the depricated possibility
of non-partisanism among women
voters, saying ihat every woman
should affiliate with one party or another.
This concluded the festivities, and
at 9:15 o'clock Mrs. French announced &quot;the meeting is adjourned sine
die.&quot;
Felicitating Mrs. French upon the
success of the occasion, one gentleman present remarked. &quot;You had a
good show and you made a splendid
ringmaster   Mrs.    French.&quot;
&quot;Ringmaster is right,&quot; replied the
veteran suffragist, who now demures
to that designation, affirming that
no longer is she a &quot;suffragist&quot; but
now is a  &quot;voter.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>SUFFRAGE VICTORY IS CELEBRATED;
WOMEN GIVE BANQUET TO SOLONS
WHO WERE RATIFICATION BOOSTERS
Senators and Representatives of Knox and Other East Tennessee
Counties Guests of Honor.—Mrs. George Fort Milton and Representative Harry Burn Deliver Chief Addresses.—Echoes From
Contest In Nashville, and History of Suffrage Movement is Reviewed.—Spirit of Political Alignments and Preferments Expected Among Women as Well as In Ranks of Men.-—Mrs. L. C.
French Toastmistress.
Now that they've got it what are
they going to do with it?
Such has been the query of many indifferent and the vitally opposed to
women's right to exercise the ballot.
But there is no doubt in the minds
of some women as to what they are
going to with it. Such were women
attending the &quot;Victory Banquet&quot;
given Tuesday evening at the Woman's building in special compliment
to the members of the legislature
from East Tennessee who cast their
votes for ratification at the recent
special session of the legislature.
&quot;The New Citizenship&quot; was the
keynote of the talks of the evening,
and each speaker referred to the new
freedom and emancipation of women
with its consequent responsibilities,
privileges and opportunities.
Mrs. L. C. French, who was identified with the suffrage struggle since
its inception in Tennessee, presided
as the toastmistress of the evening. Mrs. French was  attired in
black lace, and with this costume
wore a banner of yellow, purple and
white, the colors of the National
Woman's Party. She had worn this
banner on the occasion of her interview with Gov. Cox and Senator
Harding as a member of the committee of women selected by Miss Alice
Paul, national chairman of the woman's  party.
Senator Houk Speaks First
Shortly after the guests had been
seated at the tables, and while the
first course was being served, Mrs.
L. C. French, the toastmistress, announced that Senator John C. Houk
one of the guests of honor, must leave
the meeting early in the evening, and
therefore he would speak at this
time. Senator Houk, who was slightly indisposed, spoke briefly.
&quot;I have been in the midst of the
battle for the past ten years,&quot; he
said in referring to his efforts on behalf of the cause of women's suffrage. &quot;The proudest moments of
my life came when I wrote the suffrage plank in the progressive platform of 1912. I was laughed at then.
But this plank passed the republican
convention in 1916, four years before
it. was included in the democratic
platform in 1920. I have stood for
suffrage for ten years and I still
stand for it. I believe that if I had
not stood as firmly and as loyally
as I did stand, that it would not have
passed. If Senator Patton and I had
diverted our influence, the bill would
not have passed. It is the proudest
heritage that I have, that I have been
a factor in giving women the liberties
to which they were entitled. There
never was a man who could issue
an argument against woman suffrage.
A woman is a human being.&quot;
Senator Houk concluded his brief
talk with praise of &quot;Madame Catt&quot;
who is a national and international
figure, in the realms of suffrage.
Mrs. French Speaks
Mrs. French was the second speaker. &quot;Pioneers&quot;  was the general
theme of her talk in which she gave
unstinted praise to the work of Susan
B. Anthony, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw
Frances E. Willard, Mrs. Elizabeth
Lyle Saxon, of Memphis, and Mrs.
Lide Meriwether, of Memphis. Mrs.
French was generous in her praise
of the work of the W. C. T. U.
leaders, whom she said had been most
valuable exponents of suffrage as
they realized that they could attain
many of their desires through the
ballot. In speaking of Dr. Mary
Shaw, she remarked that she was the
greatest woman speaker she had ever heard, and had almost uncanny
powers of presiding over a mass
meeting, despite the fact that Mrs.
Shaw was no parliamentarian. &quot;I
never knew her to make a mistake.
I heard her and Mrs. Emmaline
Pankhurst on the same program one
evening, and both were mild, sweet,
charming, not hasty, and had tne
power of converting all who heard
them,&quot; said she.
Mrs. French concluded her talk
with references to anti-suffrage literature that had been sent her, which
she said she would distribute if there
was a request for it.
On a large purple and white banner
above Mrs. French was this legend:
&quot;The Immortals 25x50—1.&quot; Ex-
plained by Mrs. French this means
the twenty-five senators, the fifty
representatives in the lower house,
minus   Seth   Walker.
On a second banner hung below
this top streamer were printed the
names of Susan B. Anthony, Dr.
Anna   Howard   Shaw,     Frances     E.
Willard, Mrs. Lide Meriwether and
Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon, to which
Mrs. French also made fitting reference.
Harry T. Burn's Address.
Representative Harry T. Burn of
McMinn county, who changed his
vote in the final roll call, was by far
the most popular gentleman speaker
of the evening.
In presenting Mr. Burn, Mrs. French
said: &quot;I will now ask Mr. Burn to
tell us what he really got out of the
situation, as a result of casting his
vote for suffrage ratification.&quot;
In response, Mr. Burn stated that it
had indeed been a great privilege to
him finally to support suffrage, and
that he emerged from the fight with
a &quot;clear conscience.&quot; Continuing he
said:
&quot;To the chairman, and to the organizations represented, permit me to
say that I appreciate the honor you
do me by inviting me to be present
this evening.
&quot;And it is with much pleasure that
I salute those who have acquired 'The
New Citizenship' as 'Fellow citizens In
the truest sense!&quot;
&quot;The opportunity given the women
of America, of Tennessee, of Knox-
ville, and to the individual, to assist
in placing higher standards in the
political world, and to institute needed moral reforms, will not be neglected.
The interest being manifested
proves this assertion to be true.
Do not understand me to predict
great reforms as sweeping the country in a short period, but that with
tho ballot as a weapon the correcting
measures will gradually be applied
by the entire  citizenship, men and
women. 
'The credit for the great reform
that produces the opportunity for the
women to share her portion in the
struggles that will be fought by
means of the ballot, belongs to the
women themselves, and it is to them
that the suffrage service medal
should be given.
&quot;I am pleased that fate gave me an
opportunity to have a small part in
making Tennessee 'The Perfect 36th,'
but the fact should be recognized that
right ultimately triumphs and if Tennessee had not acted then some other
state woud have done so. To the
credit of the Volunteer States let it
be said that the majority of the men
in the governing body made of Tennessee a Guiding Star to the women
of America who were seeking political
freedom.
&quot;Since  'The New Citizenship' is the
attaining of political liberty, we may
expect personal, domestic, educational
and economic rights, for women, to
follow in rapid succession. These will
ultimately make this—world a better
place in which to live.
&quot;You all have heard the fear expressed that the good women will not
vote. Let me say that the women
will not, as they never have, endeavored to escape the performance of
duty and to vote is now a duty. And
the mothers will not cast their ballot
with only the present to be thought of
but for the good of coming generations as well.
Hopes For Better Schools.
&quot;If the new citizenship would result in only one thing—better schools,
then it would be worth while. Ignorance is what endangers America today. Proper education so that each
would understand would do much to
abolish the strife between capital and
labor, and solve many other troublesome problems. To those who claim
they fear that social legislation supported by the mothers of America will
cause unreasonable tax budgets, let
me say that the cost of saving American civilization for the world can
not be valued in dollars and cents.
&quot;There are many things I would
like to say to you but I have a motto
that I try to keep before me when attempting to talk to others; and that
motto is 'Waste not the time of others
by trying to tell them something they
already know.' [N]aturally, this motto
causes me to take very little of the
time of this audience!
&quot;I would enjoy telling you what I
see in the future of America because
of the influence for good that has
recently been liberated—for I am
somewhat of a dreamer—but the
problems that confront us are stern
facts; questions requiring an immediate answer; and I am confident
the   enlightened  womanhood  of Am-
erica are capable of giving the right
answer in each instance.
&quot;Therefore I would congratulate
you on the victory you have won and
for the great good you will do by being a part of the governing power it
this  great nation!&quot;
No Violation of Constitution
Dr. John R. Neal, of the faculty
of the college of law of the University
of Tennessee explained the legal aspect of the ratification of suffrage
saying that there was no violation
of the Tennessee constitution, as the
clause in the state constitution conflicted with a clause in the federal
constitution and was therefore automatically null and void as the federal
constitution has supremacy and cannot be overriden by a clause in a state
document.
In a facetous and very humorous
talk, Senator E. E. Patton, who is
one of the best friends the suffragists
have ever had, said that he'd just
like to have seen King Solomon in
these days of women's rights- &quot;Why,
with the votes of his thousand wives
he could have carried any convention
and could have elected all his candidates,&quot; he said. Later in his address he stated that ratification of
suffrage marked the wiping away of
one of the old landmarks of time
and opened the way for new visions,
new dreams and new realizations.
&quot;When I saw the tactics of some
of the suffragists a few years ago
in Washington, I wondered if suffrage
would be good for women. I had
favored giving them the vote, until
I saw these actions. Then I got to
thinking the matter over some more
and I decided that there was no reas-
on why all the women should be held
responsible for the acts of a few 
reckless women,&quot;  he  said.
Senator Patton gave a most inte- 
resting account of the tactics of the
anti-suffragists, speaking of their
ubiquitous press agent who he said,
knew all the news before it happened.
&quot;But right here I want to say that
I have never seen a group of women
who were more modest, tactful and
well behaved than the group or suffrage workers who attended the special session of the legislature in
Nashville,&quot; said he.
Mrs. George F- Milton a Speaker
Mrs. George F. Milton, president
of the League of Women Voters, for
the stato, was one of the very popular
speakers of the evening. She told 
of the manner in which women were 
receiving the vote, and hinted at some
of the things they meant to accomplish in the first few years of tneir
new citizenship.
Mrs.   Milton praised the efforts of
the  legislators in  behalf of suffrage.
Her address is printed in  full elsewhere.
Defends Women Lobbyists
Mrs. Chas. A. Weaver spoke of the
women lobbyists at Nashville. &quot;They
were mothers seeking better protection for their children,&quot; she
said. &quot;Some of them were school
teachers and interested in a movement for better schools. Then
there were business women who said
they wanted the ballot to improve
working conditions for women. They
were the highest type of women.&quot;
Miss Kate White, recently retired
president of the Woman's Building
board, Mrs. T. P. Miller, chairman
of the Non-Partisan League. Mrs.
J. S. Craft, of the W. C. T.U., and
Mrs. Martha Baker of the Business
and Professional Women's club each
spoke briefly, giving an idea of what
the members of their respective organizations expected to accomplish
with the judicious use of the ballot.
Miss Mamie Harrigan presdient (sic.) of
the Newman Circle spoke for her
organization, whose members have
been active in the interest of suffrage.
For Knox County Women
Mrs. French announced that the
lady who had been asked to speak
for the democratic women of Knox
county had just informed her that
&quot;she is too timid to speak.&quot; Whereupon Mrs. French called upon Mrs
Eleanor Albers Phillips of Memphis,
a former Knox county woman, to
speak to this subject. Mrs. Phillips
made an interesting talk, in which
she credited the democratic party 
with the suffrage victory, and also
spoke of party affiliations among
women as well as among men as being a logical consequence of suffrage.
Frank L. West, county tax assessor, was introduced to speak for
the republican women of the county.
He took issue with Mrs. Phillips as
to the credit belonging to the democracy for the suffrage victory in
Tennessee. He related that when he
was in the state legislature he had
introduced measures looking to enfranchisement of women in this state
and that these measures had been
killed through aggressiveness of
democrats. He said it would have
been impossible for suffrage to have
won at Nashville in August without
the support of republicans, as too
many democrats opposed it.
Wade Had to be Heard
Mrs. French announced that it
would not be possible to call upon
each of the legislators to speak, although they were the guests of honor.
However, she said, they would be
formally presented to the assembly
if they would rise as their names
were called. She then recited
names of the gentlemen of the s[en]-
ate and house seated at a table
the  center  of the room.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fellow townsmen:  I know what it is to be called The A Y J 8 (??) on the other han(sic.) J I of the South.  I know what it is to have the moral support of Gov. (?), Pres. Candidates, Senators and the good citizens of my county.  I know what it is to displease capitalists, Wall St. and the Whiskey Ring of the North who would stoop to anything to ruin a man's character.  Regardless of your opinion on Suffrage...I appreciate more than anything else in the world the Loyalty of Niota the best town in the world in this great moral issue.   [Harry Burn]</dc:description>
