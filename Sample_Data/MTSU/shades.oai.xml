<dc:description>This landscape view of the Tennessee River at Knoxville is seen from a height in the vicinity of Fort Sanders or the University of Tennessee.  The completed railroad bridge confirms its post-Civil War date. Artist Flavius Fisher, who was born in Virginia and had grown up in East Tennessee, is known to have studied in Philadelphia until about 1850 and was working in Richmond by 1855. He is known to have painted one or more portraits in Knoxville in the 1850s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The McGavock Confederate Cemetery is the nation's largest private Confederate cemetery. Located on 2 acres of the Carnton plantation in Franklin, Tennessee, the cemetery is the burial site for 1481 Confederates killed at the Battle of Franklin. (Carnton served as a field hospital during the 1864 Battle.) Residents John and Carrie McGavock's concern for the remains led to the setting aside of the land and the reinterment of the soldiers in 1866.</dc:description>

<dc:date>1866</dc:date>
<dc:format>28.25 x 20.25 in.</dc:format>
<dc:description>This is the left hand portion of a triptych showing an African American man in the same location at three stages of his military career. Here, he doffs his hat in greeting as he stands outside of the Provost Marshall's Office.  In the background is a U.S. flag, drum, a new rifle with bayonette, and a newspaper lying on a chair.  The man carries a knapsack on a stick and has dried tobacco leaves stuffed in his pocket. His clothes are rumpled.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This series of three paintings by Thomas Waterman Wood, created in 1866, depicts the progression of an ex-slave from his enlistment in the Union army to his return as a wounded veteran. Wood, who was living in Nashville in 1862, moved to Louisville in neutral Kentucky for the remainder of the war.  His dignified and sympathetic portrayals of African Americans working in the fields or accepting new responsibilities prior to and immediately after the war are so unusual as to become political statements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This illustration by &quot;Special Artist&quot; Alfred R. Waud, depicts events occuring at the Battle above the Clouds. On November 25, 1863 Union forces under Generals Sherman, Thomas and Hooker attacked Confederate General Braxton Bragg's troops at Missionary Ridge along Lookout Mountain near Chattanooga.  Sherman was out maneuvered by Confederate General Patrick Cleburne but later support from General Thomas carried the day. Artists like Waud could get closer to the battle than photographers, who were limited by their bulky equipment.</dc:description>

Grant, Federal volunteers scaled the cliffs of the Palisades, found the Confederates had withdrawn, and claimed Lookout Mountain. The rock was named after U. S. Sergeant Roper, who fell to his death there.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gilbert Gaul, 1855-1919, who received his artistic training at the National Academy of Design, inherited a farm in Van Buren County, Tennessee in 1881. Gaul built a log residence and studio on this land where he lived until 1885. Gaul spent time in Tennessee from 1891 to 1895 and in 1905 began teaching at Watkins Institute in Nashville. In the 1880s, he began to do works commemorating the Civil War, many of which found enthusiastic patrons.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Gutherz, Carl</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1875</dc:date>
<dc:description>Man is seated in a cushioned, ornate wooden chair.  He wears a suit with a watch fob.  In his lap, he holds what appears to be a book and a sharpening tool.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Carl Gutherz (1844-1907) arrived in Memphis at the age of 16 with his family in 1860.  While Carl never served in the Civil War, he found work as a draftsman for a Memphis arms foundry and is reported to have smuggled contraband for the Confederate troops. In 1870, Gutherz studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  Upon his return to the United States he became an art instructor in St. Louis, helping to establish the St. Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts.  During his second tenure in Paris (1884–1896) he attended the Académie Julian.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Battle of Stones River near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, took place around dawn on December 31, 1862 and on and off through January 2, 1863. Much of it centered in the Round Forest area, which would become the site for Hazen’s Monument, one of the earliest Civil War memorials to be built on a battlefield. While considered by many to be a draw, General Bragg’s withdrawal allowed General Rosecrans to claim victory for the North. The timing was critical for the Union victory, as northern morale was low in the days following a disastrous loss at Fredericksburg, Virginia.  This important Confederate defeat also reinforced the promise and raised hopes for President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation issued on 1 January 1863.</dc:description>

General Grant seized Brown’s Ferry as well as Wauhatchie, opening up a supply line to the beleaguered Union troops. General Hooker then attacked Lookout Mountain in what became known as &quot;The Battle above the Clouds” on November 25.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Union and Confederate veterans of the Civil War began to hold separate reunions as early as the 1870s and by 1890 were organizing joint &quot;Blue and Gray&quot; events.  Much of the impetus for these events was the economic recovery of the war torn country.  Sheet music like Butler's &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; was created to support the country's healing process and appeal to the large numbers of veterans of the war.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two men seated on camp stools face each other in a tent-like area, smoking. Both men wear coats, light-colored trousers, and knee-high leather boots.  At upper right is a series of holes, possibly bullet holes. Card is signed on reverse: &quot;Very Truly Yours, James Walker.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>James Walker (1819-1889) and Theodore R. Davis (1840-1894) were &quot;Special Artists&quot; for news magazines such as Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly, illustrating activities at the front. This carte-de-visite is thought to have been made in Chattanooga. While their images were published contemporaneously with the events they depicted, both men are also known to have created later works of art based on their war-time experiences.  </dc:description>

<dc:description>Cover depicts fallen drummer boy surrounded by mourning comrades and other casualties as the Battle of Shiloh rages. Cover image has only sepia tint.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Drummer Boy of Shiloh was a song written for Harpers Weekly magazine by William S. Hays following the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. The inspiration for drummer boy Johnny Shiloh may have been John Lincoln Clem who served with distinction in the Battle of Chickamauga at the age of 12 and was promoted for his bravery. While it is unlikely that Clem served at Shiloh, many young boys did serve as musicians on the battlefield, leading troops into and out of the fighting.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Stones River Battlefield, Hazen Brigade Monument</dc:title>
<dc:date>2003</dc:date>
<dc:description>A rectagular stone monument and tombstones are enclosed by a stone wall. Trees and grass surround the area.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Hazen's Brigade Monument stands in the midst of one of the first official Civil War graveyards, which was built on the battlefield soon after the battle of Stones River. Named after William Babcock Hazen (1830-1887), a West Point graduate who commanded the unit, it is believed to be the oldest intact Civil War monument. Built on the defense line held by the troops on December 31, 1862, the monument's location was selected by Captain A. Johnson of the 9th Indiana Infantry to honor those men of the 9th who held the crest. Hazen's Brigade also figured in the January 2 fighting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ten-year-old drummer John Lincoln Clem, of Newark, Ohio, became famous as &quot;Johnny Shiloh&quot; after he was reputed to have survived a shrapnel shell during the Battle of Shiloh. While scholars have been unable to place Clem at Shiloh, he did serve at Chickamauga and was wounded in Atlanta. After the war, President Grant appointed him to the regular army, in which he rose to the rank of Colonel, before retiring in 1903.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1888, Thomas Green Ryman commissioned construction of the Union Gospel Tabernacle so that Nashville would have an appropriate venue for the popular evangelical gatherings of the time. A balcony added in 1897, was funded in part by the United Confederate Veterans to accommodate a reunion of their members during the Tennessee Centennial Exposition (Ryman himself never served in the war). The Tabernacle served as their headquarters during the June 1897 three-day reunion and was the starting point for a parade through Nashville. In honor of their support, the Tabernacle's trustees named the addition, &quot;The Confederate Gallery.&quot; In 1904, the hall, by then used primarily for concerts and soon to become the first home of the Grand Ole Opry, was re-named the Ryman Auditorium.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Chattanooga Cordially Invites You to a Barbeque at Crawfish Springs, Walker County, Georgia September 20, 1889</dc:title>
<dc:title>Invitation to Barbeque Dedication of Chickamauga National Battlefield Park</dc:title>
<dc:date>1889</dc:date>
<dc:description>Several vignettes showing a uniformed Union and Confederate veteran preparing for a barbeque by selecting a pig and building a fire. Crossed pipes with the letters &quot;CV&quot; and &quot;A of C&quot; frame a scene with a train crossing an elevated track over a river with a waterwheel. The stars and stripes appears at left.  Two crawfish appear above text at bottom.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This barbeque, held at Crawfish Springs, Georgia, near Chattanooga, Tennessee, was the first joint Blue-Gray reunion organized in Tennessee. Veterans of the Army of the Cumberland, led during the war by Confederate General Rosecrans, reunited with Union soldiers near the site of the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1889. In 1890, Chickamauga was appropriated $325,000 as the first American battlefield to be preserved by Congress. The development of the area, including rail infrastructure, made the location, then called Crawfish Springs, an accessible and pleasant vacation spot.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This novel, written by Major W.D. Reynolds, tells the story of Susan's reputed saving of the U.S. flag which was flying over the home of her father, William Gannaway &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow while Knoxville was controlled by the Confederates. Reynolds uses a pseudonym for Susan--Martha--possibly to protect her identity. Susan and her father travelled during the war selling their novels (he had his own) and making speeches about the defiant Unionists living in East Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mansion facing on gardens landscaped in three circular sections with pathways and plantings. One circle surrounds a fountain,  one a gazebo, and the other a flower garden. Four additional gazebos flank the house and grounds.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Architect and engineer Adolphus Heiman oversaw the remodeling and additions to this Italinate house just prior to the Civil War. The formal geometric gardens of Belmont are designed to complement the lines of the home.  Typically, the decorative gardens of a large home were used as an approach in the front of the house, encouraging visitors to admire the building, and functional vegetable, herb and cutting gardens were placed in the rear of the building.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Gay Street, Knoxville, Tenn. 1861</dc:title>
<dc:title>Simultaneous Recruiting for Confederate and Union Armies on Gay Street, 1861</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1863</dc:date>
<dc:description>This drawing depicts a crowd gathered on Gay Street in Knoxville, Tennessee for the purposes of recruiting Union and Confederate soldiers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The personal art of soldiers reveals not only their skills at carving or drawing but also what they felt most important to communicate. This drawing, which Palmer completed in 1863 while imprisoned at Camp Douglas, near Chicago, gives a vivid sense of how evenly split loyalties were in the city of Knoxville right after the secession vote, June 8, 1861, when a majority of Tennesseans voted to join the Confederacy.  A Confederate training camp was set up across from Old Gray cemetery and 400 soldiers were housed in Knoxville. Although young men in rural sections of East Tennessee were more likely to be Union loyalists, Palmer and others like him in the cities joined many sons of wealthy and prominent families, such as the McClung and Ramsey families in Knoxville, in signing up for the Confederacy. Many Confederate soldiers set down images of their war experiences, sent home illustrated letters, and kept journals. So also did Union troops, many of whom had never before ventured south.</dc:description>

<dc:description>One of a pair of portraits (with Robert E. Lee) that may have been created in Clarksville, Tennessee after the Civil War. The other pair is in a private collection that originated in Clarksville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This portrait of Confederate General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (1824-1863) has been attributed to artist Robert Loftin Newman, a Virginian who had a studio in Clarksville, Tennessee in 1858. Newman served in the Confederate Army, returning to Tennessee after the war before moving to New York City for the remainder of his life. These are among his only known Civil War themed works. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Maria Howard Weeden, 1846-1905, was born in Huntsville, Alabama. She developed her natural artistic abilities while attending Tuskegee Female Methodist College just after the Civil War. Weeden, best known for her sympathetic images of former slaves, also spent time in Tennessee. This portrait is of Emmanuel Washington, who remained at Wessyngton in Cedar Hill, Tennessee after the Civil War where he was employed as a cook for the Washington family.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army with offices based at 89 Church Street in Nashville beginning in December 1863. Nashville had been captured by Federal troops in February of 1862 and Chattanooga had fallen in November 1863. Barnard traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. His focus in his work was the locations of strategic interest to the military: railroads, bridges and battlefields. Between January and September of 1864 Nashville was the scene of great activity as approximately 140,000 troops and immense amounts of supplies passed through the city as the Federal campaign moved south.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lotz designed and built this house, which is located across the street from the brick home of Fountain Branch Carter. Lotz, a skilled carpenter and German immigrant, created furniture for the home interior and for many patrons in the area prior to the Civil War. During the Battle of Franklin, 30 November 1864, Lotz and his family took shelter at the Carter house. His house survived with surprisingly little damage.</dc:description>

<dc:title>United States Brigade Flag</dc:title>
<dc:description>The flag appears to have been trimmed, particularly in the blue field and the border areas, with possible portions taken as souvenirs. The fabric is faded, particularly the red and white stripes. It has a blue field with gold stars and a fringe border.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Antoinette Polk, daughter of Andrew Jackson Polk of Ashwood Hall, was sixteen years old and visiting her cousins in Columbia when she heard that Union Gen. John T. Wilder’s “Lightning Brigade” was approaching. Knowing that there were Confederate soldiers recuperating at her home, she jumped on her horse and raced home in time to warn the soldiers. When Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest heard of Antoinette’s bravery, he gave her this banner captured from Union Gen. Abel Streight’s Brigade in May 1864.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Susan Penniman Dickinson</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1855</dc:date>
<dc:description>The portrait shows a seated woman with a red drape at left and a house at right. She appears to be in young middle age and wears a cameo and lace collar and cuffs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This painting portrays Susan Penniman Dickinson, a native of Massachusetts, was married Perez Dickinson in Suffolk County, Massachusetts in 1845. The house in downtown Knoxville where they most likely lived with Dickinson's  brother-in-law James Estabrook and his family appears to be shown in the background. This may be a posthumous portrait. Susan Penniman Dickinson died in 1846. Dickinson purchased the house from Estabrook in 1851. The portraitist, Flavius Fisher, who had grown up in East Tennessee, is known to have studied in Philadelphia until about 1850 and was working in Richmond by 1855.  His crayon drawing of Annie White, Dickinson's niece, is thought to have been made about 1857.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Wood, Thomas Waterman (1823-1903)</dc:creator>
<dc:title>A Southern Cornfield, Nashville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:date>1861</dc:date>
<dc:format>28 x 40 inches</dc:format>
<dc:description>This painting depicts eight African Americans of varying ages working in a field of corn, probably under a hot June sun. The moment shown appears to be a break for water.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Thomas Waterman Wood, a native of Vermont, trained as an artist in Boston and New York and traveled in Europe before settling in Nashville in 1859. He was drawn to the cosmopolitan southern city by the promise of portrait commissions, but he undertook this genre painting, for which he hired models, on his own. He left Nashville in 1862 for Louisville, Kentucky.  What he had seen of African American life must have fascinated him, for he soon undertook a series of paintings that chronicled the transition from slavery to citizenship.</dc:description>

<dc:title>In the Tennessee Mountains, 1887</dc:title>
<dc:date>1887</dc:date>
<dc:description>It depicts a late summer scene in which an elderly woman standing in a garden leaning on a hoe. In the garden are cabbages and tomatoes, a shock of corn stalks is visible at the edge of the garden where there are also flowers blooming. There are two cabins in the background, one of which appears to be in deteriorating condition.</dc:description>
<dc:description>George W. Chambers (b. 1857) taught in Nashville at the Watkins Institute beginning in 1885 and at the Nashville School of Art in the 1890s. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Chambers had studied under Carl Gutherz  (1844-1907) at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts and under Jean Leon Gerome in Paris in 1880.
He may have known Gilbert Gaul (1855-1917) who was living in Van Buren County in the 1880s on an inherited farm with outbuildings of a similar design to those in this painting. Cabbages were an important crop for 19th century farmers and were a particular staple of Americans of German descent, who used the vegetable in cooking and pickling. Flowers around the perimeter of the garden were planted to attract useful bees. In the background a pumpkin is visible, set against the fence to support its massive vines.  The time of year is probably mid to late fall based on the size of the pumpkin.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This house was built in 1837 for Leonidas Polk, later known as the &quot;Fighting Bishop&quot; of the Confederacy. Trained at West Point, he entered the ministry and moved with his family to Louisiana in 1841 after his appointment as the Bishop of the Southwest Territory.

<dc:title>Governor William Gannaway Brownlow</dc:title>
<dc:date>1866</dc:date>
<dc:description>Full length portrait of William G. Brownlow standing in front of a red chair while gesturing toward the United States flag.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Professional artists dependent upon wealthy patrons risked losing business as a result of partisan attitudes. Some left Tennessee, moving either north or further south to avoid having to take sides publicly.Those who stayed carefully toed the line of neutrality, like painter-photographer George Dury, who painted figures from both sides of the war. The Reconstruction Legislature also funded the bust-length portrait of President Abraham Lincoln. Dury was paid $1,000 for the portrait of Brownlow and $225 for the portrait of Lincoln. Both portraits hung in the Tennessee State Capitol. During the Civil War period, Dury also painted Jefferson Davis, Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard [CSA], Gen. William Rosecrans [USA], Gen. George Thomas [USA], and Andrew Johnson.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Nashville, Tenn., March 1864 From Fort Negley Looking North East</dc:title>
<dc:title>Fort Negley</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864-03</dc:date>
<dc:description>This panoramic photograph taken from an upper level of the fort shows log construction, earth walls reinforced with stone, and bunker-like structures, as well as uniformed Union soldiers, tents, cannons, and a look out tower. In the distance are low tree-covered hills and a few scattered houses across a relatively flat landscape.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. Fort Negley, a star-shaped fortification, was designed by Army of the Ohio chief engineer James St. Clair Morton and constructed largely by African Americans, both freedmen and conscripted labor. The fort overlooked the junction of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and the Tennessee and Allatoona Railroad. Barnard later made single views of Fort Negely and the capitol.</dc:description>

<dc:date>1864-03-19</dc:date>
<dc:description>Panoramic view from the cupola of East Tennessee University looking East toward the Holston (Tennessee) River with notes on the locations of Forts Stanley, Higley, Dickinson; Battery Noble; and Second Creek.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. This 360 degree photograph was taken on March 19, 1864 by Barnard with the help of Captain Orlando M. Poe. The unusual exposure required the use of seven photographic plates and probably took the two much of the day to complete. Note how few clouds are visible. Because the exposure required to document the landscape usually overexposed the sky, few clouds are visible in most wet plate negatives. In 1866, Barnard would return to Tennessee to document Sherman's earlier campaign for a book. At that time, he took multiple images of the scenes to allow for more detailed views of the sky.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Alexander Simplot, 1837-1914, was a &quot;special artist&quot; who traveled with Union forces from 1861-1863. The painting shows a Union ironclad Monarch, one of five in the battle, in the foreground firing on Confederate Beauregard, which was a remodeled steamboat with cannons on the open-deck. Of the eight Confederate steamboats, all but one was lost. A pencil sketch of this naval battle, also by Simplot, was reproduced as an engraving in Harper's Weekly 28 June 1862.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. Chattanooga had been captured by Federal troops in November 1863. Captain Orlando M. Poe sent Barnard to Chattanooga in early February 1864 to photograph railroads, battlefields and the area around Lookout Mountain. He was there for about a week, February 5-12, 1864. The images would be used to create maps and plan for William T. Sherman's Georgia campaign. Barnard's photographs are characterized by a spare elegance.  Note the seated figure at the far right, a device that Barnard frequently employed to suggest scale.</dc:description>

<dc:date>1874</dc:date>
<dc:format>13 x 30 feet</dc:format>
<dc:description>This painting shows troops in the foreground massed on a plain below a mountain with some cloud cover. At the base of the mountain, troops can be seen charging forward and clouds of smoke from gun and cannon fire can be seen across the horizon.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Englishman James Walker, 1819-1889, was living in Mexico City during the U.S. - Mexican War and later did a series of panoramic paintings depicting it. He created works during and after the Civil War, including several versions of the Battle of Lookout Mountain. A smaller version, done in 1864, was commissioned by Gen. Joseph Hooker, U.S.A., who is depicted on the white horse at left. Artists like Walker created and often travelled large show piece works like this one to satisfy public audiences in the decades following the war.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Polk Place Interior</dc:title>
<dc:title>Hallway or Corridor in Polk Place</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows what appears to be a hallway or corridor leading into the large room depicted in the other photograph taken at the same time. It appears cluttered and possibly underkept, indicating it may have been taken in the later years of her life.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Polk Place, on Capitol Hill, was remodeled by President and Mrs. James K. Polk to serve as a retirement residence after he left Washington when his term concluded in 1848. Polk died 15 June 1849. His portrait is visible in this photograph at right. Sarah Childress Polk resided at Polk Place during the Civil War and continued to live in the home until her death on 14 August 1891. She remained publicly neutral during the war and was known for her hospitality. The layout of the painting on the left wall suggests that this might be the reception room in Polk Place, as shown in the 1880 Frank Leslie's newspaper image shown in this section.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of Mrs. James K. Polk</dc:title>
<dc:title>Sarah Childress Polk</dc:title>

<dc:description>Mrs. Polk is facing her left wearing a red off the shoulder gown and a tassel-like hair ornament. She is posed in front of a landscape seated in a red chair with a wood frame. There is what appears to be a brown curtain at left.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Sarah Childress was raised in Rutherford County, near Murfreesboro, the daughter of a successful merchant, tavern keeper, and land speculator. Sarah and her sister were educated at the Daniel Elam School and were tutored by the principal of the Bradley Academy, and so their instruction was on a level with that given to boys. At around age 12 the girls were sent to Nashville's Abercrombie School and then finished their education at the Moravian Female Academy in what is now Winston-Salem. The James K. Polk Ancestral Home has a lovely piece of needlework that Sarah completed while in school. After returning to Murfreesboro, Sarah married James K. Polk on January 1, 1824. Sarah supported her husband by accompanying him to Washington on almost every occasion and by highlighting interesting articles in the newspapers for him to read. During Polk's four years as president, 1844-1848, Sarah opened the White House twice weekly to the public. George Peter Alexander Healy, 1813-1894, painted this image of Mrs. Polk, one of a pair of portraits, while President Polk was in office. The paintings, along with furnishings used by the Polks at the White House and later at Polk Place, were donated to the ancestral home of James K. Polk by Mrs. Polk's niece.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In Tennessee, many sons of prominent Tennessee families had prepared for life as professional soldiers by attending military preparatory academies or obtaining commissions to West Point. When war was declared, they were automatically given rank in whichever army they chose to join. Those who trained at West Point had studied engineering and historical military tactics. The Union army purposely recruited skilled tradesmen into the Corps of Engineers to help build bridges, buildings, boats, and fortifications. Plans from both sides for fortifications and detailed maps and drawings have survived. Much of the military strategy targeted railroads and rivers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Head and shoulders photograph of a young man wearing a shirt and tie and a jacket with fur collar and soft beret-type hat with ribbon. He is facing to his right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Theodore R. Davis (1840-1894) was a special artist who travelled to the battle front to sketch scenes which were sent back to New York for conversion to engravings for Harper's Weekly. Over the course of the war, Davis travelled around the South and is known to have been in Memphis in 1861; he was present with Union forces at Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain in 1863; and then was in Knoxville as he prepared to travel with Sherman on his march to Atlanta. Over 250 of the sketches he created on site were published in Harpers Weekly. After the war, Davis produced more finished paintings of Civil War scenes and consulted on the cyclorama of Atlanta.

<dc:description>Professional artists dependent upon wealthy patrons risked losing business as a result of partisan attitudes. Some left Tennessee, moving either north or further south to avoid having to take sides publicly.Those who stayed carefully toed the line of neutrality, like painter-photographer George Dury, who painted figures from both sides of the war. The Reconstruction Legislature, also known as the Brownlow Legislature, also commissioned a full-length portrait of Gov. William G. Brownlow from Dury.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Barker Walking Cane</dc:title>
<dc:title>Barton Barker Walking Stick, 3rd TN US</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1890</dc:date>
<dc:description>This carved wooden walking stick contains decorations including an eagle, a shield, and a star.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This folk art walking stick was carved by Union veteran Barton L. Barker, possibly from wood procured near the battlefield at Chattanooga. Soldiers often brought home souvenirs from the war such as samples of a captured flag as mementos of their experience. Like the flag, the eagle, shield and star were recognized symbols during the period of the war.  The Union shield was symbolic of unity, the desire to preserve the union. Stars often symbolized states (Confederate flags can often be dated by the number of stars in the upper register). The eagle,  adopted as the national symbol by Congress in the eighteenth century, was often depicted on Federal drums that led men into battle during the Civil War.  Barton Barker served in the 3rd Tennessee Infantry from 1862-1865. He moved to Chattanooga after the war and was active in the Lookout Mountain Post of the Grand Army of the Republic as proud of his membership in the Union Veterans League, since that was reserved for men who had enlisted in the federal army prior to the draft of July 1863.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Bleak House Tower Drawings</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1863</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait sketches of two bearded men and one youth.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This drawing, found on the interior plaster wall of the tower of Bleak House--Confederate Memorial Hall on Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee, is purported to represent three Confederate sharpshooters who killed Union General William P. Sanders on the afternoon of November 17, 1863 as he accompanied soldiers marching up Kingston Pike. The central figure has been identified as Corporal William Raines, 9th Georgia unit. During the siege of Knoxville, Bleak House was being used as Confederate General James Longstreet's headquarters. The home's residents, Louisa Franklin Armstrong and  her daughters, remained in second floor quarters, emerging for meals during periods when hostilities allowed.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Confederate Memorial Hall</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1854-1858</dc:date>
<dc:description>Antebellum Italian revival house on landscaped grounds, Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Bleak House, the home of Robert Houston and Louisa Franklin Armstrong, was one of several fashionable houses of wealthy Knoxvillians built just before the Civil War. Armstrong and other prominent Unionists (such as Perez Dickinson and John J. Craig, who also owned homes of a similar Italianate style), left the city in the early years of the war. Louisa Franklin Armstrong remained in Knoxville and her home was used as the headquarters for Confederate generals James Longstreet and Lafayette McLaws during the 1863 &quot;Siege of Knoxville.&quot; On November 18, 1863, Union General William P. Sanders was shot and killed, reputedly by sharpshooters located in the tower. Charcoal drawings of the faces of three men, apparently sketched by federal soldiers,  can be found today on the north wall of the tower's interior. Both Confederate and Union veterans visited Bleak House, now a museum called Confederate Memorial Hall, during Civil War reunions.</dc:description>

<dc:date>1868</dc:date>
<dc:description>This image depicts a row of buildings with a continuous long porch that appears to be a destination for people of all ages walking, running, and riding in a carriage. The building appears to be in a fenced complex, behind which can be seen a city view houses, other structures, and a smoke stack.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Fisk Free Colored School was founded in 1866 on the site of the former Federal Fort Gillem. The barracks were used as university buildings until replaced by more permanent structures. The school was named after General Clinton Bowen Fisk who arrived with Union occupying forces in Nashville in 1862. Enrollment topped 900 students in the first year and, in 1867, the school was incorporated as Fisk University. One of the original barracks buildings remains in use today as the Little Theatre.  </dc:description>

<dc:description>Panoramic view of railroad bridge and encampment outside of Chattanooga. Col. James Whiteside was a Chattanooga industrialist and one of the main supporters of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, which was completed in 1854. Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. Captain Orlando M. Poe had sent Barnard to Chattanooga in early February 1864 to document the landscape, during which time he focused on railroads, battlefields and on the Lookout Mountain area. The bridge near Whitesides was considered a highly strategic location.  The bridge had been constructed some months prior to this photograph by Federal army engineers. Note the defensive blockhouse in the foreground.</dc:description>

<dc:description>al Note:Susan Brownlow, the daughter of newspaper editor and Unionist William Gannaway &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow, lived in Knoxville during the war. She is reputed to have defied Confederate soldiers by displaying a United States flag. New York-born Matthew Brady, who took this portrait, studied under painter William Page and later under artist and inventor Samuel F.B. Morse at the National Academy of Design. There, Brady was introduced to the daguerreotype and he soon opened his own photography studio. Brady later became famous for his photographs of the Civil War.

<dc:description>Rural landscape with railroad tracks, telegraph poles, and small depot with &quot;Cemetery&quot; sign. Sign pointing to McFadden's Ford at right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Soon after the Civil War, the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad established a station stop at Stones River National Cemetery, begun in 1865 on former battlefield land to hold the remains of over 6000 Union casualties. United States Colored Troops, many from the 111th Regiment, were assigned to collect  bodies from the surrounding region, transport them by railroad whenever possible, and reinter them in neat rows under the supervision of Chaplain Earnshaw. By providing direct access to the cemetery at Stones  River, the N&amp;C  was one of the first railroads to facilitate commemorative pilgrimages to Civil War cemetery and battlefield locations in the ensuing decades.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Robert Loftin Newman</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1900</dc:date>
<dc:description>Photograph of an elderly gentleman dressed in formal attire, leaning on a cane, and standing in a room next to a table containing stacks of books. Inscribed below the photograph: &quot;R.L. Newman 1827&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>Artist Robert Loftin Newman, originally from Virginia, lived in Clarksville, Tennessee, maintaining a portraiture practice prior to the Civil War. Hoping to serve as a &quot;special artist&quot;  with the Confederate army, he enlisted but was informed that all able-bodied men were needed so he served for a period as a regular soldier. At war's end, Newman opened a studio in Nashville, hoping to make a living teaching students and attracting clients among ex-Confederates. While the studio was apparently short-lived, several related pairs of commemorative portraits of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson have been attributed to Newman, possibly from this period. For the remainder of his career, he lived and worked in New York City, painting religious and mythological scenes.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Carte-de-visite of Captain William Driver</dc:title>
<dc:title>Driver, William</dc:title>
<dc:description>Studio photograph of a man seated in ornate carved chair. &quot;Old Glory&quot; inscribed in border below.</dc:description>
<dc:description>William Driver, retired New England sea captain, owned the U.S. flag now known as &quot;Old Glory.&quot; It was raised over the state capitol  in February 1862 soon after Union soldiers entered Nashville.
 
Captain William Driver (1804-1886) was noted as a sea captain for having saved the descendents of the Bounty mutineers in in 1831, transporting them back to their home on Pitcairn's Island from Tahiti, where they had been living temporarily for six months because of a drought. Driver's family had made a flag for him to fly on the first ship he captained in 1824. He named it &quot;Old Glory.&quot; After he retired from the sea and moved to Nashville, about 1837, he flew the flag regularly once or twice a year. During the Civil War, it was sewn into a quilt to hide it from the Confederate army. After the war, Driver continued to fly the flag on special occasions and earned himself the nickname of 'Old Glory Driver.' This is probably what the inscription on the carte-de-visite refers to.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This photograph shows a large room with many pieces of furniture and a wood stove. It appears cluttered and possibly underkept, indicating it may have been taken in the later years of her life.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Polk Place, on Capitol Hill, was remodeled by President and Mrs. James K. Polk to serve as a retirement residence after he left Washington when his term concluded in 1848. Polk died 15 June 1849. His portrait is visible in this photograph at right rear. Sarah Childress Polk resided at Polk Place during the Civil War and continued to live in the home until her death on 14 August 1891. She remained publicly neutral during the war and was known for her hospitality.</dc:description>

<dc:date>circa 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait of a middle aged man with reddish brown hair and side whiskers dressed in formal clothing, seated in a red chair, and posed against a column base to his left.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Joseph Alexander Mabry, Jr. (1826-1882), a wealthy Knoxvillian who outfitted a Confederate regiment at the start of the Civil War, swore an oath of loyalty to the Union after federal troops occupied the city. Founder of the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad, Mabry was first and foremost a businessman. He had substantial landholdings in and around Knoxville. His fashionable country house on the outskirts of the city's east side proved a strategic location. Mabry's Hill was fortified during the war and used by both sides. Artist Samuel Shaver moved to Knoxville in 1859. He is known to have painted portraits of a number of distinguished East Tennessee individuals. Here he portrays Mabry has a man of means in an iconic pose with the trappings of wealth.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Slight overlap on scans.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This is the center left portion of the four-part photograph. It was taken from across a river and shows what appear to be farm fields extending down to the river, with some industrial outbuildings near the river. These fields are bounded on their upper edge by a road.  A substantial white house with multi-leveled rooftops sits on the opposite side of the road at upper right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Theodore M. Schleier (1832-1908), a photographer born in Prussia, is known to have worked in Nashville during the period from 1859-1869 and in Knoxville during the 1870s and 1880s. In 1862, he married Caroline Knaffl, whose brothers ran a photography studio in Knoxville. Schleier's studio imprint, which indicated studio locations in Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, can be found on cartes-de-visite produced during the Civil War, including  portrait photographs of officers in the 1st United States Colored Troops Heavy Artillery, which was organized in Knoxville in 1864. This portion of Schleier's Knoxville panorama, taken from the south side of the Holston (Tennessee) River  shows a section of farmlands and riverside buildings between East Tennessee University and downtown Knoxville.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is the center right portion of a four part panorama. It shows what appears to be the main business district of a city, with several multi-story brick warehouses fronting a street at right. In the central portion, two church steeples are visible.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Theodore M. Schleier (1832-1908), a photographer born in Prussia, is known to have worked in Nashville during the period from 1859-1869 and in Knoxville during the 1870s and 1880s. In 1862, he married Caroline Knaffl, whose brothers ran a photography studio in Knoxville. Schleier's studio imprint, which indicated studio locations in Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, can be found on cartes-de-visite produced during the Civil War, including  portrait photographs of officers in the 1st United States Colored Troops Heavy Artillery, which was organized in Knoxville in 1864. This portion of Schleier's Knoxville panorama shows downtown Knoxville.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Four poster bed</dc:title>
<dc:title>Bed belonging to Lucy Virginia Smith French</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1855</dc:date>
<dc:description>Four columned wooden bed with canopy top, fancy scrollwork on head and footboards.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This four poster bed, signed &quot;C.Lee&quot; was probably made in New Orleans. It features column-shaped posts, a tall, triangular-shaped  headboard, a low footboard, and carved scrollwork detailing. The bed, which has descended in the family of Lucy Virginia Smith French, may have been at the French residence, Forest Home, in McMinnville, Tennessee, during the Civil War. French's fine embroidered quilt, made for Forest Home from silk acquired in New Orleans, may have graced the bed, which has a matching cradle. Lucy Virginia Smith French retreated to Beersheba Springs for solace during some of the many occupations of McMinnville. Initially a  Unionist, she was a reluctant Confederate whose anti-war sentiments filled the Civil War diaries she kept.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Jewelry, Sarah Childress Polk</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1850</dc:date>
<dc:description>Piece of metal jewelry shaped like a ribbon with a buckle closure.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Former First Lady Sarah Childress Polk wore mourning clothes from the time of her husband's death in 1849 until the end of her life. Upon James K. Polk's retirement to Nashville, the former President and his wife had moved into Polk Place, a prominent residence in the vicinity of Capitol Hill in downtown Nashville. After Polk's death, his widow Sarah remained in Nashville.  As the gracious hostess of the formerly grand Polk Place, she was honored by visits from officers on both sides of the conflict. This fancy brooch was a piece of Sarah Polk's jewelry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hand-drawn color map of the military prison at Johnson's Island in the bay of Sandusky, Ohio, where captured Confederate officers were held. Prison buildings and grounds are labeled. Drawn by Capt. J. T. Hogane, Topographical Engineer, C.S.A., Gen. M. Jeff Thompson's Division. In upper left corner: &quot;James S. Brown, Major 46th Regt. Tenn. Vol., Capt'd at Island No. 10 April 8, 1862 By Genl Popes command. Block 2, Mess 2, Room 1.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>Capt. James T. Hogane entered the service in August 1861. He was Brigade Engineer 1st District Missouri on staff of Brig. Gen. Thompson (&quot;Co. Sappers &amp; Miners&quot;). He was captured on March 1, 1862, at New Madrid, Missouri, and came to be confined at Johnson's Island. He evidently used his talents to draw maps of the prison for various soldiers, such as James S. Brown. His handiwork is also seen at the front of St. Clair Morgan's Autograph Album in TSLA's Samuel Dold Morgan Papers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>[Old Glory]</dc:title>
<dc:title>Flag Belonging to William Driver</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1865</dc:date>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a woman and a man of older middle age standing in front of a very large United States flag that appears to have been attached to the front of a  building. The building, perhaps their house, has wood siding, a central brick chimney and a white wooden picket fence. The flag has thirteen stripes and  five horizontal rows of stars, as well as a white anchor at lower right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>William Driver, a New England ship captain who had retired to Nashville before the Civil War, was  famous for having called his homemade ship's flag &quot;Old Glory&quot; on one of his legendary voyages. During the early days of the war, Driver hid the oversized flag, which his wife had re-sewn circa 1861 to hold thirty four stars after the admission of Kansas into the Union. Driver became famous once again when Union soldiers raised &quot;Old Glory&quot;over the Tennessee State Capitol to signal the arrival of federal forces on February 25, 1862.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Head and shoulders photographic portrait in black and white of Ochs at about age 65.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Adolph Ochs, who purchased a floundering Chattanooga newspaper in 1877, and parlayed his business success into the acquisition of the New York Times in 1896,  was one of many who seized opportunity during the post Civil War era in Chattanooga. Ochs, who was raised in Knoxville, had experienced life in that divided city during the war. Even though his father Julius had served in the Union army, his mother, Bertha Levy, who had grown up on a plantation in the Deep South, remained loyal to the Confederacy. In Chattanooga, Adolph Ochs became a prominent member of Chattanooga society, chairing one of the South's earliest Blue-Gray reunions and supporting the formation of the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Battlefield Park as well as taking a leadership role by purchasing land to preserve Point Park. A Civil War museum bearing his name stands in the park today. </dc:description>

<dc:title>Samuel Dold Morgan</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1860</dc:date>
<dc:description>This photograph appears to show a large portrait of an elderly gentleman in a three-piece suit, posed in front of a large fluted column base and leaning against a stone pedestal with one hand in his pocket, the other holding a pair of glasses. His walking stick is hooked on the pedestal and there is a landscape scene of a rock bluff and trees in the background.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Samuel Dold Morgan (1798-1880) was a prominent Nashville industrialist who served on the Building Commission for the Tennessee State Capitol. During the Civil War, he served as Tennessee's Chairman of the Central Bureau of Military Supplies and also manufactured percussion caps for the Confederate army. He lost two of his sons in the war: Samuel Morgan Jr., and St. Clair McIntosh Morgan, a former West Point cadet married Ida Percy Pope, daughter of John Pope of Memphis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of Genevieve Morgan Williams</dc:title>
<dc:date>1861</dc:date>
<dc:description>Small child in a blue dress, seated on what appears to be a marble step, with a variety of cut flowers in her lap, holding up a sprig containing three red blossoms. A landscape with city is visible in the distance at far right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This portrait depicts the granddaughter of Samuel Dold Morgan (1798-1880) a powerful Nashville industrialist who supplied percussion caps for the war effort and whose sons served in the Confederacy. Genevieve (1859-1915), who appears to be about two or three years of age, holds what appear to be Bleeding Heart blossoms in her left hand. At far right is a  distant view of the newly-completed Tennessee State Capitol, for which her grandfather served on the Building Commission. Genevieve's father, Robert N. Williams, was a physician who owned plantation lands in Arkansas. Like two of his wife's brothers, he served in the Confederate army. Unlike his Morgan brothers-in-law, Williams survived the war. Genevieve later married a Kentuckian and lived in Lexington, KY. This painting stayed in the family until 1985 when it was sold at auction;  soon afterwards it was purchased by the Tennessee State Museum. From 1859 until 1862, when he left the city for neutral Kentucky, artist Thomas Waterman Wood, a New Englander who had moved to the growing cosmopolitan city of Nashville to make a living as a portrait artist and genre painter, enjoyed the patronage of wealthy Nashvillians.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This image shows the left side of a long drawing, which has been scanned in two sections.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Ink drawing of the sweep of Tennessee River including Moccasin Bend. Some locations are labeled across the top of the sheet. The labels, left to right, read: Hookers Camps, Raccoon Range, Waldens Ridge, Williams I., Brown's Ferry, Moccasin Point, Chattanooga, Sherman's C (cut off). Barely legible at lower left edge, which is torn, are these words:  &quot;Looki(ng) (Sout)hward Over Lookout Va(lley).&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>Although both Theodore Davis and James Walker worked in the Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain area as &quot;Special Artists&quot; for Harpers Weekly and other publications during the war, they also created and published images in the years following. The Point Hotel, for example, which is featured at the far right of the pair to this two-part drawing, was built in May 1888 as the city's incline station.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Home of Major John H. Bills, Bolivar</dc:title>
<dc:publisher>Garden Study Club of Nashville, Parthenon Press</dc:publisher>
<dc:date>1936</dc:date>
<dc:description>This black and white photograph shows the front porch of a house screened by trees and bushes.  The porch has four white one-story white columns above the front steps and two more widely spaced columns on either side that hold a porch roof that stretches across the whole front of the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Houston Bills, a close friend and contemporary of President James K. Polk, added a wing and a second story to this house in the small town of Bolivar, Tennessee, which is located in lower West Tennessee, surrounded by plantation lands. He also designed the home's formal garden, remnants of which are visible today. During the Civil War, to which he was heartily opposed, he had cordial relations with Union officers passing through and occupying the town, even as his son-in-law, Marshall Polk, a nephew of James K. and Sarah Childress Polk, served with Confederate forces. He built a small cottage behind The Pillars, for his daughter Evalina Bills Polk, so that she could stay close to her family while her husband was away at war.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of General Samuel P. Carter (Union)</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1861</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait of a dark-haired, bearded man in young middle age, wearing the uniform of a United States Brigadier General. He is shown in half-figure, seated next to a marble-topped table, holding a sword across his lap with his left hand and a cap in his right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This portrait of Samuel P. Carter (1818-1891), who was born in Elizabethon, in upper East Tennessee, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy, shows him as a Union general at the beginning of the Civil War. Carter, who had taught mathematics at the Naval Academy, was a natural leader. He  was granted a special appointment by the U.S. Army to organize a regiment of loyalists in East Tennessee. His brother, William B. Carter, helped to organize the November 1861 bridge burning campaign in East Tennessee in order to stymie Confederate forces moving through the state during the first year of the war. Artist Samuel Shaver (1816-1878) was one of East Tennessee's best-known portrait painters.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Photograph of Andrew Johnson in Masonic Regalia, 1869</dc:title>
<dc:date>1869</dc:date>
<dc:description>Formal portrait photograph with some hand-coloring showing Andrew Johnson dressed in a dark frock coat, with white sash across his chest from right shoulder to left hip, his left hand behind his back at waist, and his right hand on an ornate ceremonial dagger. A cap with ornamental braid sits on a stand at his right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Taken in Nashville, in the final year of Johnson's term of office, this portrait of Andrew Johnson by photographer Carl C. Giers (1828-1877) may have been intended to bolster the President's stature after he survived impeachment by just one vote. Vice-President Johnson, who had assumed office after Lincoln's assassination in 1865, was resented by too quickly &quot;reconstructing&quot; the South--allowing former Confederates who took an oath of allegiance to the United States to regain property and position. And he seemed to look the other way as &quot;black codes&quot; that greatly restricted the activities of those who had been granted full citizenship by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 were put in place in many southern states.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Lloyd Branson, carte-de-visite</dc:title>
<dc:date>1873</dc:date>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a young man wearing a frock coat, white shirt, and bow tie, seated on a low, fringed chair, with legs crossed and holding a paintbrush and palette,  before an easel holding  a portait of another young man.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This carte-de-visite, created for painter Lloyd Branson (1854-1925) by Knoxville photographer Theodore M. Schleier (1832-1908), may have been the younger artist's first professional calling card. Schleier, who was  born in Prussia, is known to have worked in Nashville during the period from 1859-1869 and in Knoxville during the 1870s and 1880s. Branson, born in Knoxville to English parents, studied at the National Academy of Design in New York from 1873-1875,when he won a prize that facilitated  travel to Europe to continue his studies. He returned to Knoxville in 1878 to become one of the area's preeminent artists. In the early 1890s. Branson was commissioned to design a soldier for the top of the Confederate monument at Bethel Cemetery. Bethel, a burial ground initially owned by Knox County, was enlarged during the Confederate occupation of Knoxville by two acres from Joseph Mabry who lived nearby. Branson's design for the monument was executed in Tennessee gray marble by Union veteran George Hoyle Whitaker, who had served in the 143rd New York Infantry.</dc:description>

<dc:date>circa 1890</dc:date>
<dc:description>Men in suits and women in white dresses visiting a monument surrounded by a stone wall.  A child on horseback stands behind the procession of visitors at right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Hazen monument, built of local limestone, was constructed by soldiers soon after the Battle of Stones River, in order to honor fallen comrades in Hazen's Brigade, which had also lost men at the Battle of Shiloh in preceding months. The monument is flanked by tombstones and surrounded by a low limestone wall. These formally dressed visitors are likely making a commemorative pilgrimage to the monument and graveyard.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Designs for Gate and Stone Fence</dc:title>
<dc:title>Chattanooga National Cemetery, Design for Gates and Stone Fence</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1863</dc:date>
<dc:description>Three separate drawings on one sheet done in a scale of 1/2 inch to 1 foot. The drawings show a stone wall, with a wooden gate, and stone or concrete gate posts mounted into a wood and rubble below-ground structure, which is shown in a detail.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This engineering drawing, which was found in the papers of William Alonzo Wainright, United States Assistant Quartermaster, 1861-1870, shows a design apparently intended for the Chattanooga National Cemetery, where re-burial of Union casualties began, under the command of General George H. Thomas, on 25 November 1863.  Drawn in ink on paper with fancy block lettering, three separate views  illustrate  a stone wall supported by an embankment, a wide wooden gate with a smaller gate door, and either stone or concrete gateposts to be buried below grade in a wooden structure made from timbers arranged as crossed rectangles. During Wainright's tenure, the Quartermaster Department of the U.S. Army oversaw the creation of national cemeteries, which entailed retrieving and identifying bodies and reinterring them on newly landscaped burial grounds  at Knoxville, Murfreesboro, Atlanta, and Chattanooga.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Flight of the Warrior's Soul</dc:title>
<dc:date>1865</dc:date>
<dc:description>Oval image depicting a banner held by three flying figures against a light sky above a clouded dark landscape in which a uniformed man stands next to a broken wagon wheel and another figure is seated on the ground next to him.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This is the earliest known Civil War-themed work by artist Carl Gutherz whose family moved from Switzerland to Memphis in 1860, when he was 16. It is a mourning picture intended to honor death by showing its memory lifted into heaven. Although Gutherz's brother Fred served in the 154th Senior Volunteer Regiment depicted in the banner, he survived the war. Fred spent time in the Confederate army as an engineer and produced several sketches from his observations. The younger Carl returned to Europe to study in France in the 1870s and 1880s, and made his fame painting large &quot;salon&quot; paintings intended for public viewing. Rather than showing heroic battlefield scenes, these paintings, like this symbolic mourning picture, portray a sense of loss.</dc:description>

<dc:description>James Hervey Otey was the first Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee. While living in Columbia, Tennessee, he helped organize  the Ashwood Episcopal Church and the Columbia Female Institute with his close friend Leonidas Polk. Polk and his several brothers,  cousins of President James K. Polk, were prominent and wealthy plantation owners in the Ashwood district outside of Columbia.  Leonidas Polk enlisted Otey in founding the University of the South in 1857. Polk, who was serving as Bishop of the Southwest Territory and living in Louisiana when the Civil War broke out, joined the Confederate Army. Neither he nor Otey lived to see the opening of the University where they had hoped to provide a classical education for young southern gentlemen.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This fashionable house, designed by an unknown architect, was commissioned by John J. Craig, a prominent  businessman originally from Alabama, who was engaged in mercantile and banking activities just  prior to the Civil War. Like several of his Unionist peers, Craig moved away from the city in the early years of the war. With his wife, Knoxvillian Mary Lyon, and their infant son, he relocated to Cincinnati and  later to New York while conflict raged in Tennessee. Another well-known Knoxville Unionist, Oliver P. Temple, purchased the house in 1865 and renamed it Melrose.  After the war, Craig returned to Knoxville and founded one of Tennessee's largest marble companies.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Poynor Armless Sewing Rocker</dc:title>
<dc:title>Rocking Chair</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1855</dc:date>
<dc:description>Armless rocking chair with split-bottom seat and missing wood in top slat.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This chair was made by Richard Poynor (1802-1882) an African American furniture artisan in Williamson County, Tennessee.  Poynor,  born into slavery, purchased his freedom in the 1850s. A prolific and popular chairmaker, Poynor is best-known for this type of ladderback chair, with its distinctive arched slats.  Seats were usually fashioned from oak splits, rockers from walnut, and chair frames from hickory and maple. This chair, reputed to have been inside the Carter House, in Franklin, Tennessee, during the Battle of Franklin in November 1864,  was apparently damaged by a bullet. The Carter family's son Todd, a Confederate soldier, died in the house from wounds suffered during the same battle.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Barnard, George N.</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>This formal studio portrait photograph shows a bearded man of young middle-age, well-dressed, standing with his left elbow resting on a half-curtained pedestal and right hand on the back of a small armless chair.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Photographer George N. Barnard (1819-1902) worked in Matthew Brady's photography studio in New York City and Washington, D.C.  in the early 1860s, which is probably when this  portrait photograph was made. After the outbreak of the Civil War, still under Brady's auspices, Barnard made photographs of battlefields in Virginia and the vicinity of Washington, D.C. He was appointed in late 1863 to oversee photographic operations for the United States Army Topographical Engineers in the Army of the Cumberland, which was headquartered in Nashville. Barnard's photographs of Knoxville and Chattanooga attest to his presence there in 1864.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Factories and Platforms of Knoxville</dc:title>
<dc:date>1856</dc:date>
<dc:description>This drawing comes from the &quot;Swiss-American Sketchbook&quot; in the McClung Historical Collection.</dc:description>
<dc:description>A pencil drawing of a train underway with smoke belching from its locomotive, pulling by a covered platform. There are  three large buildings with smokestacks in the distance, and at right a building with a series of arches and railroad tracks leading inside.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This drawing, by Swiss artist Auguste Burnand, depicts factories and railroad tracks located in the northern section of the City of Knoxville, where the newly-completed East Tennessee &amp; Georgia Railroad into Knoxville and the under-construction East Tennessee &amp; Virginia Railroad had shared depots and connecting tracks. Once the East Tennessee &amp; Georgia Railroad was completed to Knoxville, goods formerly carried downstream by river could move quickly south to the ports of Georgia and South Carolina. After the East Tennessee &amp; Virginia Railroad opened in 1858,  passengers and luxury goods could travel easily to and from cities of the mid-Atlantic by the most direct route north through the Valley of Virginia.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Tombstones of Julius and Bertha Levy Ochs</dc:title>
<dc:description>This detail shows base of a granite obelisk with two granite frames laid out in front of it marking the resting places of those buried in the graves below the marker: Julius Ochs (1826-1888) and  Bertha Levy Ochs (1833-1908).</dc:description>
<dc:description>This is the tombstone of the parents of Adolph Ochs, Julius and Bertha Ochs. Julius died in Chattanooga in 1888.  Adolph, who was raised in Knoxville, had experienced life in that divided city during the war. His father Julius served in the Union army,while his mother, Bertha Levy, who had grown up on a plantation in the Deep South, remained loyal to the Confederacy. Their tombstones reveal their conflicting sympathies. His reads: &quot;He loved and bravely served the country of his adoption. He was gifted, cultured, noble and pure. An indulgent father, a model husband, a true philanthropist and a God-fearing man.&quot; Hers reads: &quot;A brilliant mind, a pure soul overflowing with love for God, her family, and the South.&quot;  While in Chattanooga, Adolph Ochs, a successful newspaper publisher who revived Chattanooga's daily and acquired the New York Times in 1896, was a prominent member of Chattanooga society, participating in some of the South's earliest Blue-Gray reunions and supporting the formation of the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Battlefied as well as helping to preserve portions of Lookout Mountain.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This drawing, whose title mis-spells Dickinson's name, is part of the &quot;Swiss American Sketchbook&quot; of Auguste Burnand. Burnand lived in the Swiss American community near Knoxville, Tennessee, from 1853-1860. The house depicted in the drawing once  belonged to Perez Dickinson. Dickinson, who grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, followed his brother-in-law, Joseph Estabrook, principal of the Knoxville Female Academy, to Knoxville around 1830.  Dickinson lived in this Knoxville residence with Estabrook and his wife Nancy Dickinson, along with his sister and his mother, apparently purchasing it in 1851. Dickinson left Knoxville during the Civil War, but returned afterwards to resume his interest in the mercantile partnership of Cowan McClung, which included his brother-in-law, James H. Cowan,  and former confederates Frank H. and Charles J. McClung.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Isham Green Harris, from Paris, Tennessee, was Governor of Tennessee at the outbreak of the Civil War. In many respects, he was responsible for constructing a legislative process by which the state government moved to secede from the Union, even though citizens of the state were almost evenly divided on the issue. Harris organized a state militia that he turned over to the Confederate Army and served as an advisor to the Army, seeing action at Shiloh and other conflicts. He returned to Tennessee politics in 1877 and was elected to the United States Senate, in which he served until 1895.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Centennial Exposition was a celebration of the state's centennial but it was also an opportunity to honor Civil War veterans in events and displays.  Music was an important part of the celebration. “United Confederate Veterans Days” at the Exposition were June 22-24, 1897, coinciding with the 7th Annual Reunion of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV). This sheet music is hand dated on the following day.The march was composed by Maurice Bernhardt, a Memphis resident who submitted his entry as part of a competition organized by The O.K. Houck Company of Memphis. The march was first played in public by Sousa's Peerless Band at the Grand Opera House in Memphis on January 20, 1897.</dc:description>

<dc:date>circa 1882</dc:date>
<dc:description>Two carte-de-visite photographs showing (on left): the head and shoulders of a young man with wispy beard  and (on right): the head and shoulders of an older gentleman with mustache and beard. At the bottom of card on right: &quot;McCrary &amp; Branson, Knoxville, Tenn.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>These two men, father and son, died in a shootout on Knoxville's Gay Street on 19 October 1882. Prior to the Civil War, the elder Mabry was a wealthy landowner and founder of the Knoxville &amp; Kentucky Railroad. Even though he paid to outfit a Confederate regiment, once Union troops arrived in Knoxville he moved quickly to guard his business interests and took the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. His 1858 house on a high hill northeast of the city was used by both Confederate and Union soldiers because it commanded good views of the surrounding terrain. The photograph of the senior Mabry bears the name of the Knoxville photography studio McCrary &amp; Branson. Artist Lloyd Branson and partner Frank McCrary operated a studio in Knoxville from the early 1880s to 1903.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Boots belonging to Colonel John T. Wilder</dc:title>
<dc:date>cia. 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a pair of well-worn brown leather riding boots of medium height, one boot shown on its side with sole visible, the other standing as seen from the rear.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Union officer Colonel John T. Wilder of Indiana was the commander of the &quot;lightning&quot; brigade, whose presence critical to the success of actions around Tullahoma, Chattanooga, and Chickamauga in the summer and fall of 1863. At the conclusion of the war, Wilder was promoted to Brigadier General as a tribute. He parlayed a successful iron business in Chattanooga into a political career and was elected Mayor of Chattanooga in 1871. This pair of boots might well have been ordered by Wilder from a local shoemaker during the course of the war. A post-war claim filed in Hawkins County, Tennessee, by an African American saddler and harness maker listed custom-made boots for Union soldiers as one of the items for which he had been promised payment.</dc:description>

<dc:date>ca. 1870</dc:date>
<dc:description>Park-like setting in which a stone obelisk topped with a  uniformed soldier stands surrounded by a paved circular walkway, with two flags bearing the Confederate &quot;stars and bars&quot; planted on the lawn on either side of the walkway entrance. Various tombstones and a small mausoleum are also visible in the vicinity.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Confederate Circle at Mt. Olivet Cemetery was created in 1869 as part of a reinterment project designed to honor approximately 1500 Confederate soldiers who died in and around Nashville during the Civil War.  Members of the Ladies Memorial Society purchased a prominent location on a hill within the existing 1855 cemetery. Officials and dignitaries attended the dedication of the new burial ground on 9 May 1869, which was declared the  local &quot;Decoration Day&quot;  in Nashville. The program also encompassed a visit to decorate graves at the old City Cemetery, from which some of the dead were  being transferred.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Coverlet</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1840s</dc:date>
<dc:description>White on white square cotton coverlet with tufted designs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This carefully stitched coverlet was made from unbleached cotton. The pattern alternates star and floral shapes with leaves, set into a grid, with geometric cone and curved shapes forming a surrounding motif. It is said to have been crafted by one or more slaves of Mrs. William Winfree, the great great grandmother of William Williams Dupree. In some plantation households, weavers and seamstresses worked alongside their mistresses.  Often they were loaned or &quot;jobbed out&quot; to neighboring plantations, as were shoemakers, saddlers, blacksmiths, horse trainers, cart drivers and furniture makers. Some of these men and women were able to make the transition from slavery to self-supporting artisans after emancipation.</dc:description>

<dc:date>circa 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portable cylindrical drum, covered in brown leather, with tightly stretched leather binding holding the face to the drum body.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This drum was found in a Confederate camp north of Knoxville on the Rutledge Pike. General James Longstreet (1821-1904), a West Point graduate, resigned the United States Army to join the Confederacy under fellow West Point man Robert E. Lee in 1861. After many campaigns east and south, Longstreet contested the Union Army at Knoxville in November 1863. After suffering defeat at the Battle of Fort Sanders, he marched his men north into East Tennessee, where he spent the winter encamped in the vicinity of Russellville.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Newton Cannon Maney in Military School Uniform</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>Formal studio portrait, in color, of a young man standing with his right hand resting on two books stacked on top of a ornately carved table in front of a  painted backdrop of an arched window looking out to a landscape. The beardless young man wears his cap cocked slightly to his right, and his coat is open to reveal a watch chain and wrinkled white shirt. This carte de visite has the name &quot;C Giers&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot; printed on the lower margin.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This portrait of Newton Cannon Maney  [1849-1934] was taken in the Nashville studio of photographer Carl Giers. Maney grew up at Oaklands Plantation in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The son of one of the prominent families in Middle Tennessee, he was named after his grandfather, Newton Cannon, who had been governor of Tennessee from 1835-1839. Probably too young to have enlisted in the Confederate army, young Maney, who was one of eight children, wears a Confederate-style cap. The short, double breasted jacket has an elaborate insignia on the sleeves that might be useful in identifying the military school he attended. The Maney children saw Murfreesboro change hands several times during the war. In July 1862, the grounds of  Oaklands were serving as a Union encampment when soldiers under the command of Nathan Bedford Forrest arrived to capture the town for the Confederacy. A Union officer wounded in the battle was brought into the house for medical treatment. After the Battle of Stones River in late December, early January 1863, Murfreesboro was returned to Union control.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Shell ornament, incised designs of woodpeckers</dc:title>
<dc:description>Incised circular gorget cut from conch shell.  Has two drilled holes along edge through which the hanging cord was strung.  Also has four smaller drilled holes in the center encircled by three concentric circles and sun rays. The center sun emblem is then bordered by a square made up of 3 incised lines on each side.  At the corners, the lines curl around and under.  To the outside of the square are four woodpecker heads, one to each side of the square.  
 
Woodpecker gorget found by D. G. Charles in a stone box burial on the Buffalo River, near Ashland, Wayne County, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The pileated woodpecker symbolized war, while the looped-corner square represented the four cardinal directions and the rayed sun was associated with one of the principal deities of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. This gorget, which was published by General Gates P. Thruston on page 327 of his ANTIQUITIES OF TENNESSEE (1890), was included in the extensive collection of artifacts that he donated to Vanderbilt University.</dc:description>

<dc:title>John Watkins' Telescope</dc:title>
<dc:title>Telescope Used by Corporal John Watkins at the Battle of Fort Sanders</dc:title>
<dc:description>Hand-held, extending telescope, with brass finish.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Watkins, a corporal with the 19th Ohio Battery, was present at the Battle of Fort Sanders in November 1863. His eyewitness description concludes, &quot;As soon as the firing stopped I went up and got on the parapet to look at them. And such a sight I never saw before nor do I care about seeing again. The ditch in places was almost full of them piled one on top of the other.... They were brave men. Most of them Georgians.&quot;  Watkins returned to Knoxville for a reunion in 1895 and recounted the visit as follows: &quot;Went to Fort Sanders, looked the place over and talked with old soldiers and some other people about it, but it will soon be of the past -- boys are helping to tear down the parapets to find bullets and they get lots of them.... We can locate the place where our gun stood all right, now there is a big house built within 100 feet of it and a road is graded right through the works between where we were.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>This cover image for Harper's Weekly issue dated November 16, 1867, drawn by Alfred R. Waud, depicts a line of African American men in the process of voting for the first time in their lives. Even though the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution had abolished slavery in 1865, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted many rights to the freed slaves, questions and controversies surrounded the act of voting and many African Americans were denied their opportunity until the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment specifically granted them that specific right  in 1868. Artist Thomas Waterman Wood painted many versions of a similar scene beginning in 1868.</dc:description>

The three-story building with open porches at right has the appearance of a rustic hotel. A locomotive heading down the track passes directly by the hotel.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Although both Theodore Davis and James Walker worked in the Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain area as &quot;Special Artists&quot; for Harpers Weekly and other publications during the war, they also created and published images in the years following. The Point Hotel, for example, which is featured at the far right of this image, was built in May 1888 as the city's incline station.</dc:description>

<dc:date>ca. 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>This map, drawn in black ink, with the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers in blue, shows telegraph lines between Forts Henry and Donelson in red, the names of some landowners, directions toward cities. It also indicates the  topography using cross-hatched lines,  trees with small shaded circles, and  the town of Dover as a shaded grid of town blocks. Inscribed at lower right &quot;Engrs Dept. July 1861 (4?) rec'd with Gen. Callum's letter of 16th inst (C 5021),&quot; and titled &quot; Sketch Showing Positions of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, with the roads connecting the two places, drawn under direction of Lt Col J.B. McPherson, Chief Engineer&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>This map was created by federal engineers to illustrate the movement of troops and terrain in the vicinity of Confederate Forts Henry and Donelson. Although these forts were planned to control access to the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, federal gunboats and soldiers on the ground managed to take both within a period of a few days in February 1862, which gave them easy access into the heart of Middle Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page from a newspaper features seven vignettes showing exterior and interior scenes of Polk Place and The Hermitage, including Polk's and Jackson's tombs,  and one vignette with the head and shoulders of a elderly woman (Sarah Polk) wearing a veil.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Polk Place, the Nashville retirement home of President and Mrs. James K. Polk, and The Hermitage, President Andrew Jackson's plantation home outside of Nashville, were places of pilgrimage where patriotic citizens, particularly southerners, could reflect on the decades of American unity and prosperity prior to the Civil War. Former first lady Sarah Childress Polk, shown in this illustration in mourning garb, remained at Polk Place throughout the war, keeping the house much as her husband had left it. She entertained officers and prominent citizens from both sides, maintaining public neutrality even though some relatives fought for the Confederacy.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Watkins, John, carte-de-visite</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>Formal studio half-length portrait of a seated young man wearing a federal uniform jacket with a two stripe chevron on the left sleeve. At the bottom left of this carte-de-visite is in the inscription &quot;A.C. Platt, Oberlin, O.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Watkins, a corporal with the 19th Ohio Battery, was present at the Battle of Fort Sanders in November 1863. His eyewitness description concludes, &quot;As soon as the firing stopped I went up and got on the parapet to look at them. And such a sight I never saw before nor do I care about seeing again. The ditch in places was almost full of them piled one on top of the other.... They were brave men. Most of them Georgians.&quot;  Watkins returned to Knoxville for a reunion in 1895 and recounted the visit as follows: &quot;Went to Fort Sanders, looked the place over and talked with old soldiers and some other people about it, but it will soon be of the past -- boys are helping to tear down the parapets to find bullets and they get lots of them.... We can locate the place where our gun stood all right, now there is a big house built within 100 feet of it and a road is graded right through the works between where we were.&quot;  He also mentioned having been well received at the Armstrong House (Bleak House): &quot;We were a little doubtful about our receipt... [but we were] escorted into the parlor to sit and rest awhile...showed us every room in the house. Showed us all the bullet-holes and shell marks...showed us where his guns were placed on either side of the house, also where some men were killed on both sides, rebel and Federal and where buried in her yard. We were also on the spot where General Sanders was shot about 80 rods from her house.&quot; Their hostess that day would have been Louisa Armstrong, formerly a staunch supporter of the Confederacy. The University of Tennessee owns papers and artifacts related to John Watkins and they can be seen at the Frank H. McClung Museum and the University of Tennessee Library Special Collections. Alfred Platt was listed as an ambrotypist living in Oberlin, Ohio in the 1860 census.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Slave Charm</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1850</dc:date>
<dc:description>This tiny metal hand and wrist holds a flat ribbon-like loop.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tiny metal charms such as this have begun to be discovered during archaeological explorations of areas where slaves once lived. This one was unearthed in the slave quarter of The Hermitage, a plantation on the outskirts of Nashville that once belonged to President Andrew Jackson. Another tiny charm, stamped out of alloyed copper and meant to be held in the hand,has been found in Memphis, on the site of the Hilderbrand House, where the grounds housed at least five families of slaves in the 1850s. This artistically-forged image of a human fist appears to hold a lash, however, interpretations based on early twentieth century oral history suggest that the clenched fist was commonly used as a symbolic defense against bad things.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Black and white map of Tennessee, with red shading for counties in a wide swath north to south encompassing the Cumberland Plateau and various red dots in three distinct portions of the state.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This map was created by Tennessee's first Commissioner of Agriculture, Joseph Bucker Killebrew (1831-1906) in order to highlight the locations of  iron ore, coal, zinc, and copper deposits in Tennessee. The shaded red area represents potential coal fields, while red dots show iron ore in the western highland rim area of Middle Tennessee, in areas within and on the eastern edge of the Cumberland Plateau, and in upper East Tennessee. Killebrew was appointed to the post in 1871 and served until 1880.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Athenaeum Rectory, Columbia, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>Picturesque scene with well-dressed young women in hats and light-colored dresses in seated and standing poses outdoors in front of a vine covered two-story building with a three-arched portico and a fountain in the front yard.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Originally commissioned by a cousin of James K. Polk, the Rectory (completed 1837) became the residence of the Reverend and Mrs. Franklin Gillette Smith after they moved from  Virginia to Columbia, Tennessee so that he could  become headmaster of the Columbia Female Institute. Even though Smith left the Institute in 1851, he and his wife continued to live at the Rectory, which became an essential part of the campus of the his Columbia Athenaeum, founded in 1852. The Athenaeum, which was primarily a boarding school for young women, remained open throughout the Civil War. It continued in operation after Smith's death under the auspices of one of his sons until 1904. This unusual building, with its Venetian Gothic Revival design, has been attributed to Nashville architect/engineer Adolphus Heiman.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Wood, The Veteran</dc:title>
<dc:date>1866</dc:date>
<dc:format>28 1/4 x 20 1/4 in.</dc:format>
<dc:description>This is the right hand portion of a triptych showing an African American man in the same location at three stages of his military career. Here, now on crutches, with his left leg amputated at the knee and wearing rumpled Union blue, he salutes outside of the Provost Marshall's Office. Inside the office is a large U.S. flag, on the wall outside hangs a rifle, ammunition belt, and mess kit. A ragged knapsack lies at his feet.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This series of three paintings by Thomas Waterman Wood (1823-1903), created in 1866, shows the progression of an ex-slave from his enlistment in the Union army to his return as a wounded veteran. Wood, who was living in Nashville in 1862, moved to Louisville in neutral Kentucky for the remainder of the war.  His dignified and sympathetic portrayals of African Americans working in the fields or accepting new responsibilities prior to and immediately after the war are so unusual as to become political statements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Columbia Athenaeum, a school for young women in Columbia, Tennessee, was founded in 1852 by Reverend Franklin Gillette Smith (1797-1866) after he left the Columbia Female Institute, where he had been headmaster since 1837. The former school had been founded by locally prominent citizens, including Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee James Hervey Otey and Reverend Leonidas Polk (1806-1864), Bishop of the Southwest Territory. Otey, Polk, and other Episcopal leaders were also instrumental in founding the University of the South at Sewanee, although neither lived to see it open after the Civil War. While the Columbia Female Institute closed during the war, Smith and his wife worked tirelessly to keep the Athenaeum boarding school open for any young ladies who cared to stay, fearful that the buildings might be destroyed in their absence. Columbia, the county seat of Maury County, which encompasses some of the richest farmland in the state, became a stronghold of Confederate sympathies during the war.  Among the owners of many of the large plantations in the surrounding area can be found several Confederate generals, including Gideon Pillow and Leonidas Polk. Polk, who was a graduate of West Point, resigned from his post as Bishop of Louisiana to fight in the army.</dc:description>

Haun was  hanged by Confederate officials in  Knoxville on 10 December 1861.  He was one of five men executed for their actions disrupting the movement of Confederate troops and supplies into upper East Tennessee.  This image appeared on page 312 of William G. Brownlow's Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession; with a Narrative of Personal Adventures Among the Rebels (Philadelphia: George W.

<dc:description>Landscape view of river valley with prominent rock formation at right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Created more than a decade after the Civil War, this close-up view of a rock formation on Lookout Mountain would have instantly evoked memories of the dramatic Civil War battle in which Union soldiers advanced up from the Tennessee River valley below to defeat Confederate forces holding the high ground on 24 November 1863. The artist, James Hope, served in the Union army as a topographical engineer.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Belmont</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1859</dc:date>
<dc:format>39-1/2 in. x 53-1/2 in.</dc:format>
<dc:description>Landscape showing lush greenery in foreground, with a brick house on a hill in background, and a tall brick tower on left. Three figures, two men on horseback, and a large African American man emerging to meet them, dominate the composition at lower center. A diminutive figure is visible outside the green house and a horse and carriage travels down the path from the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This painting, by an unknown artist, depicts a distant view of Belmont Mansion, which is featured prominently at top center. The scene in the foreground includes what looks like a vineyard, while greenhouses and a water tower can be seen at left and center, and the curving paths of formal gardens with gazebos and statuary leads up to the house itself. Engineer/Architect Adolphus Heiman remodeled the house for Adelicia and Joseph Acklen just before the Civil War to give the impression of an Italian villa. The oversized figures in the foreground allude to the wealth of the gardens at Belmont as the African American worker extending an out-of-scale bunch of grapes to two men on horseback might be seen as a symbol of hospitality. Produce was an important part of the hostess' reputation but vegetable and fruit gardens tended to be placed on the perimeter of the grounds, so as to not distract from the formal beauty as one approached the home.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Portrait of a dark-haired young woman in elaborate riding dress, standing with a large horse against a treed landscape.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Adelicia Hayes Franklin Acklen was a widow and the mistress of Belmont Mansion at the time of the Battle of Nashville. At the time this portrait was painted, she was married to her first husband, Isaac Franklin. Upon his death, she became one of the wealthiest women in Tennessee and inherited plantation holdings in Louisiana as well as in and around Nashville. She married Joseph Acklen, a lawyer from Huntsville, in 1849, but was again widowed in 1863. During the Civil War, she remained in Nashville but also managed to successfully oversee valuable cotton interests in Louisiana. The night before the Battle of Nashville, as many as 3000 Union troops were encamped upon the grounds of Belmont Mansion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fortification with two cannon ports and wide trench littered with rocks and debris below. There are tree stumps in right foreground. A uniformed soldier stands on top of fort next to bare flagpole.</dc:description>
<dc:description>According to the fort's designer, Orlando M. Poe, Captain of Engineers, photographer George Barnard took these photographs at Fort Sanders. Barnard, who had worked in the studio of Matthew Brady during the early years of the Civil War, was appointed as official photographer for the United States Army's Military Division of the Mississippi, headquartered in Nashville, in late 1863. Working with the Topographic Branch of the Department of Engineers, he photographed the forts, bridges, and landscapes of East Tennessee during the early months of 1864. Based on drawings of the fort, the solider stands on the western face and the ditch which Orlando Poe had constructed is seen at right. Confederate troops,advancing in the pre-dawn hours, underestimated the depth of the ditch and were not aware that the Union soldiers had poured water over the wall to make it icy. The battle lasted only 20 minutes and resulted in heavy casualties for the Confederacy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>William Wallace Warfield was a prominent resident of Clarksville, Tennessee, when artist Robert Loftin Newman opened a studio there in 1858. Newman's large portrait of Warfield and his young son, William Laban, is one of a pair painted for wealthy patrons just prior to the Civil War. Newman was one of the few professional artists in Tennessee to join the Confederate forces. Aside from a post-war pair of portrait drawings of generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, Newman is not known to have created any war-themed works.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This drawing, done by the wife of Joseph A. Mabry during the final months of the Civil War, is inscribed &quot;Home after war, showing fort and ditches&quot;  and bears the date 8 Feb 1865. Mabry, a prominent railroad man, paid to outfit a Confederate regiment at the beginning of the war. However, after Knoxville was returned to Union control, he signed an oath of allegiance to the United States and cooperated with Union officials for the duration of the war.  This drawing depicts the Mabrys' stately country home on a hill in northeast Knoxville, a location that seems to have served as a vantage point for troops on both sides.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Theodore Davis and James Walker were two of the most prolific &quot;Special Artists&quot; working in the Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain area for Harpers Weekly and other publications during the Civil War. Here, Davis depicts a fellow artist, possibly Walker, painting a bend in the Tennessee River with the city of Chattanooga featured behind a low hill. After the Confederate defeats of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge in November 1863, the path to Atlanta was opened for Union forces, who would have been on the move in 1864. Wagons move across a pontoon bridge toward Chattanooga. </dc:description>

Some months after the December 1863 Battle of Stones River, a monument and a small cemetery were created to honor those men in Colonel William B. Hazen's brigade who had died at Shiloh the previous April as well as those who fell at Stones River. The creation of a national cemetery at Stones River was overseen by Chaplain William Earnshaw and members of the 111th United States Colored Troops who began the work of re-interring Union soldiers in October 1865. </dc:description>

<dc:description>After the death of Bishop James H. Otey in 1863, Doctor C.T. Quintard became the second Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee. During the Civil War, he served as a chaplain with an elite group of Confederate soldiers, the Rock City Guards, which was organized from Nashville and the surrounding area. This book was printed in Columbia, South Carolina, apparently to be issued to Confederate soldiers. According to tradition, a copy was found in the jacket of Leonidas Polk after his death at Pine Mountain, Georgia, on June 4, 1864.

<dc:title>Sewanee Cornerstone Receipt</dc:title>
<dc:title>Receipt for Tennessee Marble Cornerstone</dc:title>
<dc:date>1860</dc:date>
<dc:description>This small rectangular receipt, printed in blue ink on white paper bears the trademark logo of Nashville Marble Dealer J. Sloan. It is written to University of the South. Figures for labor and delivery add up to a total of $87.25.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This receipt, made out to the University of the South, reflects the purchase of a hand-wrought marble cornerstone from &quot;J. Sloan Steam Marble Works Market Street Nashville Tennessee&quot; on October 15, 1860. Marble dealer James Sloan of Nashville also supplied the East Tennessee marble for the interior of the Tennessee State Capitol.  Two small books carved from the brown variegated marble of the cornerstone, which was destroyed by Union soldiers on July 13, 1863, can also be found in the museum collection of the University of the South.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Sewanee Flag</dc:title>
<dc:title>Flag Used during Founding and Dedication of the University of the South</dc:title>
<dc:date>1851</dc:date>
<dc:description>United States flag with thirteen red and white alternating bars, blue field with 13 stars surrounded by a circle of 18, and a gold fringe border. The flag is faded and several sections of fringe are missing.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This presentation flag, which bears the 31 stars of the United States after admission of California in 1851, was carried in the University of the South's initial founding ceremony, which included a patriotic procession on Lookout Mountain on July 4, 1857. It was also used at the dedication marking the University's permanent location on October 10, 1860. Although founded three years earlier by Bishops Leonidas Polk and James Hervey Otey, a permanent location was not obtained until just before the Civil War. The war and its aftermath delayed the start of classes at the University until 1867.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A young woman dressed in an off the shoulder gown of shiny fabric, with a light shawl around her upper arms, rests her right hand on the shoulder of a young girl in a fancy dress with white bloomers. The two are standing on a balcony-like terrace overlooking a landscape with river below.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Adelia Boisseau Warfield and her husband William Wallace Warfield were prominent residents of Clarksville, Tennessee, when artist Robert Loftin Newman opened a studio there in 1858. Newman's large portrait of Adelia and her young daughter, Huldah Belle, is one of a pair painted for these wealthy patrons just prior to the Civil War. Newman was one of the few professional artists in Tennessee to join the Confederate forces. Aside from a post-war pair of portrait drawings of generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson and a flag design for the Confederacy, Newman is not known to have created any war-themed works.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The home of William Hunt, just outside of downtown Memphis, was occupied by both Confederate and Federal officers during the war. The inscription on this photograph indicates that it was taken over by the Western Sanitary Commission on 8 February 1863 for use as a &quot;soldier's home,&quot; under the jurisdiction of the matron and superintendent pictured here. The imposing brick mansion is also thought to have been a Freedmen's School for several years before it was returned to the Hunt family.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of John McGavock</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1848</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait of a young, dark-haired man facing forward with his right hand holding the fold of his jacket at chest height. He is wearing a formal white shirt and vest, with dark tie and  coat. The canvas appears to have been cut down at the sides, perhaps to fit a frame other than the original.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John McGavock (1815-1893) was the owner of Carnton Plantation, just outside of Franklin, Tennessee, during the Civil War. His wife, Carrie Winder McGavock (1829-1905), who was present when the house and yard were used as a makeshift hospital after the Battle of Franklin on 30 November 1864, oversaw the burial of as many as 1500 Confederate soldiers in a cemetery on the grounds. </dc:description>

<dc:title>79th Scottish Highlander Reunion at Bleak House</dc:title>
<dc:title>Reunion of Veterans of the 79th New York Highlanders, Knoxville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1890-1895</dc:date>
<dc:description>Photograph in round format mounted to card showing a group of elderly gentlemen wearing dark suits, many with  pointed caps and two leaning on canes, standing on a roof top next to a brick tower.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 79th New York Highlanders was originally formed as part of the New York State militia. A wood engraving showing the group marching in Scottish parade dress, created by artist Winslow Homer, was published in Harper's Weekly 329 (25 May 1861). They fought in the defense of Knoxville at Campbell's Station and Fort Sanders in November 1863. This image captures a group of veterans in Knoxville for a Civil War reunion. They are apparently standing on the roof of Bleak House. A monument erected in honor of the 79th NY Highlanders, still stands at 16th and Clinch in the Fort Sanders neighborhood of Knoxville.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of Carrie McGavock</dc:title>
<dc:date>1848</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait of a young dark-haired woman in an off the shoulder dress with lace sleeves seated in front of a red curtain and next to a round marble-topped table.</dc:description>
<dc:description>It is possible that this portrait was done to commemorate the marriage of Carrie Elizabeth Winder (1829-1905) to John McGavock in 1848. Their plantation home, Carnton, on the outskirts of Franklin, Tennessee, was used as a hospital after the Battle of Franklin on 30 November 1864. Carrie McGavock not only oversaw the care of the wounded in and around her house, she was responsible for making sure that nearly 1500 Confederates were reinterred in a cemetery on the McGavock property. She has been immortalized in a fictional portrayal, The Widow of the South, by author Robert Hicks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Small white wooden building with side gable roof, off-center front door topped by a rectangular paneled glass window and shuttered front window.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This white wooden cottage, with carved scrollwork detail below gabled eaves and and gothic arches adorning the square hoods over its single front window and door, was built during the Civil War by John Houston Bills. Bills, a prominent cotton factor, had been a close associate of President James K. Polk. An anti-war Unionist, he built this cottage in the yard adjoining his home, The Pillars, so that his daughter, who was married to Confederate officer Marshall Polk, a relative of James and Sarah Polk's, could move back into town while her husband was away. Sarah Polk's influence assured that Marshall Polk would receive special care and attention after he was wounded during the war. Emmaline and Marshall presented a gold-tipped cane to Sarah Polk in appreciation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This portrait of Sarah Childress Polk (1803-1891) shows her in mourning clothing, which she wore from the time of former President James K. Polk's death in 1848 until the end of her life. The white collar and band on her veil and the brown leather of the distinctive buckle brooch she wears at her neck are the only touches of color in her attire. Sarah Polk remained at Polk Place in Nashville after her husband's death. She was in residence during the Civil War and at the time this portrait was painted by artist George Dury.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is apparently a mourning portrait of Louise Thruston, the daughter of Gates P. Thruston and Ida Hamilton, who died in 1874 at the age of four. She wears an off shoulder white garment and appears as if she is standing inside a cloud. Thruston, a former Union officer, married the daughter of a prominent Nashville family soon after the Civil War. He was a founding member of the Nashville Art Association, predecessor of the Nashville Museum of Art, whose collection now belongs to Cheekwood Museum of Art.</dc:description>

Gaul, born too late to witness the war first hand,  began during the 1880s to create works that reflected the public's interest in remembering the Civil War. He inherited a farm in Van Buren County Tennessee in 1881 and lived there until 1885, visiting and teaching in Tennessee from time to time during the decades that followed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Columbia Female Institute was one of Tennessee's most important schools for young women in the antebellum period. It was founded in 1835 by prominent citizens of Columbia, including Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee James Hervey Otey and Reverend Leonidas Polk. One of its early headmasters, Reverend Franklin Gilette Smith, left the school in 1852 to found the rival Columbia Athenaeum.  The Columbia Female Institute closed in 1862 due to the onset of the Civil War and is thought to have served for a time as a federal hospital during the war. It continued in operation until 1932.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of Jane Erwin (Yeatman) Bell</dc:title>
<dc:date>1861</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait of a dark-haired, middle aged woman wearing black clothing and standing in front of a drapery, with a distant landscape view of a river bend visible to her right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>At the time this portrait was painted, Jane Erwin Yeatman Bell was married to Tennessee Senator John Bell, who had been the Constitutional Union Party candidate for President of the United States in 1860.  Very popular in Tennessee, his party had hoped to maintain the Union without challenging the institution of slavery. Her first husband, ironmaster Thomas Yeatman, had left her a wealthy widow upon his death in 1833. When war came to Tennessee, two of the Yeatman sons remained loyal Unionists, one served as an officer, the other appointed to head the Western Sanitary Commission. The younger son, Henry Clay Yeatman, who had married into the Polk family in Maury County, served as an aide to Confederate General Leonidas Polk. Artist Thomas Waterman Wood (1823-1903), a native of Vermont, trained as an artist in Boston and New York. He came to Nashville in 1859 and created portraits for wealthy and prominent patrons for several years before moving north to Louisville at the onset of the Civil War.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Artist Gilbert Gaul, who is known to have been teaching in Nashville about the time this was painted, may have based in people and places that he knew from near his inherited farm in Van Buren County, Tennessee.  Gaul, too young to have served in the Civil War, created  popular genre scenes and battle images, many of which were published as color lithographs. </dc:description>

The medal highlights both the jutting fortified wall (called a salient) at Fort Sanders  and the deep trench that trapped Confederate troops attempting to scale the wall. Their heroic efforts and the brilliant strategies of Federal engineer Orlando M. Poe who reinforced and strengthened the fort, are honored in the scene depicted here.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This drawing of the &quot;Garden Plan of the Pillars&quot; was created by J.E. Wood, Jr. for the History of Homes and Gardens of Tennessee.  It depicts a seven section garden that is numbered according to a key provided on the drawing.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Houston Bills, a close friend and contemporary of President James K. Polk, added a wing and a second story to this house in the small town of Bolivar, Tennessee, which is located in lower West Tennessee, surrounded by plantation lands. He also designed the home's formal garden. During the Civil War, to which he was heartily opposed, he had cordial relations with Union officers passing through and occupying the town, even as his son in law, Marshall Polk, a nephew of James K. and Sarah Childress Polk, served with Confederate forces. He built a small cottage behind The Pillars, for his daughter Evalina Bills Polk, so that she could stay close to her family while her husband was away at war.</dc:description>

<dc:description>One of a pair of portraits (with Stonewall Jackson) that may have been created in Clarksville, Tennessee, where Newman is known to have lived both before and after the Civil War. The other pair is in a private collection that originated in Clarksville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Artist Robert Loftin Newman, a Virginian who had a studio in Clarksville, Tennessee in 1858, served in the Confederate Army. In 1864, he designed a flag for the Confederacy, which he sent to Jefferson Davis with a letter on March 12th. After the war, he returned to Tennessee and was living in Nashville by the early 1870s, where he called on other artists and prominent former Confederates to assist in his attempt to establish an Academy of Fine Arts.  He spent his final years in New York City, where he had a major exhibition in 1894 at Knoedler Gallery. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville. These beautifully drawn portraits are among Newman's only known Civil War themed works. </dc:description>

<dc:title>Confederate Cemetery Gate, Chattanooga, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:date>1877, 1901- circa 1912</dc:date>
<dc:description>This stone gate and wall have a rusticated castle-like appearance. An inscription on the cornerstone of the gateway arch reads: &quot;Erected in 1901 by the Daughters of the Confederacy, Chapter 81,  Chattanooga, Tennessee, to commemorate the valor and the heroism that our Confederate Soldiers Displayed in the battle for our beloved southland in the war from 1861-1865 in fraternal recognition of N.B. Forrest Camp, UCV.&quot;



</dc:description>
<dc:description>Chattanooga's Confederate Cemetery, which holds more than 1100 Confederate burials, sits on three acres of land adjacent to the City Cemetery. Even though a 30 foot monument within Chattanooga's  Confederate Cemetery was dedicated  by the Ladies Memorial Society on 10 May 1877, this substantial limestone tower and arch and adjacent crenellated wall were not erected until several decades later by a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy ( founded 1894) and a male fraternal organization, the United Confederate Veterans (founded 1889).</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Gutherz, Carl  (1844-1907)</dc:creator>
<dc:title>Sunset after Appomattox</dc:title>
<dc:date>1897</dc:date>
<dc:description>A weary Robert E. Lee sits beside his horse on a fallen log, his hat on his knee, sword and scabbard touching the ground, and ungloved hand to his temple. The pink sky suggests a sunset scene.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This painting of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his horse by Swiss-born artist Carl Gutherz portrays the Confederate general after the April 9, 1865 battle at Appomattox, the final engagement of the war in Virginia. Gutherz positions the general on a large fallen tree, a possible allusion to the fall of the Confederacy. This painting is thought to have been exhibited at the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition. Since it is not in the catalog of the Fine Arts Department or the Womans' Department,  it is likely to have been displayed in Confederate Memorial Hall.  Art historian Stanton Thomas has suggested that this was an effort by Carl Gutherz to create a grand history painting for the Lost Cause audience, an idea possibly suggested by Gutherz's uncle-in-law John Tyler Morgan, U.S. Senator from Alabama.  However, the portrait of the former Confederate commander as tired and vulnerable rather than confident and heroic may not have pleased the public for which it was intended.</dc:description>

Today the section is surrounded by large magnolia trees. </dc:description>

<dc:creator>Gutherz, Carl (1844-1907)</dc:creator>
<dc:title>Missing</dc:title>
<dc:date>1886</dc:date>
<dc:description>A woodland scene with a brightly-dressed dead soldier lying in leaves on the forest floor and a bird on a branch above him.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Carl Gutherz arrived in Memphis with his family from Switzerland in 1860, when he was 16.  His brother Fred joined the Confederate Army as an engineer. Too young to serve, Carl found work as a draftsman for a Memphis arms foundry and is reported to have smuggled contraband for the Confederate troops. After the war, Carl, determined to make an art career, returned to Europe. He was in Paris from 1869 to 1871,  studying for a time at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.  Upon his return to the United States he became an art instructor in St. Louis, helping to establish the St. Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts.  During his second tenure in Paris (1884-1896) he attended the Academie Julian. This poignant depiction of a dead soldier in the woods, who can no longer hear the song of a bird, may have been intended to reference both the American Civil War and the Franco Prussian war. The soldier's uniform bears a resemblance to those of the Zouave units, which were adapted from the French elite soldier corps by both Confederate and Union armies. According to art historian Stanton Thomas, the 154th Tennessee Volunteer Regiment in which Gutherz's brother Fred enlisted was also called the Memphis Zouaves.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of African American Woman and Boy</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1865</dc:date>
<dc:description>This formal studio portrait depicts a well-dressed young African American woman seated in a carved wood gothic chair with a boy about 8-10 years old standing to her left and resting his right arm on her shoulder. The woman is fashionably dressed in fitted gown with black ribbon tie at the collar and embroidered bolero-type jacket. The boy wears  a double-breasted wood or cotton homespun suit and collarless white shirt.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This photograph, likely taken in Memphis soon after the Civil War, may depict former a formerly enslaved young woman and her young son. Both wear serious expressions, and she holds what appears to be a bible in her lap. Commissioning a formal portrait like this one represents the transition into a society free from slavery.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Portrait of Catherine Hunt Holding Hunt Child</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1852-1854</dc:date>
<dc:description>This round black and white photograph depicts a young African American woman holding a white baby.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Catherine Hunt was a slave to the William Hunt Family of Memphis prior to the Civil War. This photograph shows her as a smiling young woman holding a happy white baby close to her chest and nestling his or her head with her cheek.The Hunt home was an imposing brick mansion on the outskirts of downtown Memphis. It served as temporary residence for both Confederate and Union officers during the war and is also thought to have been a Freedmen's School for several years afterwards. Perhaps Catherine had the opportunity to attend the school or even to teach there as Memphis received a large population of ex-slaves from the surrounding area during and after the war.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is the left side of a stereograph. It shows a bearded man in dark jacket and light-colored trousers and boots. He is wearing a flat-topped hat with a wide brim, seated on a rock and balancing a sketchpad on his upraised right thigh and knee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This photograph of British-born artist Alfred Rudolph Waud (1828-1891), a special artist for Harper's Weekly, was taken by Timothy H. O'Sullivan (1840-1882) at Gettysburg. He studied at the Government School of Design in London, then emigrated to the US in 1850. Waud executed action sketches for the New York Illustrated News in 1860 and for Harper's Weekly from 1861 to 1865, covering a great deal of action in the eastern theater as he followed the Union Army of the Potomac. Since photographic reproduction was not yet possible for newspapers, battles were often covered by such sketches, which were quickly converted into wood engravings for publication. Waud continued to produce editorial artwork for Harper's and Century Magazine in the post-war decades.  The Library of Congress owns an extensive collection of Waud drawings and sketches.</dc:description>

<dc:title>His First Vote, 1868</dc:title>
<dc:date>1868</dc:date>
<dc:format>29 in. x 21 in.</dc:format>
<dc:description>This three-quarter length image of a bearded African American man in young middle age shows him holding a folded white paper in his right hand as he moves forward. He stands next to a stone wall that has remnants of former posters or notices, the word &quot;black&quot; incised into the wall and visible at top is what appears to be a sign with the printed words &quot;the polls.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>After Alfred R. Waud's cover image &quot;The First Vote&quot; was published in Harper's Weekly in late 1867, anticipating the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment granting African American males the right to vote, other artists, like Thomas Waterman Wood, picked up the theme.  Here Wood has chosen to portray a young middle aged man with hands worn by work and rumpled clothing and hat. His eyes and expression appear bright and hopeful as he approaches the poll to cast a vote for the first time in his life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Published as a wood engraving, Illustrated London News, 9 August 1862</dc:description>
<dc:description>Foreground shows uniformed men burning bales of cotton. The two-story house in middle ground has inscriptions written across the drawing. Mounted uniformed troops gallop into the scene from around the back of the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Frank Vizetelly was a British correspondent for the Illustrated London News. He wrote on verso of this image, &quot;Cotton Burners on the border of SW Tennessee and Mississippi surprised by Federal Scouts.&quot; Vizetelly described the scene of southern soldiers surprised by Indiana cavalry while destroying bales of cotton as &quot;frightened whites and negroes looked on from the house.&quot; The Confederate government had forbidden the sale of cotton to the &quot;enemy&quot; in 1861. In order to prevent their falling into the hands of those who could prosper from its sale, Confederate soldiers sometimes destroyed cotton stores.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Fred Gutherz and His Mother, Henrietta Luscher Gutherz</dc:title>
<dc:publisher>Peplow &amp; Balch, Star Gallery, Memphis, Tenn.</dc:publisher>
<dc:date>ca. 1860</dc:date>
<dc:description>Studio portrait of a young man standing beside seated middle aged woman. He appears to be about 18-20 years old. On the back of this card is a handwritten poem that begins: &quot;When far in distant lands...&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>This formal portrait of Fred G. Gutherz is inscribed on the back &quot;To Dear Mother.&quot; Although he is not in uniform, this may have been taken just prior to his leaving for war. Gutherz served in the First Tennessee Volunteer Regiment, C.S.A as an army engineer. He later served with the Confederate forces fighting Sherman in North Georgia in 1864. Fred Gutherz left a number of camp drawings from his time of service. His brother, Carl, too young to serve, became well-known as an artist. He commemorated his feelings about the Civil War in artwork, most of which was created many years later.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two crouching figures lead the viewer's eye into a deforested landscape with the remains of a house and chimney. The image is signed in the lower left &quot;Theo R. Davis 1863.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>This image of Lookout Mountain depicts the route of Union soldiers, who came straight up the face of the hill by the Cravens House to capture the strategic location held by the Confederates. The Cravens House is shown here as just a foundation and chimney.  Historian Jim Hoobler believes that Union troops stripped off the wood siding to keep as souvenirs of their heroic victory.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hand-drawn pictorial map depicting part of the fort itself,  the Cumberland River,and the town of Dover. A red line highlights a section labeled &quot;military cemetery.&quot; Below it the word &quot;Freestate&quot;  is written and in parenthesis: &quot;camp of contrabands.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>This document is one of the very few to identify a location and approximate size for a &quot;contraband camp.&quot; Such camps were often found near Union fortifications.  Many African American former slaves and other persons who had escaped through enemy lines sought protection and sometimes employment as Union forces coming into the South. Since Tennessee was in the northernmost portion of the western war theater, some of the earliest contraband camps were established in or around strategic transportation corridors, such as at Dover, at Memphis, and at Grand Junction, an important railroad intersection between Memphis and Corinth, Mississippi.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Reverend William Blount Carter, a Presbyterian minister from a prominent East Tennessee family of Unionists, was a graduate of Princeton University. His brother, Samuel P. Carter, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was commander of U.S. forces in southeastern Kentucky early in the war, and his brother James was in command of the 2nd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. Reverend Carter is widely thought to have played a role in encouraging the bridge burnings by Union supporters in upper East Tennessee in November 1861.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fort Sanders, which sat atop a fortified hill just north of the Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee, was built by U.S. Army troops under the direction of West Point-trained engineer Orlando M. Poe.  Originally named Fort Loudon, Poe suggested changing the name to honor his friend Brigadier General William Sanders who was killed Nov. 19, 1863, ten days before Confederate soldiers were soundly defeated trying to regain control of Knoxville.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Our Country's Flag</dc:title>
<dc:title>Beneath the stars and stripes there stand our sons</dc:title>
<dc:publisher>G. Andre &amp; Company, Philadelphia</dc:publisher>
<dc:date>1861</dc:date>
<dc:description>An illustration of a young man in uniform holding a flag on a staff in front of a line of white tents. Printed below the image are the words &quot;Song Composed &amp; Dedicated to His Excellency Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by G. Gumpert.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>This colorful sheet music cover was published during the first year of the Civil War. Popular music, often played in civic settings, served to build morale as the country mustered for war. It is interesting to note that this song includes lyrics in German, reminding us that many young immigrants and first generation Americans either enlisted or were drafted into the armies on both sides. The young Union soldier holding the flag wears a uniform consisting of a blouse shirt and pants (no jacket) and neither he nor the camp behind him show any signs of the war weariness that set in once the early battles of the Civil War revealed the Confederate army to be a much more serious fighting force than the U.S. Army had anticipated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Studio portrait of a boy who appears to be 8-10 years old, with arms crossed,  wearing a loose uniform, boots, a hat with a tilted brim and badge, and a holster with sidearm.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This image is part of a Civil War glass negative collection at the Library of Congress. A number of cartes-de-visite from Morse's Gallery of the Cumberland, a photographic studio in Nashville, have been recorded. Many depict soldiers. The fact that they are both Union and Confederate suggest that the studio continued to operate during the war, even as Nashville changed hands. Even though enlistment age for Union soldiers was eighteen, some younger boys were admitted with parental consent, while others managed to enter the armed forces surreptitiously.</dc:description>

The &quot;bridge burners,&quot; who believed they had the support of the Lincoln administration and that the United States Army was about to sweep into in East Tennessee and liberate it from Confederate authorities,  were executed for their actions. Master potter 
Christopher A. Haun, who was also among their number, was hanged in Knoxville on 10 December 1861.</dc:description>

<dc:publisher>Harper's Weekly</dc:publisher>
<dc:date>1867</dc:date>
<dc:description>The paintings depicted in these engravings were painted in 1866. The caption indicates that they were photographed for the magazine by &quot;Rockwood.&quot; (?).</dc:description>
<dc:description>Based on the titles, these three images of an African American man portray him as a contraband in ragged clothes, as a recruit with a new uniform and gun over his shoulder, and as a wounded veteran.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This page from Harper's Weekly May 4, 1867, describes three paintings that Wood had on display at the National Academy of Design in New York. According to the text, they were &quot;made from studies in Tennessee during the late war.&quot; Wood was elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design, perhaps on the basis of these works, and moved to New York. He became a full member of the Academy in 1871. In later years he served as President of the National Academy as well as the American Watercolor Society.</dc:description>

This area of West Tennessee, which was near the rail lines at Grand Junction, was occupied by Union troops early in the war. In fact, General Grant ordered the establishment of one of the first contraband camps in Tennessee at Grand Junction.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Morgan, John Hunt, death of</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864-09-06</dc:date>
<dc:description>This telegram was sent by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee, to President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, to report the death of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan at Greeneville, Tennessee on 4 September 1864.</dc:description>
<dc:description>General John Hunt Morgan was surprised by federal troops under the command of General Alvin Gillem in an early morning raid on the Dickson-Williams mansion in Greeneville, Tennessee. He was shot  by a Union soldier after being cornered in a vineyard at the edge of the home's formal gardens. The news of the death of Morgan, who had inspired many loyal followers with raids on Union troops in Tennessee and Kentucky, was important enough to merit sending by telegraph--the fastest means of communication during the Civil War.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Prize Medal for Cotton from the Crystal Palace Exhibition, London, (awarded to Dr. Samuel Bond), 1851</dc:title>
<dc:title>Medal for Cotton, Great Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, London, 1851</dc:title>
<dc:date>1851</dc:date>
<dc:description>This is the reverse side of the medal. It shows what appears to be a toga-clad Roman emperor placing a wreath on the head of a kneeling young woman, while four other women (perhaps representing virtues) stand behind her. The inscription: DISSOCIATA LOCIS CONCORDI PACE LIGAVIT  appears around the top edge of the medal. Type along the bottom edge includes the name of the artist who designed the medal: Leonard C. Wyon.  The name S.Bond is engraved on the edge of the medal.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This medal was awarded to Dr. Samuel Bond, a Memphis cotton producer, who, along with nine other Americans, including fellow Memphian John Pope, won prize medals in the category of &quot;Vegetable and Animal Substances Chiefly Used in Manufactures&quot; at the 1851 world's industrial fair held at the Crystal Palace in London. A commentary in the official catalogue of the exposition noted that all of the cotton on display came from countries other than Great Britain, and that the English writer hoped that soon &quot;encouragement given to the growth of cotton in our Indian and colonial possessions  shall enable us to dispense with the slave-grown cotton of America.&quot; Reference: The Illustrated Exhibitor, A Tribute to the World's Industrial Jubilee (London: John Cassell, 1851), p. 485.</dc:description>

<dc:title>East Tennessee North of Loudon</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864</dc:date>
<dc:description>This black and white topographic map of upper East Tennessee appears to have been folded or bound into a book or booklet.  The text under the map reads: &quot;prepared under the direction of Capt. O.M. Poe, Corps of Engineers &amp; Chief Mil Div of the Mississippi, from data furnished by Capt. O.M. Poe and Professor J.M. Safford.&quot; The map bears the signature of W.L.B. Jenney, Capt. U.S.A.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This map, which shows railroad lines, ferries, roads, and bridges in the upper East Tennessee corridor, appears to have been based upon Tennessee State Geologist James M. Safford's 1855 map of the state, which would have been the most detailed topographic map available at the time. Even though several of Tennessee's railroad lines had been completed prior to 1855, Safford did not show them on his map. When issued, this map might even have been considered confidential, for this information would have been critical to the movement of troops and war supplies for both sides.</dc:description>

Poe was breveted Brigadier General, United States Army, at the war's end. </dc:description>

<dc:title>Fort Sanders, Knoxville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864</dc:date>
<dc:description>This black and white image depicts a tree-stump studded landscape with trench and ramped earth fortification. A section of wooden railing is visible atop the earth mound at right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The landscape in the foreground is now thought by scholars to show a portion of Fort Sanders. It was long thought to have been taken by photographer Sam A. Cooley, of Fort McAllister, South Carolina (near Savannah, GA) because the negative was found in a sleeve labeled Fort McAllister. However, since Cooley is not recorded as having been in Tennessee, the photograph has been attributed to George Barnard, who, as chief photographer for the U.S. Army's  topographical engineers, was headquartered in Tennessee in 1863 and 186.</dc:description>

Pope, who was one of the founders of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad at Bolivar, Tennessee, in 1834, developed some 900 acres of southwestern Tennessee land in the vicinity of Memphis. An innovator and pioneer in the science of farming, he is credited with helping develop short staple cotton as a commodity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This carved white marble bust-length portrait of a middle-aged man with mustache wearing a suit coat, vest, collarless shirt, and tie is mounted on a pedestal.</dc:description>
<dc:description>James Peck Thomas (b. 1827)  was the son of Sally Thomas, a slave born in Virginia (1787-1850), and John C. Catron, a Nashville attorney. Sally Thomas and her two older sons came to Nashville to  live on lands owned by the Thomas family around 1817. Although still a slave, Sally Thomas was able rent a house in the city and take in laundry for pay. She guaranteed the future of her oldest son by sending him to work for a barge captain who acted as intermediary to purchase his freedom.  And she persuaded prominent Nashville attorney Ephraim Hubbard Foster to &quot;purchase&quot; her younger son James with her money, thus ensuring that he could remain in Nashville after an 1834 ruling that all free blacks had to leave the state. In 1851, Foster posted bond for James in order to guarantee his good behavior.  James, who had worked as a barber in Nashville, ultimately made his fortune in real estate in St. Louis. In 1873, he visited Edmonia Lewis at her studio in Rome and commissioned this portrait bus</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hazen's Monument was built of local limestone and constructed by soldiers on the battlefield at Stones River only months after the battle. In 1864, two German-American soldiers/stonemasons from the 115th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Daniel C. Miller and J.C. Bauhof, carved the inscription on the monument.  The south face reads: &quot;Hazen's Brigade--To The Memory of Its' Soldiers Who Fell at Stones River, Dec. 31st, 1862.&quot; &quot;Their Faces towards Heaven, Their Feet to the Foe.&quot; Recognition of those soldiers who fell at Shiloh and the names of the soldiers are found on other faces. The concepts of death and the afterlife centered around the idea of the &quot;good death.&quot; Officers spent countless hours writing to the families of lost loved ones to assure them that the fallen soldier had died bravely {&quot;their feet to the foe&quot;) with a firm belief in the afterlife (&quot;their faces towards heaven&quot;).</dc:description>
