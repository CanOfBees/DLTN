    <dc:description>Modern photograph of an early 19th century house at the site of Buchanan's
     station in Nashville. The log building in the foreground is a remnant from the small fort and
     homestead on Mill Creek founded in 1780 by Major John Buchanan, great-grandfather of John Price
     Buchanan. Buchanan received a land grant in what was then North Carolina, prior to Tennessee's
     statehood. Buchanan Station was the site of an attack by Indians on Sept. 30, 1792 in which his
     wife, Sally Ridley Buchanan, played a heroic part. The structures are now gone and the historic
     site lies under an industrial complex near the intersection of Elm Hill Pike and Massman
     Drive.</dc:description>
    <dc:description>The photograph was taken for the purpose of inclusion in the book, History of

     POLITICIAN by Carol Hoffmann John Price Buchanan is the only man from Rutherford County ever
     elected governor of Tennessee. He was one of those basically unremarkable men who, through a
     strong sense of duty and community service, attain high office. Lacking the charisma of many
     politicians, most notably his predecessor, Robert L. Taylor, he nevertheless brought a
     consistency and thoughtfulness to his term as governor that is deserving of more recognition.
     Although his administration is remembered as one of strife, if should be remembered that to a
     large extent he was a victim of the culmination of long- term problems and the political
     factionalism swirling around him. Buchanan was born in Williamson County, Tennessee. a few
     miles northeast of Franklin, on October 24, 1847. His ances¬tors were among the first settlers
     of the Cumberland; his great- grandfather was Major John Buchanan, founder of Buchanan's
     Station. an early pioneer fort. His father, Thomas, was a prosperous farmer and slave owner.
     The young Buchanan was educated in the common schools of the area and had to gain additional
     education by private study. an experience which probably led to h1s later interest in improving
     the Tennessee 1 public school system. Although his father wanted him to go to college, at the
     age of 16, Buchanan ran away from home and enlisted as a private in Reddy's Escort (4th Alabama
     Cavalry) and was assigned to Nathan 3edford Forrest's command. serving until 65 '. his unit
     surrendered at Pond Spring, Alabama, on May 17. 1865. According to a family story, while
     retreating from a Yankee charge, Buchanan rode under a tree and cut his throat on a hanging
     branch. For a long time he had people believing the Yankee did it, but finally told the truth
     about the cause of his wound, thus missing out on receiving a pension. 2 After the Civil War,
     Buchanan moved to Rutherford county and married Frances (Fannie) McGill, daughter of James and
     Amanda (Norman) McGill, on his twentieth birthday, October 24, 1867. In 1873 they moved to a
     farm on McGill family land which had been inherited by Mrs. Buchanan. Located on the Manchester
     Pike about eight miles southwest of Murfreesboro, th1s became known as the Big Creek Stock Farm
     and encompassed, in 1817, about 160 acres. The Buchanans had eight children (plus one who died
     in infancy): James Thomas, John Price, Jr., Rebecca Jane, Robert Norman, Margaret Dosia, Susan
     Matthews, Prances Louise, and James McGill. 3 Buchanan I B political training and prominence in
     the community began early. He first served as! delegate to the Democratic state convention in
     1876 and continued in this capacity until his gubernatorial nomination in 1890. 4 He also ran
     once for County Court Clerk and twice for District Constable, but was defeated. His start in
     politics was described differently by Buchanan himself in an interview with a reporter for the
     Nashville Daily American the day after he was nominated for governor. According to this story
     he was a delegate to a convention to nominate candidates for the 66 legislature and his name
     was propelled. He declined. but his name was put before the convention a second time and this
     time he was nominated. Having never made a speech before. he told two of his colleague, Mssrs.
     Avent and Sparks, that he had a good horse and buggy and would drive them around if they ....
     could do the talking. At the start of the trip one of the other men became 111 and Buchanan
     began speaking for himself. 6 Actually. he probably began speaking for himself earlier than
     that since in 1881 he chaired a meeting of the Rutherford County Democrats • to resolve that
     the 100- 3 debt settlement (law to fund state debt at full face value by three percent interest
     bonds. with interest coupons acceptable as tax payment) was “a step toward serfdom. 7 However
     it began. Buchanan's fairly short success as a politician cannot be separated from the rise of
     the farmer movement in Tennessee and, indeed, in most of the U. S. Many of the concerns he
     voiced and the legislation he was involved With, both as a representative in the General
     Assembly and as governor, were influenced by the farmer movement and, naturally. by his own
     farm background, and he was to show a remarkable consistency of thought throughout his six
     years in Nashville. In the years following the Civil War, farmers were increasingly burdened
     with declining prices, rising~ costs. overproduction and foreign competition. In addition. they
     felt alienated from the local elites. As a result. several farmers’ organizations were formed.
     (The agrarian revolt in Tennessee was not as profound as in the Deep South because of a more
     even industrial development and les8 dependence on cotton.) The most well-known of these was
     the Grange (Patrons of Husbandry) of which there were Dore than 1,000 chapters 1n Tennessee by
     the 1870’s. As the Tennessee Grange declined 1n membership 1n the early 1880’s, two
     organizations, the National Agricultural Wheel and the ' Farmers' (or Southern) Alliance moved
     in to fill the vacuum. These two groups were united In&quot; December of 1888 as the Farmers'
     and Laborers Union to America. 8 In Tennessee, the two groups were organized at Nashville in
     July, 1889 under the same name (usually called the “Farmers’ Alliance&quot; or simply the
     “Alliance&quot;) as a tax : exempt, chartered bus1. nsS8 corporation and acted a8 a farmers'
     cooperative. By 1890 the Tennessee .Alliance had between 30,000 and 50,000 members. 9 Hot
     initially a political organization, the .1lliance'g main goal was to lessen farmers''
     dependence on merchants. Theoretically, only farmers, farm laborers and country school
     teachers, ministers. physicians and mechanics were allowed to join, but in practice some men of
     property and status became members as they enhanced the .Alliance's social standing. (Buchanan
     himself was the fourth largest landholder in the 25th District of Rutherford County.).
     Specifically excluded was anyone connected by ownership or employment with a mercantile
     business, lawyers and any stockholder in a bank. IO .1 typical Alliance program included the
     following points: 1) Just income tax; 2) popular election of officials; 68 ......... 3)
     regulation of interstate commerce; 4) patent laws; 5) pure food laws; 6) regulation of
     transporta¬tion systems (and ultimate government ownership); 7) free silver coinage) public
     school industrial education and improvement of agricultural colleges; 9) restriction of the
     liquor trade. II Naturally, 1n order to articulate these goals the ! Alliance soon became a
     political force. Starting at the grass- roots level, by 1888 41 out of 132 Tennessee
     leg1818¬tors elected in November of that year were Alliancemen. 12 The next step was to
     recognize that execution of any political program depended on capturing the machinery of the
     Democratic party Which had fallen into the bands of the conservative “courthouse rings&quot;
     after Reconstruction. Buchanan joined the Agricultural Society in 1883. He became the first
     president of the Tennessee Alliance in 1857 and president of the combined Wheel and Alliance in
     July of 1889. The real power in the Alliance, however, was John H. McDowell, vice president of
     the Southern branch of the Alliance and editor or the Weekly Toller (Nashville), the movement's
     principal mouthpiece. Buchanan first went to Nashville as a state representative in 1887. As a
     freshman legislator Buchanan was not especially active but did display interest in topics that
     he would follow consistently during the next six years. They included Civil War veteIl8n's
     pensions. the improvement of the public school system, economical government, the need for a
     new 69 In the Forty-} l' 1! the General Assembly (1887) he introduced House Bills To pension
     certa1n soldiers, which passed with amendments; authored an amendment to a road bill decreelng
     the amount allowed for use of a wagon and team (adopted March 24); and put forward a pet1tion
     from the County Court of Rutherford County relative to redistricting the various countless into
     new school districts. Notably, it was left to N. T. Delaney. of Sullivan County, to introduce
     House Bill 231. To charter the Farmers' and Laborers' Association. He was a member of the
     standing committees on Finance. Ways and Means. Pen1tentiary and Tippling and tippling Houses.
     13 In the 1889 session of the General Assembly, Buchanan became more active. Bills introduced
     included: House Bill 164 (With H. E. Palmer). To carry into effect. Article 4, Section 1 of the
     Constitution (referring to qualification of electors); House Bill 203, To regulate the business
     of banking;&quot; House Bill 239, To &amp; mend the law apportioning the State into
     congressional districts; and House Bill 543. To prevent the location of hosp1tale b; r counties
     and munici¬palities Within the vicinity of charitable institutions maintained by the state. He
     was also influential in the passage of House Bill 233. To exempt agricultural agents from
     privilege tax. Under the heading of “Explanations&quot; Buchanan followed his party and voted
     to support an Appropriation Bill (Senate 70 b Bill 456). but; objected. to a raise in salaries
     for two officials and to spending t4. $4,000 for stationery and voted no on a joint resolution
     to adjourn sine die sine die because there is a quorum present in both Houses and there is
     important business to transact which will require an extra session. and this is both
     unnecessary and inexpedient when that busines8 can now be transacted It (with H. E. Palmer and
     nine others). Committee. memberships in the Port; y- Sixth legislature were Finance. Ways and
     Means and Charitable Institutions (chairman). l. The contest tor the gubernatorial nomination
     was not one of personalities so much as it was a fight among factions of the Democratic party
     which had been in disarray since the Civil War. Three distinct groups had emerged. the
     Bourbons- ¬the Old South, states’ rights conservatives-.. were the 8trongest faction though
     they lost control of the governor's office in 1886. Their leader was Senator Isham G. Harris,
     secessionist leader and Civil War governor. The New South group favored industrialization and,
     because of their resources, enlightened leadership and success in bargaining with the
     Republicans tor patronage and legislation, they had an influence dispropor¬tionate to their
     size. their leader was Colonel Arthur S. Colyar, industrialist, lawyer, and publisher of the
     Nashville Daily American. the third group was the small farm element, or wool- hat boys, who
     looked for their leadership to Buchanan and McDowell (and Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson and
     Robert L. Taylor). l5 71 When McDowell first announced he wanted Buchanan as Governor the urban
     press did not take it seriously. and also questioned the possible conflicts of interest caused
     by Buchanan's association with the Farmers’ Alliance, a problem that would continue to plague
     him until he retired from active politics 1n 1892. Democratic papers stressed the importance or
     party solidarity. In a short article copied from the Obion Democrat at the beginning of 1890.
     the Nashville Daily American wrote. If J. P. Buchanan really means to run for governor he
     should endeavor to escape forthwith from the bands of some of his alleged friends. It may be
     added. without overstepping the bounds of truth or propriety, that the idea of J.P. having any
     symptoms of a statesman borders on the ludicrous. 16 In the campaign leading to the Democratic
     convention of 1890, Buchanan’s relative obscurity proved attractive to farmers and other voters
     since it distanced him from the machine politics they were dissatisfied with. By the middle of
     May, 1890, 28 county Alliances and hundreds of sub- alliances endorsed Buchanan and proved to
     be ready- made campaign organizations which were able to dominate county conventions. 17 In
     Rutherford County he carried three out of six wards in Murfreesboro and, in general, he was
     strongest in Middle and Western Tennessee, winning all the delegates from the Middle Tennessee
     counties of Marshall, Warren, Grundy, Van Buren, White, Stewart and Cannon. 18 The Democratic
     state convention, which was known as tbe &quot;Farmers' Convention,&quot; began on Jul 15,
     1890. Buchanan’s 72 • opponents were Jere Baxter. the New South candidate; Josiah Patterson,
     for the Bourbons: and John Taylor. The Alliance platform was tailored to avoid frightening
     delegates with radical proposals. They pointedly excluded mention of the Sub-Treasury Plan
     which they had long advocated and limited themselves to calling for free coinage of silver, a
     recognition that agrarian interests are the mainstay of a dual system of government, condemning
     the Republicans legislative discrimination against this class. and to con¬demning the granting
     of land to corporations instead of home¬steaders ( the only true Alliance Plank). 19 More
     far-reaching was the regular Democratic party platform. It contained the following points: 1)
     opposed to importation of pauper labor and for opening public lands for homesteading: 2) gold
     and silver coinage and ready conversion of paper money to metal; 3) extension of free school
     system; 4) strict economy and minimum government expenses: 5) Just and equal taxation: 6)
     amendment of lien laws for protection of farmers and mechanics; 7) establishment and
     development of good roads; 8) welcome capital and labor to the state; and 9) modification of
     the penal system to eliminate compet1tion with free labor. 20 Buchanan's name was put into
     nomination by committee Chairman J. D. Richardson and it took 26 ballots before he was declared
     the Democratic candidate for governor. His victory can be seen as being more the result of
     successfully capitalizing on the enmity between the Bourbon and New South groups than because
     of personal popularity. 7) Patterson. Senator Harris and John Taylor threw their support behind
     him because of fear of a Republican victory (and Negro domination) in the fall. Buchanan ' s
     acceptance speech endorsed the principles of the Democratic party: •••• as long as the power of
     speech will endure, I will be heard proclaiming to the people the great principle of Democracy
     as enunciated by Jackson, Polk and Johnson.&quot; He also declared himself opposed to large
     national or state government and for strict adherence to the constitution. 21 Right after the
     convention. in an interview with a Daily American reporter in his room at the Duncan Hotel, 22
     Buchanan expanded on the topic of his loyalty to the Democratic party and stated that the
     interest of farmers lay with the party. I am making this campaign as a Democrat on a Democratic
     platform. I have never urged anybody to support me because I was an alliance man or a farmer;
     in fact, I have never told that I was a farmer in any speech I have made. It is .a grave
     mistake to suppose, as some do, that I am seeking to array one class against another or that I
     want to benefit the agri¬cultural at the expense of other interests. I believe that the farmers
     cannot be benefited by any course which would be oppressive or unjust to other interests. None
     more than the agricultural interest is benefited By the legitimate growth of the mercantile,
     manufac- turing and railroad interests. It is in our interest that the merchants with whom we
     deal be prosperous, that manufactures should be developed, and that transportation facilities
     should be increased and cheapened. We want nothing that would injure any of them, but we want
     to help all and hurt none. I want to be a Governor for the whole people of the State, and you
     know me well enough to know that I will be because I have always been a square, clean,
     upper-case Democrat. 23 He Would return to this theme over and over again in an attempt to
     avoid strong identification with the Alliance, 74 part of his reasoning being that many at the
     Alliance demands were national in scope and had no place in state politics. There was much
     excitement in Murfreesboro when news of Buchanan 's victory at the convention was received. It
     is said that the Court House bell was rung tor nearly an hour, and the Murfreesboro Journal
     went so far as to put out an extra. 24 When he arrived back in Murfreesboro from Nashville on
     July 19 over 2.000 people met him at the depot. A procession had been organized which included
     a pleasure wagon carrying local society ladies and was emblazoned with the slogans,
     &quot;Andrew Johnson from the tailor's bench; Buchanan from the plow,&quot; and &quot; It is
     not wealth, nor pomp, nor state, but git up and git that makes a man great.&quot; The
     procession route started at the train station. went east on Main Street to the Public Square
     and up to Academy Street, north on Academy to College Street, west to Lebanon Street and then
     back to the Square. 25 the gubernatorial contest began in the newspapers before any of the
     candidates (Buchanan; Republican Lewis T. Baxter; and David Cato Kelley, Prohibitionist) hit
     the campaign trail. In the Daily American Buchanan. or &quot;Old Buck&quot; as he was now being
     called, was praised as a man with the courage of his convictions, an able leader of debate in
     the legislature, and watchful of his constituents' interests. It was pointed out, in an effort
     to reinforce his appeal to the farm element, that he was a self- made man, did not have much
     money to spend on politics and that his farm was not well improved and lay in an indifferent
     part of Rutherford County. 26 75 The Republican-controlled Nashville Banner, on the other hand,
     dug up Buchanan’s poor political showing on the local level ( see page 2) and once again
     questioned the influence of the Alliance on Buchanan and the Democratic party Which it
     pictured&quot;••• kneeling down abjectly and taking upon its neck the yoke of a secret class
     political organization, whose pledged policy is in outright antagonism to the time- honored and
     fundamental principles of Democracy.&quot; also pointed out was the fact that the Republicans
     had had to give Up service to some national policies, such as the Force Bill, that were odious
     to the South. 27 Buchanan began his gubernatorial campaign in earnest early in September, 1890.
     Speaking to a crowd in Franklin, Williamson County. his opening speech followed Democratic
     policy closely and was a model for future speeches and for his legislative goals as governor.
     He went on record as being for states' rights and against alien ownership of land. Centralized
     wealth was blamed on the . Republican tendency toward centralized government and could be cured
     by revising the tariffs. breaking the power of the monopolists, free coinage of silver and
     creating a greater money supply. Economy in government was stressed and was used as one
     argument against the Force Bill ( Which called for federal supervision on Congressional
     elections). Buchanan called for the extension of school system facilities and an increase in
     the school term from tour to nine months. His enlightened views on penal reform included
     separating criminal classes and decreasing competition With honest labor. establishment of good
     public roads and the development of resources were also discussed. Finally, again. Buchanan
     stressed that he was wedded to no special interests. 28 Organized out of Democratic
     headquarters in Room 7 of the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville, Buchanan's campaign schedule
     was a busy one. especially considering the transportation facilities of the era. Included in
     the schedule September 5 September 6 September 7 September 8 September 10 September 12

     As in all political contests. rumors and counter-rumors were soon flying. To refute a report
     that the entire Murfrees¬boro bar would vote against Buchanan. the Daily American sent a
     reporter to canvas the membership. He found that of the 25 members. 16 were tor Buchanan. seven
     were against and two were doubtful. 30 77 In reply to the Daily American's claim that thousands
     took part in a procession in Murfreesboro on November 1, the Nashville Banner reported only 204
     people, tour carriages, one drag, two bandwagons, four or five buggies and 60 people on
     horseback. According to the Banner story this group marched around for a half hour then went to
     Mason' s Opera House where transparencies were shown and Buchanan made the same speech as
     elsewhere, on which many people walked out. 31 Election day in 1890 vas on November 4 and the
     results Were as follows. [chart omitted from transcript] The reasons for his victory were: 1)
     continuity of voting habits; 2) organized Alliance support; and 3) the discriminatory effect of
     new election laws. As was true at the state convention, Buchanan's strength was in Middle and
     West Tennessee. After his Victory, he went to Florida to recuperate. 33 Buchanan was sworn in
     as Governor of Tennessee on January 19, 1891. His inaugural address ran true to form. Its main
     points: 78 1. The system of government has fallen into serious errors; violated the principles
     of equality by the undue protection of a favored class. It has made &quot; dangerous strides
     toward plutocracy by submission to the power of aggregated money; it has centralized power
     until it threatens the destruction of popular government and the rights of the States to local
     self-government. It has by these errors fostered monopoly until it has placed itself within the
     merciless grasp of this relentless tyrant.&quot; 2. Tennessee has. on the whole. a good code of
     laws. Care should be taken to enact only needed laws and not overburden the statute books.
     Buchanan believes in the Jeffersonian non-interference theory of government. The weakness of
     the state does not come from inefficient laws. so much as inefficient execution of laws. 3.
     Government should encourage the development of the material resources of the state. Progress
     should not be in “booms” but in growth upon a solid base of an increase in Wealth and taxable
     property. resources and revenues bringing prosperity to everyone. His administration will
     welcome all capital and labor that are for the best interests of the state in the development
     and proper use of resources. Capital should be protected by the &quot; strongest security
     guar¬anteed by law.&quot; The extension and further development of the educational system
     depends on increased material prosperity; crime will decrease as literacy increases. 4.
     Monopolies and sectionalism denounced. 79 In his first message to the legislature, Buchanan
     expanded on the topics covered in the inaugural address and in his previous speeches. the
     emphasis being on education and penal reform ( see Appendix 1 for summary) 35 At first Governor
     Buchanan received praise and support from both Democratic and Republican newspapers. The
     Nashville Banner commended him for presenting a &quot; well- considered and broad- minded&quot;
     message to the legislature and, quoting the Memphis Commercial said, &quot; He has laboriously
     and intelligently addressed himself to his executive duties, won respect, and made friends
     every day since his inauguration.&quot; 36 But trouble wasn't long in coming and Buchanan's
     admin¬istration proved to be one of the stormiest in many years. His problems revolved around
     three issues: 1) the distribu¬tion of patronage; 2) the Coal Miners' Insurrection in East
     Tennessee; and 3) his continued affiliation with the Farmers' Alliance and, especially John H.
     McDowell. As governor, Buchanan tried: • to follow a pragmatic policy designed to build an
     independent base for his party. However, in doing this, he inevitably alienated some of the
     party regulars. Especially galling was the appointment of John H. MoDowell as coal- oil
     inspector of Nashville, a lucrative job ( $8,000 a year vs. only $4,000 for the governor) that
     was seen as payment for his work as Buchanan's campaign manager. It was predicted that
     McDowell's radical Alliance views would reflect badly on the governor. 37 $ a The major event
     of Governor Buchanan' s term of office was the Coal Miners Insurrection which took place in
     East Tennessee, a revolt that had its roots in Tennessee's convict lease system. After the
     Civil War there was a general increase in crime in the South which the impoverished states were
     ill- equipped to handle. Like many Southern states. Tennessee began leas1rlg convicts to
     companies in order to pay for the penal system, and even make a profit. During Governor
     Buchanan's administration the lease was held by the Tennessee coal Iron and Railroad Company at
     $ 100,000 per year. The convicts were put to work in fOI mines and Bub- leased to other mining
     companies in East Tennessee. 38 The convict lease system had long been criticized both tor the
     deplorable conditions under which the convicts were kept and because cheap convict labor took
     Jobs from honest laborers. Conditions were also poor for the honest miners. They were paid in
     scrip. sometimes at irregular intervals, were forced to trade at the company stores and could
     not trust the weighmen employed by the mine companies. These grievances came to a head in the
     summer of 1891 when miners at the Tennessee Coal Company mine in Briceville, Anderson County,
     were told to sign a new “iron-clad&quot; contract which would have left them little better off
     than slaves. The miners refused to sign and on July 5 convicts were brought into Briceville to
     take their place. Ten days later the miners took over the convicts' stockade and took the
     prisoners, their guards and officers to Coal Creek where they were put on a train for
     Knoxville. The same thing happened on July 20. both at Briceville and at the Knoxville Coal 00.
     mine at Coal Oreek. To each uprising Governor Buchanan res¬ponded with state militia -- three
     companies on Jul,. 16. then 14 companies, under General Sam T. Oarnes. Governor Buchanan' e
     general attitude toward the miners. as he told them in an address at Thistle Switch, was that
     be had to enforce the laws and that they should go to court to redress their grievances. . By
     agreeing to call a special session of the legislature to examine the problem. the governor was
     able to avoid bloodshed and he personally. accompanied the convicts back to the stockades at
     Briceville and Coal Creek on July 25. 39 Public opinion. in general, was sympathetic to the
     miners and Governor Buchanan was criticized for being a tool of the industrialists and for
     overreaching his powers by calling out the militia. .11 So , the problems of the convict lease
     system and the miners' grievances were only postponed, not really solved. Governor Buchanan
     called an extraordinary session of the legislature on August 31, 1891. Twelve points were
     enumerated as purposes of the session: 1. give executive disposal of sufficient forces ( civil
     or military) to execute the laws 2. reform penitentiary and convict lease system; 3. prohibit
     use of scrip and penalties for interference with state convicts; 4. amend or appeal state
     election laws; 5. dividing state into representational. senatorial and noterial districts and
     apportioning legislators; 6. amend division of congressional districts so as to include
     Sequatchie County; 7. change judicial circuits and chancery divisions and time of holding
     court; 8. provide for payment of expenses connected with establishing a law court at Cumberland
     Gap; 9. consider appropriation for a Tennessee exhibit at the World's Fair; 10. make laws for
     the encouragement and benefit of the state militia; 11. amend existing revenue and assessment
     laws to pay for Changes bro~ ht about by extra session legislation; 12. make necessary
     appropriations to defray militia expenses at Briceville and Coal Creek. and of the extra
     session. 4O In his message to the session the governor talked at length on the penitentiary
     question and the problems at the mines and recommended: 1) repeal of the lease law; 2)
     immediate restriction of convicts to a few mines through changes in the lease contract; 3)
     change in the criminal law so counties could use minor offenders on public roads; and 4)
     removal of the penitentiary to a location outside the Nashville city limits. 41 The extra
     session was not a success, at least from the miners' point of view. Although a law ' Was passed
     prohibiting payment in scrip. it had a limited term. Primarily. the extra session appropriated
     more more money for the militia and gave the governor limited authority to use them in limited
     situations when the local government could not cope. It did not repeal the lease law, which
     shortly afterwards were upheld by the State Supreme Court ( presided over by Chief Justice
     Peter Turney) In the fall of 1891. the miners rebelled again, this time under the influence of
     a more radical leadership. On October 31. convicts were released at the Tennessee Coal Mine and
     the stockade and buildings burned. This action was repeated at Coal Creek and. on November 2,
     at Oliver Springs. Governor Buchanan was very slow to act and when he did it was only to
     reinforce branch prisons and offer rewards for the leaders of the miners and tor the escaped
     convicts. With the convicts gone. the Coal Creek Valley miners were once again employed with
     the iron- clad contract abolished and their own check- weighman. The peace was not to last,
     however. On December 31, 1891, the convicts were returned to the Knoxville Iron Mine along with
     the militia, a stockade. trenches and a Gatling Gun. In August. 1892, the fourth miners' revolt
     began, this time in M1ddle Tennessee at the Tennessee Coal Iron and Railroad Company mines at
     Tracy C1ty and Inman. Governor Buchanan an::! the prison board issued a joint statement
     declaring the lease contract forfeit, but before it could be carried out there were new
     rebellions at Ol1ver Spr1ngs and Coal Creek. a large militia force suppressed this last
     uprising, this time not without bloodshed. Al though over 300 people were indicted and tried
     after this rebellion, most were acquitted or given minor sentences and the miners were back in
     the mines by the fall. The convict lease system was finally abolished in 1896 when the contract
     ran out. at which time the convicts went to work mining coal tor state use only at the new
     facilities at Brushy Mountain. 42 Buchanan's political career was badly damaged by the Coal
     Miners' Insurrection. He was caught between the business element who considered the strike a
     crime and thought it his duty to enforce the law and labor and reformers ( including the
     Farmers’ Alliance) who considered the system unjust. Some blamed him for negotiating with
     strikers. others tor calling out the militia. He was made to appear the victim rather than the
     master of circumstances. and perhaps he was. The Farmers' Alliance faction of the Democratic
     party was able to get into office only because of the disarray of the regular party; they were
     never fully accepted by party leaders and as soon as the old- line Democrats saw an opportunity
     they began working against Buchanan. The Coal Miners' Insurrection, of course, gave them just
     such an opportunity and they used this and their dissatisfaction with his patronage policies to
     add fuel to their campaign. By late in 1891 Bourbon successors to Buchanan were being
     mentioned, including Chief Justice Peter Turney of Franklin County. By March of l892, 17
     Democratic dailies had declared themselves as opposed to the governor's re-election, 43 and the
     Bourbons had repudiated the leadership of Buchanan and McDowell. Buchanan's primary problem,
     however, was still his relationship with John H. McDowell, ' the Farmers' Alliance and, by the
     Spring of 1892, the newly- formed Peoples' Party of Populists. McDowell was accused of
     fraternizing with Negroes and even with dining with a Negro, Jehazy Cole, which stirred up the
     always- present fear of Republican- Negro domination. Buchanan tried to maintain his position
     by realligning his loyalty to the Democrats and distancing himself from the Populists. He
     thought a third party of agrarians would be detrimental to the South and made a public
     statement of his views in late March. 1892: If you wish a declaration of principles from me.
     look at the Democratic platform of 1890, upon which I was nominated, by Which I pledged myself
     to stand • •• am still standing, and expect to stand until the democracy ••• shall formulate
     another •.• I am opposed to a third party or peoples' party ••• There is need of an unbroken
     front in the ranks of the Democratic party against Republicanism and third partyism. and I
     regret to say that the radical elements in the party are endeavoring to array faction against
     faction. The great conservative masses Will, however, I believe, hold in check these elements
     in accord with the spirit of the call issued by the National Democratic Committee. But the
     damage had been done. The Democratic party was again factionalized as in 1890. but this time it
     did not work in Buchanan' s favor. Rutherford and Tipton Counties 86 each sent two delegations
     to represent them at the gubernatorial convention of 1892 because neither Buchanan nor Turney
     men were strong enough to prevail. Many former Buchanan supporters joined the Peoples' Party,
     thus disrupting the Alliance faction. Some people said they wanted to vote tor &quot; Buchanan
     without McDowell,&quot; but the governor would not break with him. 45 The Peoples' Party, on
     its part, tried to take strength away from both the Democrats and the Republicans. To make
     matters worse. McDowell declared hlmself a Populist and by June 1 Bourbon control was almost
     complete. 46 Realizing his situation vis- a- vis the Democratic party was hopeless, Buchanan
     withdrew from the governor's race on July 3d, 1892. Calling his opponents &quot; sky~ blue
     bolters&quot; and &quot; radicals.&quot; he made a rather bitter speech in which he announced
     he was no longer a candidate for renomination in which he covered the following subjects: 1. He
     has tried to keep the party united but it has now split into hostile factions. 2. He has been
     true to both the Alliance and the party. 3. An organization like the Alliance should be
     nonpartisan but must concern itself with the effects of legislation. The Democratic party
     should promote the interests of all and give attention and consideration to the needs of all
     classes since it cla1ms to be a party of the people. 4. His continued connection with the
     Farmers' Alliance has bound him by no political pledge. 87 5. He has obeyed the policies and
     principles that were enunciated when elected in 1890. &quot;Had a like obedience been rendered
     by all those who accepted its declarations. the party of Tennessee would have continued united
     and harmonious.&quot; 6. The radical faction affected alarm because of the presence of .
     Alliancemen and declared &quot;vindictive warfare&quot; on all who did not agree. They resorted
     to unfair means to secure the party machinery and coerce voters at the primaries. they
     sacrificed party welfare for factional gain. 7. The August 9 convention will be controlled by
     the same elements which are not representative of a majority of voters. B. He thanked his
     friends for their generous and faithful support and released them from any restrictions which
     might be imposed by his continued candidacy. 47 Shortly after, Governor ' Buchanan was drafted
     by a coalition of .Alliancemen, Populists and &quot; Buchanan Democrats&quot; and announced as
     an independent on August 15. The Populists endorsed his candidacy on . August&quot;: 18 The
     other candidates in this race were Peter Turney ( Democratic). George W. Winstead ( Republican)
     and Edward H. East ( Prohibitionist). As an independent candidate, Governor Buchanan’s:
     platform included free coinage of silver, an increase in the currency, popular election of U.
     S. Senators. restriction in agriculture futures dealing, free trade, abolition of national
     banks and prohibition of alien ownership of land. The last two planks of the platform. went
     beyond the ideas or the Tennessee Populists; the whole platform was similar to the Alliance
     platform of 1890. 48 In Southern politics in 1892 it was not unusual for the Republicans and
     Populists to cooperate against the Democrats. In Tennessee, for instance. the Republicans
     offered to withdraw Winstead in return for Populist support of President Harrison. Here again,
     Buchanan became the victim of his loyalty to J. H. McDowell. On October 23, a sensational
     account came ' out ( called the Ivins- Hill letters) concerning a deal engineered by McDowell
     between the Republicans and Populists. According to this deal, the Republican national
     committee agreed to pay McDowell $15.000 for bringing Buchanan into the contest and for aiding
     the Republicans in electing legislators and congressmen. McDowell was to be further rewarded by
     election to the U. S. Senate by the Republlcan/ Populist- controlled legislature. It was
     charged that McDowell failed to live up to his part of the bargain. except for the candidacy of
     Buchanan and, in addition. threatened to withdraw him from the race when the $15,000 was slow
     in coming. 49 This was the final blow to Buchanan's hopes for a second term; although he was
     not implicated he was made to look like a tool of McDowell. The Republican/ Populist fusion
     failed and those who voted for Buchanan in November represented an alienated element of the
     Democratic party, both things combining to seriously weaken Democratic hold of the state for
     several years to come. The total vote in the 1892 gubernatorial election was Turney, 126,348;
     Winstead, 100,577; and Buchanan, 29.916. 50 The Populists won only five out of 99 House seats
     and one Senate seat. 51 In spite of the large number of Alliancemen and farmers in the Forty
     Seventh General Assembly, the legislation produced was rather lackluster. Important acts of
     Buchanan s administration included the declaration of the first Monda,y. in September as a
     legal holiday,.. the creation of a Bureau of Statistics and provision for inspection of mines
     and provision of assistance for Peabody. Normal COllege. A Confederate Pension Bill was
     enacted, first appropriating $ 60.000 ( raised to $100,000 in 1899 and $980,000 in 1923).
     Perhaps most important was the act to establish and. maintain a uniform system of public
     schools-- the &quot; Secondary,. School Law ( Chapter 132, Acts of 1691). Also during
     Buchanan's term•. interest on $469.000 worth of bonds was reduced from six to four percent. 52
     Buchanan's final act as governor was to send a message to the legislature on January, 1893. In
     this message he discussed at length the labor troubles and the status of the prison question.
     revision of the Criminal laws and convict labor. He reported on state finances and expenditures
     and spent considerable time on the public school system, including statistical evidence of its
     growth and development over the preceding teo years. Also reported on were charitable
     institutions and the Farmers' Institutes. finally. he called for 90 a new Constitutional
     Convention, amendment of the election laws and inspection of state banks. 53 Buchanan probably
     realized from the beginning that his governorship might only last one term, depending as it did
     on a critical balance of Alliancemen and lack of unity among old- line Democrats. He followed
     consistent and fairly progressive policies throughout his political career and that his term as
     governor was less than a success was not entirely his fault. Like so many high- ranking
     politicians before and since he became a victim of situations not of his own making and of the
     excesses of a subordinate, in this case, McDowell. His personal character and integrity were
     never seriously questioned. Buchanan had never moved his family to the :: governor I a Mansion
     preferring instead to commute to the city. After completing his term in office he returned to
     farming and stock raising. With the exception of supporting his old enemy, E. W. Carmack,
     editor of the Nashville American in the Prohibitionist campaign of 1908,54 Buchanan was never
     again active in politics. He did, however, retain an interest in politics and was eventually
     accepted again by the Democratic party. 55 As before he went into state politics, Buchanan
     retained an active position in community and agricultural affairs. He was a member of the board
     of the Farmer’s Voice, a ruling elder of the Mt. Tabor Cumberland Presbyterian Church and a
     member of the Free and Accepted Masons. 56 91 In 1925 or 1926 the Buchanans moved into a house
     at 216 Fourth Street in Murfreesboro. Fannie Buchanan died on November 30, 1927. The governor
     was in 1ll health for the last six years of his life and practically an invalid for the last
     two- and- a- half years. Buchanan died on May 14. 1930 and was buried, beside his wife, at
     Evergreen Cemetery. At the time of his death he still owned the farm, but it was divided into
     three sections and the house was torn down in 1953. 57 The Buchanan fam1ly has remained

     Seventh General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, February 11, 1891. ( See Footnote 35) 1.
     Federal Relations There is widespread discontent among agriculturalists, in common with almost
     every other state, ••• result of unjust Federal sectional and class legislation for the last 30
     years. The state legislature is powerless to remove them and also powerless to do anything
     about the short money supply. 2. Finances Congratulated past legislature on the success of the
     assessment law and recommended appointment of a State Board of Equalizers for the purpose of
     more evenly adjusting taxes among the various counties. 3. Educational Interests a. Public
     Schools - The duty of the state to educate children is no longer a debatable question. In towns
     the municipal tax has enabled public school terms lengthened to nine months and a course of
     study to meet lower classes of a college or university, but in the country the term is limited
     to four months on the average and to elementary grades. Recommends extension of the public
     school system, establishment of schools in which higher branches can be taught. uniform
     textbooks and a book on civil government. b. Remuneration for the State Superintendent of
     Public Instruction should be placed on a permanent basis. c. $ 2,000 appropriation for
     teachers' institutes. d. Praise for the University of Tennessee. e. Agricultural College - Must
     assent to additional appropriations by Congress to land- grant colleges under the Morrill Act
     of 1890•. Request for further appropriation for Teachers' Department and • scholarships. f.
     Peabody Normal College - Looking for money from Peabody Board of Trustees. 4. Charitable
     Institutions Need a reformatory for youthful criminals, an industrial school for girls and
     other charities. 93 a. Confederate Soldiers Home is most imperative. b. Private Charities -
     Thanks and gratitude of the State. 5. Agricultural Department There have been attempts to
     abolish the Department from the belief that it has no practical benefits; this is due to
     insufficient funds. a. The Commissioner of Agriculture should hold institutes for the purpose
     of &quot; awakening activity of thought ••• bringing about an interchange of opinions and
     experience upon practical problems, and creating a professional spirit and pride among farmers.
     b. Increase the appropriation from $8, OOO to $lO, OOO. 6. Geological Reports a. Interest in

     usefulness. 95 Appendix 2 Buchanan, James. Interview taped by Jeff Whorley ( grandson) and Dr.
     James Buchanan ( son), 1970 ( transcribed December 14, 1981). This is Jeff Whorley. With me are
     my uncle, Dr. James Buchanan of Virginia Tech and my grandfather, James Buchanan, of Rutherford
     County. We shall talk about my great-grandfather, James Price Buchanan, who was governor from
     of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893 and the only Governor from Rutherford County. Thank you, Jeff.
     That's fine. I think we can have a nice conversation. Actually, I don't recall too much about
     my grandfather. I was about 13 years old when he died. It was about 1933 as I remember. I
     remember mostly an old man with white whiskers who used to bump me up and down on his lap and
     sing something about &quot; chicken foot neck and a gizzard&quot; and a few things like that; a
     man, however, Whom everybody respected a great deal even in his old age. I also remember as a
     boy about your size I used to wander around upstairs in the old big house which unfortunately
     is no longer here and find all of this literature about his political campaigns, all about the
     Farmers' Alliance and the Wall Street robber barons and so forth during the Populist period
     which he was the representative of in the State of Tennessee. I think they actually elected
     something like six governors in 1890 which was a rather strange phenomenon. The Farmers'
     Alliance party rather than the regular Democrats. Jeff, &quot;What I suggest is that you ask
     Papa what he remembers about the governor. Papa, what do you remember about when your father
     was governor?;: l Tell us about it. James Buchanan Well, I was almost too small to know much
     about when he was governor, but something happened that made an impression on me about that
     time. You know the state hadn't been working prisoners in the mine up there up till about the
     time he was governor and they sent some state prisoners up there and the miners resented it and
     they undertook to run them off. They had to call the state militia and there was some bloodshed
     along about that time at Brushy Mountain, Inman. H. R. Bradley. my uncle by marriage. was
     Superintendent of the mines then and had to ____________ brought that all up, you know, about
     calling the state militia out to fight the people who lived there, who made a living by mining.
     ' that' s about all I remember now. What about after he was governor? What about you taking him
     to the train at Rucker? James Buchanan I went about every other day to Rucker for so many
     years. while he stayed in politics. And I was just a little shaver and l'd ride behind him to
     Rucker and get him on the train and I’d put on a show coming back. He'd tell me be sure not to
     ride them horses fast and l'd stand up in the saddle and put a regular show on. People would
     come out and say yonder come that little ole Buchanan boy. He's going to get killed. Lord have
     mercy. he's going to get killed. Then you went back and got him at night. And I'd go and get
     him in the evening. you know. and I had to ride about five miles in the dark. Scared. oh, and I
     had to go by a church and a graveyard and you talk about going, I was moving on. I passed that
     graveyard and I heard somebody holler. Away I went and he hollered at me again a little louder
     and a little louder. Finally. he caught up with me. He’d got a train that stopped about halfway
     between Rucker and Christiana. He made them back up and put him off and he got a man and a
     buggy and horse and caught me over there. Like to scared me to death. But I made it home and
     I'm here now. Was the governor in the Civil War? Yes, he was in there the last year. run away
     from home and joined the last year of the war. They went to Alabama. They fought one year in
     the war. He was only 16 years old at the time. Wasn't there something about running under a
     bush and cutting his throat? Yes. The Yankees was charging and they were running. They had them
     cut off from the main beginning and he run under a tree with a great bamboo stringing down and
     caught him under the chin and cut his throat from one side to the other, and he went in first
     and told them he got cut by Yankees and had them believing it for a long time. If he hadn't
     finally told up he could have been drawing a pension. What about the Farmers' Alliance party?
     Was it an offset of the Democrat party? James Buchanan That Farmers' Alliance. now let me see.
     There wasn' t nothing on earth but sort of a farmers' union and they never could get organized
     again. That was the beginning of the farmers union. Dr. Buchanan After his term the Democratic
     party sort of took him back in again, didn't they? 97 .. After he got beat? Yes. What sort of
     politics did the governor stay in after his term in office? Did be ever run for anything else?
     He liked to hang around Nashville. He was always a politlcian. Stayed in politics as long as he
     lived. Was the governor a good farmer? James Buchanan Yes, he must have been pretty good to
     raise eight children on the farm. Must have been a pretty fair farm. 98

    <dc:description>Tuesday, February 8, 1977 Sidelines Page 5 Misapplication of Keynesian theories
     faulted Objections have been raised to using Keynesian tools in democracy because Keynes was
     not a democrat, national economist James Buchanan said last night. Speaking to over 100
     persons, Buchanan said the &quot;political democracy may not be able to survive the Keynesian
     test.&quot; The Keynesian idea aimed at the 1930's was concerned with unemployment and demand,
     Buchanan said. The policy followed was to create a deficit to create more spending. ' 'We did
     not apply the Keynesian principles properly, the MTSU graduate said. The Keynesian teachings
     were a &quot;gross intellectual oversight by persons in these ivory towers because they
     overlooked democracy, &quot;Buchanan maintained. The Keynesian principles may &quot;yet be
     judged a curse.&quot; The Post-Keynesian thinking is not the answer to the nation's economic
     problems. It just doesn't work anymore. Instead, the economist proposed that a set of
     constitutional rules be established. The constitutional rule &quot;would put us on the record
     as saying that's what we want.&quot;Presently, there is not much hope of a constitutional rule
     but Buchanan would not rule out the possibility. Buchanan predicted the nation's deficit would
     reach $85 billion during the 1978 fiscal year. For persons who believe the budget may be
     balanced in 1981, Buchana is skeptical. &quot;It is just the never, never land of
     politics.&quot;Voters want reduced taxes and more federal spendings so that the politicians
     respond. &quot;The politicians create the deficits and the economists five excuses,&quot; he
     commented. In the five-year period between 1971-1975, the federal budget exceeded revenue by
     $110 billion, Buchanan said. During the period of 1975-76, the deficit was more than the
     five-year increase.Over the next five years, the deficit will reach between $250 to $500
     billion, the economist predicted. &quot;My charge is that the Keynesian economy is incompatible
     with the political economy,&quot; he said. &quot;Must we allow ourselves to destroy our
     institution?&quot; The popular notion that the &quot;trade-off&quot; of inflation and
     unemplo3Tnent would balance each James Buchanan other doesn't work anymore, he added. Balancing
     the budget over the business cycle and allowing the revenue to build up to a surplus is
     irrelevant, Buchanan said. As a means to curb unemployment, Buchanan said the repeal of a
     minimum wage law for teen-agers would cause the unemployment rate to decrease two percent
     overnight. MTSU photo by Pat Daley</dc:description>

     NASHVILLE Nashville TAVEL, EASTMAN &amp; HOWELL, 1898. 300 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE XIII.
     EXPLOITS OF MAJ. BUCHANAN, FOUNDER OF BUCHANAN'S STATION. MAJ. JOHN BUCHANAN was born at
     Harrisburg, Pa., January 12, 1759. His father was of Scotch-Irish descent. His mother's maiden
     name was Jane Trindle. The family consisted of three sons, John, Samuel and Alexander; and two
     daughters, Sally, who married James Todd, and Nancy, who married James Mullherrin. This family
     removed from Harrisburg to North Carolina, but remained only a few years in that State. Thence
     they went to Kentucky, and settled where the town of Danville now stands. After remaining there
     four years, they, in company with friends, came to Tennessee, making the trip through the
     wilderness to the Cumberland river opposite the mouth of Lick Branch. It was in the early part
     of December, during a very cold season, and they found the river frozen over, but were
     compelled to wait until the ice was sufficiently hard to bear their weight before they could
     cross, which was finally effected on 14th of December, 1778. They found Gen. James Robertson
     and family and one other family living in humble log cabins on the bluff near where the county
     jail now stands, then called the Spout Spring. from which Spring ( Church) street took its
     name. Gen. Robertson and Maj. Buchanan found in each other the elements for a confidence that
     ripened into a lasting friendship. The third log cabin was soon erected for Maj. Buchanan,
     while accommodations were provided for the other members of the new accession to the
     settlement. Maj. Buchanan was a surveyor and hunter, and these pursuits constantly called him
     into the woods, thus enabling him to gain a thorough knowledge of the Indian character- their
     sagacity, their treachery. and their blood- thirsty purposes against the white settlers.
     Robertson and Buchanan immediately set about erecting a fort for protection and defense against
     the depredations and at¬tacks of the Indians, and shortly after its completion, Indian “signs”
     were reported to have seen seen near the fort. On the 301 Old Times in Tennessee 2d day of
     April, 1781, a desperate effort was made by the Indians to take this fort. A numerous body of
     Cherokee warriors came in the night and lay around in ambush. In the morning three of them came
     in sight, and fired at the fort and immediately re • treated. Nineteen horsemen in the fort at
     once mounted their horses, and, under the lead of Maj. Buchanan, followed them in a southerly
     direction. When they reached the steep and abrupt banks of the branch emptying into the river
     above the present city wharf ( now known as Wilson's Spring branch), a few In¬dians were seen
     on the opposite side of that stream hiding behind trees and making demonstrations as if
     preparing to give battle. It appears that this was only a ruse to decoy the men from the fort,
     for a considerable body arose from their concealment and fired upon the horsemen. The latter
     dismounted and gave them battle, and returned their fire with great alacrity. Another party of
     Indians lay concealed in the cedars ready when the fighting should commence at the branch to
     rush into the fort in the rear of the combatants. The horses ran back toward the fort, leaving
     their riders on foot to fight their way out as best they could. To guard against the expected
     assault from the Indians against those in the fort, its gates were closed, and preparations
     made for defense. Meantime the battle raged without. Retreat was cut off by the party concealed
     in the cedars, and the position of Maj. Buchanan and his men was extremely critical. The
     Indians were advancing upon them rapidly on either side, and there was no time for consultation
     and concert of action in whatever course it might have been thought best to pursue. It was a
     crisis when each man had to act upon his own judgment. Emptying the contents of his rifle in
     the breast of an advancing Indian, Maj. Buchanan rushed to the bluff at the river for the
     purpose of gain¬ing shelter while reloading his gun. An Indian having discov¬ered his place of
     retreat, approached very cautiously to the edge of the bluff, and began peer about in the hope
     of discovering the Major's hiding place. While thus engaged, Buchanan sent a ball crashing
     through his brain. Loading his gun again quickly, he started for the fort, but before reaching
     the brow of the bluff he discovered an Indian coming bounding like a frightened antelope in the
     direction where he stood, but apparently having his attention fixed in an opposite direction.
     The trusty rifle was again leveled 302 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE and another redskin fell before
     Buchanan’s unerring aim. While the Major was thus engaged, his companions were fighting with
     equal desperation and quite a number of Indians fell before their deadly aim. In this
     engagement five of Buchanan’s men were killed, his brother Alexander being of the number, and
     two badly wounded. One of them (Isaac Lucas) had his thigh broken by a ball. His comrades had
     gotten within the fort and the Indians rushed on him to take his scalp. One of them running
     toward him and being but a short distance from the supposed victim of this barbarous revenge,
     was fired upon and shot through the body by Lucas, who, with rifle well charge, was lying
     unable to rise from the ground. The Indian died instantly. Those in the fort, in order to save
     Lucas, kept up a brisk fire upon the pursuing Indians, and finally drove them off, when Lucas
     was brought into the fort. “Among those who escaped toward the fort” says Ramsay, “was Edward
     Swanson, who was so closely pursued by an Indian warrior as to be overtaken by him. The Indian
     punched him with the muzzle of his gun, and pulled trigger, when the gun snapped. Swanson laid
     hold of the muzzle, and wringing the lock one side, spilled the priming from the pan. The
     Indian looked into the pan, and finding no powder in it, struck him with the gun-barrel, the
     muzzle foremost; the stroke not bringing him to the ground, the In¬dian clubbed his gun, and
     striking Swanson with it near the look, knocked him down. At this moment Maj. Buchanan, seeing
     the certain death that impended his comrade, gallantly rushed from the fort to the rescue of
     Swanson. Coming near enough to fire, he discharged his rifle at the Indian, who gritting his
     teeth on receiving its contents, retired to a stump near at hand. Buch¬anan brought Swanson
     off, and they both got into the fort with¬out further injury. From the stump to which the
     wounded warrior retired, was found after the Indian forces had withdrawn, a trail made by the
     body dragged along the ground much marked with blood. When the Indians fired upon the horsemen
     at the branch, the party of them lying in ambush in the cedars, rose and marched toward the
     river, forming a line between the com¬batants and the fort. Meantime, when the firing between
     the dismounted horsemen and the enemy had commenced, the horses took fright, and ran in full
     speed on the South side of the Indian 303 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE. Line toward the French Lick,
     passing by the fort on the bluff. Seeing this, a number of the Indians in the line, eager to
     get possession of the horses, left their ranks and went in pursuit of them. At this instant the
     dogs in the fort, seeing the confusion and hearing the firing, ran toward the branch and came
     to that part of the Indian line that remained yet unbroken, and having been trained to
     hostilities against the Indians, made a most furious onset upon them and disabled them from
     doing anything more than defending themselves. Whilst thus engaged the whites passed near them,
     through the interval in the Indian line made by those who had gone in pursuit of the horses.
     Had it not been for these fortunate circumstances, the white men could never have succeeded in
     reaching the fort through the Indian line which had taken post between it and them.&quot; The
     Indians finally retired, and although their loss could never be ascertained, it must have been
     considerable. Shortly after this incident, Maj. Buchanan went out hunting&quot; on Richland
     creek, several miles west of Nashville. Having the luck to kill a young doe, after skinning and
     selecting the choice pieces take home with him, he converted the hide into , a knap- sack in
     which he placed his venison. Throwing this knap- sack over his neck and shoulders, he commenced
     to retrace his steps toward home. The country was covered with a heavy growth of cane and pea-
     vine, through which the buffalo had beaten a track from Richland creek to the French Lick, now
     called the Sulphur Spring. Maj. Buchanan was returning by this path, and at a point some
     distance out, he came to where a tree had fallen across the path, and the buffalo had made a
     path around the top as well as the root of this tree. As he approached the spot, he turned to
     the left, and just at that moment he heard the voices of Indians coming around by the right. To
     his aston¬ishment there were seven Indian warriors within twenty feet of him, who had that day
     stolen two boys from the fort, and had these boys with them. Before the Indians discovered him,
     Maj. Buchanan shot the leader dead, which so frightened the others that they took to their
     heels in a wild scamper through the bush, cane, and pea- vines, the two boys running with their
     Indian cap¬tors, fearing that they would be killed if they attempted to escape. The Major
     retreated in a different direction. On his arrival at 304 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE. home the next
     morning, a company of men started out in pursuit of the Indians to recover the hays if
     possible. They found Maj. Buchanan's venison where he had thrown it off at the fallen tree, the
     camp where the Indians had spent the night, and a new made grave where they had buried their
     companion who had been killed by Maj. Buchanan, but they did not succeed in recovering the
     boys. Several years afterward the younger of the boys came home and reported that the night
     after Buchanan had killed the Indian, his brother made his escape and ran down Richland creek.
     One of the Indians followed him, and returned about daybreak bringing his brother's scalp with
     him, which he showed. to the younger brother, and told him that if he attempted to run off, he
     would kill and scalp him. The boy remained with the Indians a long time before he succeeded in
     getting away. They treated him very kindly, but made him stay with the squaws and children and
     work. These boys were named Clayton. After his return from captivity, young Clayton and another
     young man, named Gee, were out on a scouting tour in the direc¬tion of the Big BlackFox camp, a
     noted Indian camping ground, near where Murfreesboro now stands, and as they were riding
     through a dense cedar forest about two miles East of the present site of Lavergne, they were
     fired on by a party of Indians and killed. They were not found until several days afterward,
     and then by attention having been attracted by the hovering of buzzards about the spot where
     their bodies were lying. Maj. Buchanan was married twice- first, in 1786, to Miss Mar¬garet
     Kennedy, who bore him one son and the second time in 1791, to Miss Sally Ridley, daughter of
     Capt. George Ridley, who bore him nine sons and four daughters. After remaining four years in
     Nashville, he located on Mill Creek, where the Tennessee and Pacific Railroad crosses that
     stream, four miles from the city. The place is known in tradition and history as Buchanan's
     Station, and is memorable on account of having been attacked about midnight on the 30th of
     September, 1792, by about nine hundred Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw warriors, who were held at
     bay and finally repulsed by twenty- one in the fort. This repulse has been pronounced a feat of
     bravery which has scarcely been surpassed in all the annals of border warfare.&quot; The
     following are the names of the men who were in the fort, 305 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE and who
     acted with such conspicuous bravery on that occasion: Maj. John Buchanan, James Bryant. Thomas
     Wilcox, James O'Connor, Robin Castleman, James Mulherrin, Thos. McCrory, Morris Shane, William
     Kennedy, Robin Kennedy, Samuel Blair, Jo. DuRat, George Finalson, Charles Herd, Sampson
     Williams, John Castleman, Samuel McMurry, Robin Turnbull, Thomas Latimore, Robin Hood, and
     Rohin Thompson. Some three or four months before this battle, George Finalson, a Frenchman, and
     Jo. DuRat, a half- breed, who were on terms of intimacy with the Indians as well as the white
     settlers, and en¬tertaining the warmest sympathies for Maj. Buchanan, deter¬mined to
     communicate to him the purpose of the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw Indians to unite their
     forces, attack and destroy his fort, and after murdering those who had taken refuge in that
     place, march on to Nashville and capture the town, and then di¬vide the plunder they might
     secure. On learning the purpose of the Indians, Maj. Buchanan set about repairing and
     strengthen¬ing his feeble fortification. About five hundred State troops had been ordered to
     Buchanan's Fort to meet and repel the Indians. The time at which the Indians were to have
     attacked the fort having passed, and no sign of their coming, the matter was looked upon as a
     ruse on the part of Finalson and DuRat to get up a little excitement, or that they were
     themselves unduly excited, if not frightened, the troops were disbanded the Friday previous to
     the attack on Sunday night. Maj. Buchanan, however, pre¬vailed on a number of his friends to
     remain with him, having the fullest confidence in the information given him by Finalson and
     DuRat touching the purpose of thc Indians, which was fully verified within three days. The moon
     was full the night of September 30, and unobscured by even the smallest cloud. As the clock
     struck the hour of twelve, two faithful sentinels at the entrance gates descried in the
     distance the approach of the Indians. The sentinels awaited their coming until they were within
     easy range, when the sharp report of two rifles rung out upon the still air of that bright
     moonlight night, the one killing the Cherokee chief and the other severely wounding the
     celebrated Choctaw chief John Watts, who was shot through one thigh while the ball lodged in
     The other. The Indians returned the fire, and continued a constant 306 OLD TlMES IN TENNESSEE.
     stant and very heavy fire upon the fort for an hour. A few yards from the fort a cellar had
     been dug out over which a house was soon to be built. The Indians took refuge in this as a safe
     re¬treat, from which ' they hoped to he able to pick off the men in the fort as opportunity
     should present. The block- houses were so constructed as to give the whites a decided
     advantage, which was improved with telling effect by some expert riflemen from the upper
     portholes. Whenever an Indian raised his head above the ground sufficiently high to be seen, he
     was sure to be picked off by one of the expert shots in the fort. Many were the bloody traces
     made by hurriedly dragging the bodies of dead Indiams down the rough, rocky declivity from that
     fatal spot. The prin¬cipal burying ground of the Indians was at the lower extremity of Todd's
     Knob, near the mouth of Stone's river, on the farm now owned by Maj. David H. McGavock, and
     numerous are the graves yet to be seen containing the bones of red men who fell in the
     sanguinary attempt to take. the fort on that memorable night of Sept. 30, 1792. Prior this
     attack, Maj. Buchanan’s sagacity and apprehension of the purpose of overriding and de¬stroying
     him, put him actively on his guard against surprise, and he was at all times fully prepared to
     meet any emergency. The fort was repaired and strengthened, blockhouses built, guns cleaned up
     and placed in position for use at a moment's warning, powder- horns filled, bullets moulded and
     stored in convenient. places; and although the spring was but a few yards distant from the
     fort, to guard against a siege, all vessels for holding water were carefully filled and
     conveniently arranged for use should necessity require. So that when the Indians came he was
     fully prepared for them. The attack being made at midnight, the in • mates were all in bed and
     asleep, except the two sentinels on guard at the outer gate, and when these faithful sentinels
     dis • charged their guns at the advancing Indians, every man and woman in the fort was soon at
     the post of duty. The attack was so sudden and the emergency so great that no time was lost by
     the inmates of the fort in dressing, and they commenced the fight with only the clothes on-
     many in only their under gar¬ments- in which they had retired for the night. One lady fear •
     ing capture, and believing the women and children would not be killed but carried off, dressed
     herself and children So as to be 307 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE ready for the fate that awaited
     them. James O'Conner, who was one of the inmates of the fort, was a gallant son of the Emerald
     Isle, as his Irish brogue clearly indicated, but was much addicted to strong drink. He had that
     day been to Nashville, and had imbibed just enough make him quite lively. He had returned to
     the fort only about an hour before the attack by the Indians. While the battle was at its
     hottest, Jimmy O'Conner appeared before Maj. Buchanan and asked permission to use an old long
     pistol owned by the mother of the Major, and usually kept loaded and laid away under the old
     lady's pillow. His request was granted and Jimmy was soon at an upper port. hole, which was
     reached by means of a ladder, and thrusting his blunderbuss, which was known as &quot; My
     Grandmammy's Pocket Piece,&quot; through the port- hole, pulled trigger, and supposing that he
     had fired, and that at least one Indian had been made to “bite the dust,&quot; returned to the
     Major for another load. This&quot; pocket piece&quot; required just four times the quantity of
     powder that an ordinary rifle did. Jimmy repeated his visit to the Major for “another
     load&quot; for the fourth time, thinking he had fired each time. At the fifth trial his
     blunderbuss went off, with a report , akin to that made by a six- pounder, and “sending poor
     Jimmy backward from the top of the ladder to the floor, a distance of eight feet, and
     inflicting a severe bruise on his shoulder. No sooner had he reached the floor than he was up
     and on his feet again, and going the Major, he exclaimed with all the enthu¬siasm of his
     nature, &quot; Be jabbers, I give it to ' em; but she give me a tremendous pounce!&quot; The
     night was quite cool, especially to those who were dressed only in their night clothes. Mrs.
     Sally Buchanan was kept busy in furnishing the men with powder and bullets, and occasionally
     she warmed up their spirits with a &quot; dhrop&quot; of Jimmy O'Conner's favorite beverage.
     Mrs. Buchanan was large, active, cheer¬ful, brave, and daring, knowing no fear and shunning no
     respon¬sibility; with a strong mind, generous impulses, and sensitive to the wants of the
     suffering. She was well calculated to encourage the little band then defending the fort deeds
     of great bravery. During the fight Mrs. Buchanan observed one man shirking duty. She approached
     him and asked resolutely, &quot;What are you doing there, Tom? Why are you not fighting?&quot;
     And then she 308 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE Added with emphasis, “I would rather be killed fighting
     like a man, than be crouching in a corner like a coward. Go to your gun this instant, for your
     own credit’s sake” Of course such a speech had its desired effect. The lady who had dressed
     herself and children, was so completely the victim of fear that she left her room and advanced
     toward the gate of the fort. Mrs. Buchanan seeing her leading her children along, hastened to
     her side and inquired, “What in the world are you going to do, Phoebe?” “To surrender” was her
     reply. “Never” exclaimed Murs Buchanan, “as long as there is life in this body. Go back to your
     room and keep out f the way; we will whip the Indians? And back Phoebe went with her children.
     Mrs. Buchanan was frequently by the Major's side during the engagement, to see that his orders
     were promptly executed, while she occasionally visited every part of the fort to encourage the
     brave men upon whose coolness and intrepidity so much depended. Never were husband and wife
     better suited to each other, or possessed in a greater degree the traits which lead to heroic
     daring—even in those days when these traits were so conspicuously developed in men and
     women—than were John and Sally Buchanan. It is a memorable incident that eleven days after this
     engagement Mrs. Buchanan gave birth to her first child. In an account of the attack on
     Buchanan’s Station in a letter to the Secretary of War, Gov. Blount says: “Their (the Indians’)
     approach was suspected by the running in of cattle that had taken fright at them, and upon
     examination, they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate; from this place
     and and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them (John McRoy).
     They immediately returned the fire, and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the
     station (block-houses surrounded with a stockade) for an hour, and were repulsed with
     considerable loss, without injuring man, woman, or child in the station. During the whole time
     of the attack the Indians were not more distant than ten yards from the blockhouse and often in
     large numbers around the lower walls, attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with
     a torch, where he was shot, and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom
     logs, and was killed. The Indians 308 OLD TIMES IN TENNESSEE Fired thirty balls through a
     port-hole of the overjutting, which lodged in the roof in the circumference of a hat, and those
     sticking in the walls on the side were very numerous. Upon viewing the ground next morning, it
     appeared that the fellow who was shot from the roof was a Cherokee half-breed, and there was
     much blood and signs that many dead had been dragged off, and litters having been made to carry
     their wounded to their horses, which they had left a mile from the station.” The loud report of
     “My Grandmammy’s Pocket Piece” in the hands of Jimmy O’Conner impressed the Indians with the
     belief that the whites had a cannon in the fort, and caused them to retreat sooner perhaps than
     they otherwise would have done. So much for the part the Pocket Piece played in this memorable
     engagement. For sixteen years after his settlement on Mill creek, Maj. Buchanan was compelled
     to keep a guard constantly on watch for the protection of those who cultivated his farm. His
     brother Samuel was cut off from the guard whilst plowing and wounded. His old father was shot
     down in his own house by a band of Indians while the men were out at work. Mrs. Sally Buchanan
     died Nov. 23, 1831 and Maj. John Buchanan, Nov. 7, 1832 and both were buried in the family
     graveyard near the site of the old fort.</dc:description>

     The following was found in a compilation produced and published by J. J. Fox, Fox Books, 9
     Precipice Road, Camden, SC 29020 and E. F. Williams, EFW Commercial Ventures, Inc., P. O. Box
     241813, Memphis, TN 38124. The compilation includes articles printed in &quot; The Annals of
     the Army of Tennessee and Early Western History&quot;, which seems to have been edited and
     published regularly circa 1878 for at least ayear, by Dr. Edwin L. Drake, Lieutenant­Colonel,
     C. S. A. It primarily contains descriptions of battles and personal experiences of the Civil
     War, much of which pertains to areas not of Rutherford County or Middle Tennessee. However,
     there were also articles concerning the recollections of early pioneers in Tennessee. The
     following, written by Thos. Washington, is about Buchanan's Station, located on Mill Creek in
     Davidson County, which was formed in 1783. Many of the participants in this article resided in
     what later became Rutherford County. &quot; The attack upon Buchanan's Station, as Mr.
     Tannehill [ of the Tennessee Historical Society at that time] informs me was made in September,
     1792. Since I heard that this subject was under investigation by this Society- that i~, within
     thr~ . or}~ ur Y'eeks past-: I wrote to Constantine Hardeman, of Rutherford County, requesting
     him to'inforni me of the date of said attack. Constantine Hardeman is ason of the late Thomas
     Hardeman, who was the owner of the place at which Hardeman's Station was established ( it being
     the place owned by the later Robert C. Foster), and situated within one mile of Buchanan's
     Station. Mr. Hardeman did not answer my letter, but he called upon me in afew days after its
     reception and stated that he could not undertake to give the exact date of the said attack on
     Buchanan's Station; that he remembers the event perfectly well; was in Hardeman's Station at
     the time; heard the firing of arms when it commenced and throughout its continuance; thinks
     that he was then about fifteen years old, and says that he was bom in the year 1778- which, if
     correct, would place the date of the attack in the year 1793. Mr. Hardeman says, further, that
     although he was then old enough to be capable of shooting arifle at squirrels, etc., he was
     considered too small to be of any service in defending Buchanan's Station, and was left at
     Hardeman's Station, while he mentions anumber of others who went from the latter station to the
     relief of the former, all of whom are now dead. He refers me to Benjamin Bashan, of this
     county, as being a man who can probably assist me in ascertaining the date of the attack upon
     Buchanan's Station; and, also the widow of the late Thomas Buchanan, a sister of the said
     Benjamin Bashan, whom he describes as being awoman of remarkable memory.... &quot; Thos.
     Washington continues- NOTE: Since the above was written, I have seen and conversed with Colonel
     Moses Ridley, of Rutherford County, on the subject of the attack upon Buchanan's Station. He is
     a son of the late George Ridley, of this neighborhood, and a brother- in-law of Major John
     Buchanan, afterwhom and at whose residence the station was called and situated. Colonel Ridley
     says that he was between ten and eleven years old when the attack was made, having been born in
     June, 1782. That he remembers the event perfectly well, and grew up among those who were in the
     station at the time; that it was aprominent event in the history of the country, and that he
     has heard its incidents so often narrated, that they have almost become identified with his own
     existence. Colonel Ridley says that his impression is that his sister's son, George Buchanan (
     his sister being in the station at the time of the attack), was born from ten to fourteen days
     after the attack; that, recollecting that fact, he made search for the family Bible of Major
     John Buchanan, in order to ascertain his son George's age, and found a copy of that part of the
     bible where the ages of the children are recorded in the possession of Henry Buchanan, another
     son of the said Major John Buchanan. According to that copy, which I have seen, George Buchanan
     was bom on the 11iii day of October 1792. And in the same copy the exact date of the attack on
     Buchanan's Station is given, as being set down among the ages of Major Buchanan's children; and
     according to that record, it was the 30th of September 1792. Colonel Ridley also produced to me
     a copy, as taken from a copy of said family record kept by Thomas Everett, ason- in- law of
     Major Buchanan, in which the birth of George Buchanan is set down as having occurred on the
     11th day of October, 1782. Colonel Ridley also says that he recollects that the attack was made
     on a Sunday night, and during the full of the moon, it being a very bright, beautiful moonlight
     night. Colonel Ridley also states that the original family Bible of Major John Buchanan, after
     his death, went into the possession of his daughter, Mrs. Jane Goodwin, the mother of the
     present keeper of ! be Nashville jail, from whom it can probably be obtained. Colonel Ridley
     also states that some time in August preceding the date ofthe attack, Findleston, ahalf- breed
     Cherokee, and one Joseph Durat, a Frenchman, brought information to Nashville- being, as they
     state, direct from the Indian Nation- that the Indians were preparing an expedition against
     Nashville and the settlements in the neighborhood, and intended to make their attack at the
     next full moon. Findleston had been about Nashville before as a trader, and was acquainted with
     ~ number of the inhabitants; and, in the course of his visits, had conceived an attachment for
     a white woman named, as he thinks, Black. So the story went; but, at all events, he afterward
     married her. He left the Indian Nation, ashe stated, in company with Durat, under pretense of
     acting as a spy, in finding out the situation and strength of the defenses about Nashville, and
     of returning and giving information. Upon the faith of this information, Abraham Castleman (
     more familiarly called Abe Castleman), aman of great daring of much experience in Indian
     warfare and strategy, was sent out as aspy, to discover whether the Indians were approaching.
     He returned, after having gone as far as some place between the Black Fox's camp and Duck
     River, and reported that he had seen the trail of a large body of Indians advancing in the
     direction of Nashville. Ameeting of the heads of families in the settlement was called by
     General Robertson, immediately after the receipt of the above- mentioned information from
     Findleston and Durat; and the meeting was disinclined to believe the story, and dispersed.
     Findleston then offered to General Robertson that he might put him in the Nashville jail, and
     there keep him until after the next full moon, and if the Indians should not have arrived, he
     was willing to be shot The earnestness of Findleston, as thus evinced, was the occasion
     ofAbraham Castleman's being despatched by General Robertson as a spy, as aforesaid. About two
     hundred men, however, were assembled and encamped at Rain's Spring, and the families had
     generally moved in from their residences to stations. &quot; One full moon intervened, and the
     Indians did not arrive. The men FROW CHIPS, Voome 32, Issue No. 4 Page 4 MarchlApril2003 found
     dead; but that, from the quantity of blood that was effused round about, there was much more
     mortality than that. Colonel Ridley presented me with arough draft of the fort at the time and
     the approach to it, which is here present; and says that John McCrory was the man who fired the
     first gun into the midst of a group of Indians gathered together just at the fort- gate from
     the block- house situated nearest the creek; and that Thomas Kennedy fired the next gun into
     the same group from the house situated opposite while under a cross- fire. That the Indians-
     then retreated to an open cellar of an unfinished house, the foundation of which was just
     digged out and walled up, situated outside of the station, and scattered about around the
     station, and took advantage of the localities afforded by the place. In this situation, the two
     contending parties- the men in the station and the Indians without- kept up afiring, and also
     aparley; one asking the other who commanded, and Thomas Kennedy telling them that they were a
     set of damned squaws, and to put more powder in their guns. There were anumber of women in the
     station at the time, and among them Mrs. Sarah Buchanan, who was occupied during the attack in
     carrying around to the men posted in the different parts of the station ammunition and brandy,
     giving to each, as she supplied him, a word of encouragement. In eleven days afterward, this
     same Sarah Buchanan was delivered of her first child, the said George Buchanan. Colonel Ridley
     states that he never heard of Tecumseh's being present at said attack until since the last war
     [ 1812] with England.&quot; [ Ed: This entire artide concerned whether Tecumseh, very famous in
     later years, had been present at the &quot; Attack on Buchanan's Stationl. in camp and the
     families in the stations then began to lose confidence in the truth of the information given by
     Findleston, and also in that of Castleman's report, and they became very anxious to be
     disbanded, and to return to their homes. General Robertson, for the sake of greater caution,
     sent out John Rains and Abraham Kennedy ( commonly called Abe Kennedy) in the direction in
     which Castleman said he had been, for the purpose of seeing what discoveries they could make.
     Rains and Kennedy were gone afew days and returned, and Rains reported that he had seen plenty
     of &quot; bear signs,&quot; but no &quot; Indian signs,&quot; and swore to it, and that he
     believed Castleman was mistaken. Kennedy refused to be sworn, and therefore the men encamped at
     Rain's Spring were discharged. Rains returned, as aforesaid, on Thursday, and the next moming-
     being the Friday next before the attack- the men were discharged. On Sunday morning, the
     inhabitants being still unsatisfied as to whether Findleston's story might not be substantially
     true, sent out from Hardeman's Station, after early breakfast, two spies ( Gee and Clayton)
     upon Taylor's old trace, and they advanced as far as a tract of land then owned by Major
     Buchanan, but now occupied by his son, James B. Buchanan, which is situated on the Jefferson
     Road and extends across to the present Murfreesboro Turnpike Road, and beyond it; and on said
     tract of land, near Neill's Spring, where Beverly Nelson now lives, not far from the old
     Jefferson Road, it being then Taylor's trace, the said spies were met by the advance guard of
     the Indians, and one of them killed on the spot. The other fled, and was likely to make his
     escape, when he was called to by the said advance party of Indians, and told that they were
     friendly, and that his comrade had been killed by the accidental discharge of one of their
     guns. He was thus induced to stop, and when the Indians came up with him, he also was killed.

     “ We want stu-dents in all areas— all majors and all interests. We’re seeking diversity in
     every sense.” The Buchanan Fellows, named for alumnus and Nobel Laureate Dr. James M. Buchanan
     Jr. ( B. S. ’ 40), will con-sist of a special group of honors students selected for
     participa-tion in a six- course cohort cur-riculum to be known as the Buchanan Seminars, said
     Dr. Phil Mathis, dean of the Honors College. Buchanan, a native of See ‘ Honors’ page 5 by
     Randy Weiler Honors College names new seminars for Nobel Laureate Hague Honors from page 1
     Murfreesboro, received the Nobel Prize for Economic Science in 1986 for his development of the
     contractu-al and constitutional bases for the “ public choice” theory of economic and political
     decision- making. “ The courses— six hours in the humanities, eight hours in the natu-ral
     sciences and six hours in the social sciences— have been devel-oped for the Fellows to take as
     a cohort group during their first two years in the Honors College at MTSU,” Mathis said. The
     dean added that each Buchanan Seminar was individually designed by its instructor for the
     Buchanan Fellows Cohort Group, with an emphasis on the epistemo-logical, philosophical and
     interdisci-plinary connections among the vari-ous disciplines. “ Faculty mem-bers involved are
     award- winning teachers and schol-ars who are experi-enced in honors education and plan to
     provide a unique learning experience for these students,” Mathis said. Plans call for 20
     fellows to be chosen annually from a pool of applicants who show high academic promise and who
     meet grade- point average and American College Testing criteria for guaranteed admission,
     Mathis said. In time, the number of Buchanan Fellows is expected to grow to as many as 80.
     Hague said chosen recipients will receive full- tuition scholarships and $ 1,000 per year for
     books. The scholarship will be renewable for up to four years, provided the student maintains
     good academic standing and acceptable progress toward graduation with university honors. “ When
     tuition increases, the scholarship ( for Buchanan Fellows) will, too,” she said, adding that
     the college hopes to offer an incentive for students to study abroad either for a semester or a
     summer. “ The caliber of students enrolled in the Honors College is pretty high, and the
     caliber of student we’re turn-ing out is pretty good,” Mathis said, adding that the average ACT
     for Honors College students is 29— the same as Vanderbilt. Mathis, who proposed the pro-gram,
     also expressed his gratitude to Dr. Bob Glenn, vice president for stu-dent affairs; David
     Hutton, financial aid director; and Dr. Kaylene Gebert, executive vice president and provost,
     for their roles in convincing MTSU President Sidney A. McPhee to pro-vide the resources
     necessary for the program. Mathis</dc:description>

     &quot;Vicksburg&quot; on it, given to my father by one of his men; and his fine watch, which he
     gave to one of his men not so badly wounded and told him to &quot;take it to my wife.&quot;
     Uncle James had returned to his regiment, and mother had gone back to Mississippi, so I spent
     my time on the plantation and at school in Monticello, but I finally went to my aunt's (Mrs.
     Ridley) after I left school. This aunt lived ten miles away and I had to make the trip in an ox
     cart, as all our horses had been taken. A Negro man drove the cart in which I rode with a Negro
     woman and my Saratoga trunk, which contained all of my earthly possessions. My aunt had a young
     daughter, and we three women were the only white people on the hig plantation. While I was
     there, a merchant from Nashville, a kinsman, John B. Everett, stopped over on his way to Macon,
     Ga., and to him I gave a hundred dollars with which to huy me ten yards of calico and another
     hundred for a pair of store shoes. He got them for me, and I felt. very well-fixed indeed with
     my new calico and a silk dress that my mother had left me when she went hack to
     Mississippi,also a green plaid delaine made from an old dress of my aunt's. All these had been
     made up for Christmas, which was not far off, and hung away in the closet upstairs. After
     Stoneman left that section there was a great deal of suffering, and all the mills and factories
     had heen burned and the poor people were out of work. One night, two boys, about ten and twelve
     years old, came to my aunt's asking for something to eat and a place to sleep. We took them in
     and put them upstairs to sleep. We thought nothing of their leaving so early the next morning,
     but in a about a week, when I went upstairs to look at my dresses, I found them gone. You can
     imagine how heartsick I was over having my pretty frocks stolen. Aunt and I would talk often
     about the war and what we had to eat. Our coffee was made of parched meal, dried sweet
     potatoes, peanuts, okra, and such things; our sweetening was sugar cane and molasses; our drink
     was a persimmon beer, made. in a tub. Our main thought was, when will this cruel war he over?
     It was soon to end. Many of the soldiers from Tennessee came to Forsyth, for there was a large
     Ridley family living around there, and they took care of all the kin and friends until . they
     were able to get money from Tennessee to go home on. Old Dr. Charles Ridley and his wife, a
     remarkable woman, had been pioneers in that section, and their three sons had married and lived
     near them. They were all kindness itself in giving what they had to the stranded soldiers. Many
     of these soldiers had been paroled in that section, and among them were Gen. A. P. Stewart and
     his two sons; Judge Bromfield Ridley, his two sons and a daughter, who marri.ed later on and
     was the mother of Admiral Ridley McLean, of the present U. S. Navy, and there was Capt. James
     Ridley. Mter conditions had improved, my uncle, Mr. Camillus Huggins, came down to Ga. to get
     the four thousand dollars in gold which we had been keeping for him (burying it for safety),
     and he took me back to Tennessee to my people, who supplied me with everything I needed. When
     we left Mississippi, there were five hundred bales of cotton on the plantation, hut when uncle
     went back after the war, only five hales could he found. Mter going hack to Mississippi from
     Georgia, my mother had her beautiful china and our family silverware buried, and I thought the
     silverware had he~n stolen, as I never saw it again; hut I learned some years ago that in
     settling up my father's estate after the war everything had been sold, and a cousin had bought
     the silver. So that was one time the Yankees missed a trick. written 1929 by Margaret Ridley

     Chandler]&quot;MAJOR JOHN BUCHANAN was born at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, January 12, 1759, and
     was the oldest son of James and Jane Trimble Buchanan (of Scotch Irish descent). He was a brave
     old man with a liberal, generous disposition, endowed with the faculty of precaution and
     prudence, a well balanced mind, of sound judgment, a noble soul and a spirit of keen
     susceptibility, having accompanied his father through all his meanderings over mountain and
     vale, sharing with him in all his trials, labors, dangers, and hardships incident to the first
     settlers ofthe middle states of America, greatly qualified him as a leader, protector and
     benefactor. The father, through age and infIrmity caused by trial, exposure and hardship that
     the pioneers of the American continent had to undergo, became unable to maintain and defend his
     family. This duty devolved upon the son, he being the moving spirit and nucleus around which
     the hope of future support protection and happiness of the mother and sisters clung. He
     necessarily assumed the care and responsibility ofthe family. The spirit of adventure so
     inherent in the father had its potent influence on the 80n. The wonderful accounts made of him
     through exploring, enterprising settlers of the beauties and fertility of the Cumberland Valley
     country, with its abundance of wild game that nature had seemingly turned loose to graze upon
     the luxuriant cane brakes and tangled pea vine that grew so profusely throughout this beautiful
     country; his ambitious spirit and love for adventure could be held in subjection no longer..
     MAJOR JOHN BUCHANAN, with his father's family, left Danville, Kentucky, for the Cumberland
     country with the fond hope of finding a permanent home. They arrived where Nashville is now
     located December 14, 1778, and crossed the Cumberland River on the ice at the mouth of Sulphur
     Spring branch. On his arrival he found General James Robertson and one other man living in log
     cabins on the bluff of the Cumberland River where the county jail now stands. The third house
     erected was built by Buchanan andd his comrades. These pioneers, as a means ofbetter protection
     and defense against the attacks ofthe various bands ofIndians frequently maraudingthe
     settlement, built a fort on the bluff over the Cumberland River on what is now Front Street,
     near to where the county prison stands. In 1781 the Indians invaded the settlement and
     Alexander Buchanan, brother of Major John Buchanan, was killed by the Indians near the crossing
     of Market and Broad streets. After staying at the Nashville fort four years, MAJOR BUCHANAN
     moved six miles east of the Nashville fort and erected his rude cabin on astream now called
     Mill Creek from the fact that he afterward built the first mill that was ever erected in the
     county on it. As a necessity, he soon built a fort in simplicity of style but formidable in
     strength to guard against the attacks of the Indians in their savage mode ofwarfare in the time
     ofthe early settlers ofTennessee. On the night of September 30, 1792 the combined force of
     three tribes of Indians, numbering 900 warriors, made an attack upon Buchanan station thinking
     from the simplicity of its structure and weakness of its defense to over-ride that &quot;cow
     pen fort&quot; so styled by the Indians. With true gallantry these brave men, like Spartans,
     stood to their posts, and with unerring aim with their flint rock rifles held the fort and
     defeated the enemy with the slight wounding of one man in the fort. One Indian chief was
     killed, and left near the fort, in the act of setting the fort on fire. From the blood and
     other signs· left by the Indians there were many others killed or wounded. In the heat of the
     hattIe, the ammunition in the fort began to get scarce and Nancy Mulheron, sister of Major
     Buchanan, melted the pewter plates and dishes used by the early settlers and moulded them into
     bullets, and carried them while hot in her apron around to the men fighting. The men engaged in
     this battle were: Major John Buchanan., James Bryant, Thomas Wilcox, James O'Conner, Robin
     Castleman, James Mulheron, Thomas McCrary, Morris Shane, William Kennedy, Samuel Blair, Robin
     Kennedy, Thomas Durat, George Finalson, Charles Herd, Sampson Williams, John Castleman, Samuel
     McMurray, Robin Turnbull, Thomas Latimer, Robin Hood, and James Thompson, JAMES BUCHANAN,
     father of this branch of the Buchanan family in Tennessee, was killed by an Indian in his cahin
     near the fort two or three months before the battle of September 30, 1792. Children of Maj.

     AWARD The President's Award at Middle Tennessee State University provides special recognition
     to individuals or organizations who have distinguished themselves through their exemplary
     service to MTSU; their extraordinary contributions to education, the community, or society; or
     their remarkable professional achievement. Asilver medallion, designed by Chris Brady and
     crafted by Klaus Kallenberger, with the phrase semper aspirare (always aspire) is presented as
     tangible evidence of this recognition. Today, Nobel laureate James M. Buchanan returns to his
     alma mater to become the third recipient of this award. MTSU proudly salutes this outstanding
     individual! 2 COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER Dr. James M. Buchanan, Nobel laureate Dr. James M. Buchanan,
     (B.S. '40), who grew up in rural middle Tennessee­the Gum community in Rutherford County.
     Despite his obvious brilliance and prodigious achievements, he seems never to have lost his
     independent spirit and the simple goodness of his roots. Buchanan the farm boy, the scholar,
     the man...ar.e still one and the same. He attended Buchanan School, so named because it was
     built on land once part of the Buchanan family farm. He came from a poor but distinguished
     family. His grandfather, John P. Buchanan, was elected governor of Tennessee in 1891. It was,
     however, his family's poverty, Dr. Buchanan has said, that provided him a strong family
     foundation and created a sense of determination, purpose, and frugality. Early on, it was
     determined that the young Buchanan would follow in his grandfather's steps and become a
     lawyer-politician. When the Great Depression put Vanderbilt University out of reach
     financially, he decided he could live at home, earn money for books and fees by milking cows,
     and attend the small college down the road. Dr. Buchanan studied at Middle Tennessee State
     Teachers College from 1936 to 1940. He graduated with majors in mathematics, English
     literature, and social, science. later that year, he was awarded a graduate fellowship in
     economics at UT­Knoxville and earned his master's degree in 194 I. He then won a fellowship in
     statistics at Columbia University for the 1941-42 academic year. However, military service
     intervened, and he was in the U.S. Navy by August 1941. After officer training and duty at
     Pearl Harbor and Guam, he was discharged in 1945. He went to the University of Chicago in 1946
     and left with a Ph.D. degree in 1948. He received a Fulbright grant for the 1955-56 year and
     studied in Italy. In his book Better Than Plowing and Other Personal Essays (I 992, University
     of Chicago Press), he said of his undergraduate years, &quot;Up until about my second year, I
     was not really sure about my own competence or ability. At the end of that year, however, the
     academic rankings were published, and, with all As that year, my name led all the rest. This
     result made me forget all about the first year C that Nooby Freeman had given me in mechanical
     drawing, the only C that I got during the whole of my academic career.&quot; cont. on next page
     3 When Dr. Buchanan visited MTSU in 1997 to address the first Buchanan Scholars, he summed up
     his personal journey by sbaring words of advice. &quot;I would emphasize the fact that students
     from Middle Tennessee can make it. In other words, they shouldn't stand in awe of the eastern
     establishment elite.&quot; &quot;The mixed curriculum, bbth self-selected and imposed, served
     me well,&quot; Dr. Buchanan wrote of his college experience. &quot;Economics, the discipline
     that was to become my scientific home, requires expository writing skills, logical structures
     of analysis, and a grounding in ultimate reality. And political economy, the branch of moral
     philosophy from which economics springs, requires philosophical coherence. I came away from
     Middle Tennessee with all of these... &quot; In 1986, Dr. Buchanan was awarded the Nobel
     Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, of which he wrote, &quot;If Jim Buchanan can get a Nobel
     Prize, anyone can. Recognition and acceptance of this simple truth are very importanL.Here was
     Jim Buchanan, a country boy from middle Tennessee, educated in rural public schools . and a
     local public teachers college, who is with an establishment university. who has never shared
     the academically fashionable soft left ideology, who has worked in totally unorthodox subject
     matter with very old-fashioned tools of analysis, chosen by a distinguished and respected
     Swedish committee.&quot; By describing Frank Knight. who was his mentor at the University of
     Chicago. Dr. Buchanan reveals who he is. &quot;The qualities of mind that Knight exhibited
     were, and remain, those that I seek to emulate: the willingness to question anything. and
     anybody, on any subject anytime; the categorical refusal to accept anything as sacred; the
     genuine openness to all ideas; and finally, the basic conviction that most ideas peddled about
     are nonsense or worse when examined critically.&quot; Today, Dr. Buchanan, the author of
     several books and essays. serves as advisory general director of the Center for Study of Public
     Choice at George Mason University. in Fairfax, Virginia. Since 1911 Middle Tennessee State
     University has graduated 75,293 students since its incep­tion in I9 I I. These students have
     received associate, bachelor, masters, educational specialist. and doctoral degrees. Our first
     doctoral degrees were conferred on Decem­ber 22, 1972, and the first educational specialist
     degrees on December 20, 1974. There have been 31 Idoctoral degrees and 870 educational
     specialist degrees awarded since that time. 4</dc:description>
