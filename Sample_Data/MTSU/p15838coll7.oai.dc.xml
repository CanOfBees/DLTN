Stone belt courses define the floor levels, and the building has two entrance doors, each of which has a three-paned window with arched lintel centered above it on the second level, and another centered above that window on the third level. Brickwork detailing includes six projecting bracket forms across the top of building.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Warfield Lodge No. 44, F. &amp; A.M. (P.H.A.) dates to the 1890s, when the Tennessee Grand Lodge issued the charter for the group.  The lodge purchased a lot in Clarksville at the corner of Ninth and Main Streets in 1899, and by 1901 owned the property.  The first lodge hall burned in 1911, and was rebuilt/remodeled in 1912.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Street cleaning</dc:subject>
<dc:coverage>United States -- Tennessee -- Chattanooga</dc:coverage>
<dc:description>Two African American males, in billed caps and boots, sweeping litter onto a shovel in front of a metal trash bin on wheels. The man at left, who wears some type of work coverall, appears to be smoking a pipe, while the man right wears a worn sweater with a hole at shoulder. A car parked at the curb around the corner is partially visible and a placard on the building behind the men reads &quot;Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>These two street cleaners appear in a downtown setting, in front of a building with a clean stone facade and modern concrete sidewalk with stone curbing, at a time when it appears to be somewhat chilly and when no other persons were at the scene--possibly early morning. Although this is a public setting, work hours for African American menial laborers may have been restricted so they were virtually invisible to many of those who worked in this district.</dc:description>

</dc:description>
<dc:description>Miller was a former slave who moved to Chattanooga from Georgia in October 1864. He worked as a pressman on several newspapers before starting his own paper, the Weekly Blade  in 1898.  The Blade ran for twelve years, and Miller became known for his condemnation of segregation. In 1905, Miller was one of the organizers in Chattanooga of the streetcar system in protest of a 1905 state law that segregated streetcar passengers.  He started his own taxi service in 1905, the Hack Line, that ran between Chattanooga and outlying African American communities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Thomas W. Talley, who chaired the Chemistry Department at Fisk University for 25 years, was also a singer and a musician. In 1922, he published Negro Folk Rhymes, based on the stories, rhymes, and songs he learned in his youth, with his own scholarly analysis and an introduction by Vanderbilt literature professor Walter Clyde Curry. According to scholar Lucinda Poole Cockrell, Talley's volume was &quot;the first serious collection of folksongs from Tennessee . . . and the first to be assembled by a black scholar.&quot; &lt;http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1683&gt;

Another man, who is also wearing a dark suit and white shirt like the others, stands next to the corner of addition. The laundry on the line suggests that the cabin is still inhabited.</dc:description>
<dc:description>James Carroll Napier was born on the western outskirts of Nashville in 1845. His parents, who were slaves at the time of his birth, were freed three years later. They sent James and his siblings to the school of Daniel Wadkins, a free black teacher whose students numbered as many as sixty.  When a white backlash against free blacks caused the closure of the school, Napier's parents sent  him to Ohio to complete his education. After graduating from Howard Law School in Washington, D.C. Napier returned to Nashville, became involved in Republican politics, and practiced law. He was elected to the City Council in 1878, was one of the founders of the National Negro Business League, and served as the appointed Register of the United States Treasury from 1911-1913.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Album cover for reissue of Josh White recordings in 1940 and 19411.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The liner notes for this compilation of recordings, written by Dave Moore, indicate that Josh White's performances during this period, with both black and white performers of the day, including Billie Holiday and Pete Seeger, ranged from gospel to mainstream blues. They also earned him notoriety by combining familiar traditional melodies with protests against inequality for African Americans. White became so well-known that he was invited to perform for President and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also brought before Senator Joseph McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee, but managed to emerge from that encounter unscathed and continued to perform into the 1950s and 1960s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Scan of cover of Zip Coon: A Popular Negro Song.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The song “Zip Coon” was originally performed by George Washington Dixon in 1834 as a caricature of free, urban African American. He was portrayed as a well-dressed dandy who &quot;put on airs&quot; and pretended to be above his station.   White audiences, confident in their social (and racial) superiority, were entertained by Zip Coon's misplaced attempts to seem clever, educated, and sophisticated. The tune used for the song will be familiar to contemporary listeners as &quot;Turkey in the Straw.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>The first CME (Christian Methodist Episcopal, formerly Colored Methodist Episcopal) was Capers Memorial CME Church in Nashville, organized in 1866.   In 1870, leaders from Capers and other African American Methodists in West Tennessee broke away from the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and created a new denomination, the CME church.   The CME church was especially popular in West Tennessee, and was headquartered in Jackson, Tennessee until 1970, when the headquarters moved to Memphis.  The CME Church has more than a million members.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although it had several early locations, possibly also including a church, before the construction of its own building on 9th Street, historian Rita Lorraine Hubbard [African American of Chattanooga: A History of Unsung Heroes, 2007] believes that Howard School may originally have been housed in a former federal hospital barracks on Chestnut Street. It was founded as a &quot;free&quot; school for African Americans circa 1865, and named for General O.O. Howard, a commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau. By 1872, it had become the first public school (for either white or African American children) in Chattanooga. Professor James Henry, shown in this photograph, was the first African American principal of the school. A native of Buffalo, New York, he graduated from Atlanta University in 1883, came to Chattanooga to teach at Howard in 1884, and was present at the school's first graduation in 1886.   He is surrounded in the photograph by members of the graduating class.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Valaida Snow was a blues singer and musician, and was known as the &quot;Queen of the Trumpet&quot; for her ability on that instrument.  She became a professional musician by the age of 15, and spent much of the 1920s touring the United States with various musical reviews.  She appeared in some feature films in the late 1930s, and toured Europe in 1939.  While performing in Denmark, she was arrested by Nazis and may have spent nearly two years in a concentration camp (Wester-Faengler).  After her release in a prisoner exchange, Snow returned to New York City and tried to regain fame as a musician.  She died in 1956.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stamped with the Great Seal of Tennessee on certificate bearing the legend &quot;State of Tennessee&quot; with an engraving of the Tennessee State Capitol at top center, this document, dated 25 April 1868, appoints J.C. Napier as County Claim Commissioner for Davidson County.
</dc:description>
<dc:description>James C. Napier was born to free parents in Nashville in 1845. Young James attended a free black school in Nashville until the disruption caused by the Civil War. With the children of several other free black families, he went to Ohio to continue his education.
On his return to Nashville, he heard an Emancipation Day speech by John Mercer Langston, a prominent Ohio free black and a friend of Napier's father, who visited Nashville on December 30, 1864. The young Napier became involved in local Republican politics, as this certificate of appointment to a post in the Reconstruction administration of  Tennessee's Republican Governor, William Gannaway Brownlow, attests. At Langston's invitation, Napier left Nashville a year or so later to attend Howard Law School in Washington, D.C., from which he graduated in 1872.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Handbill for an integrated performance in 1942 in Eureka, Alabama.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Billed as &quot;first time in history that white and colored render a joint program,&quot; handbill advertises  an event at Eureka School, in Eureka, Alabama in 1942. The performers were the Daniel Quartet, a white gospel group featured on the Grand Ole Opry, and the Fairfield Four, an African American gospel group from Nashville. Sharing the bill, apparently, was boxer Joe Louis's mother. According to the Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music John Daniel (1903-1961), the leader of the quartet, was from the Sand Mountain area of Alabama. He moved the singing group to Nashville in the 1940s, which allowed broadcasts over WLAC and WSM radio. Joining John Daniel and his brother Troy over the years were a number of aspiring young singers, including Gordon Stoker (1924-2013), who joined the group as a pianist right out of high school. Stoker is best-known as a member of The Jordanaires, for whom he played piano beginning in 1950, assuming the role of first tenor in 1953 and continuing with the group until his retirement in 2000.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sitka School was an African American school in rural Gibson County.  It was built in 1942 by the community as a two-room frame building and had electrical wiring.  The school was set on acres of land, and the community also donated a playground for the school.  It is typical of the types of rural schools available to African Americans in Tennessee during this time period.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two-story brick building with triple stone arched entry, steep pitched roof with two front gable dormers, side gable dormer also visible on left side, and center steeple with gothic cupola. A low stone wall marks the boundary of the property and utility poles and wires are visible in front of the building. Photograph shows small bare trees out front, and a low modern-looking horizontal structure behind, with a square brick smokestack behind it.  Written at lower left on the photograph &quot;Main Street Colored School&quot; and at lower right &quot;Stokes.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>Originally named Montgomery Avenue School, this photograph shows what became known as the Main Street School after Montgomery Avenue became Main Street.  In 1881, this public school, originally housed in a church building, became the first in Chattanooga to have an African American teacher assigned to teach African American students. The circa 1890s building shown here was built to accomodate Chattanooga's growing African American population, as were East Fifth Street  and East Eighth Street Schools.  </dc:description>

<dc:description>Matt Gardner was born into slavery in 1847, and freed in 1865.  A frugal man, Mr. Gardner saved his money until he was able to purchase a 300 acre farm on the Elk River in Giles County.  In addition to his farm, he served as a pastor for two separate Baptist churches in the community, funded the community-built school, and led fundraising efforts in 1926 to build a Rosenwald School in his community.  Mr. Gardner lived until the age of 95, a respected leader in his community.  His homestead is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the site is also home of the Matt Gardner Homestead Museum that interprets African American life. The house
pictured here was built as a two-story saddlebag house in 1896.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Matt Gardner was born into slavery in 1847 in Alabama, and sold to Richard C. Gardner, a Nashville merchant and plantation owner in Elkton, Tennessee, in 1862.   In 1877, he married Henrietta Jenkins. In the late 1880s, Matt Gardner financed and helped to build the first school for African Americans in Elkton, as well as providing room and board at his farm for the teacher.  In addition to farming, Matt Gardner traveled around Giles County, Tennessee and Limestone County, Alabama, preaching at different churches on alternating Sundays.  Henrietta and Matt were the parents of eleven children. Henrietta died on July 23, 1940.  When Matt Gardner died June 5, 1943, more than 1,000 people attended his funeral.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This photograph is one of at least sixteen images of African American businesses and homes in Nashville (several additional images of Fisk University and Roger Williams University students can be accessed here: http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/) that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. 220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there.</dc:description>

<dc:description>First Baptist Church, located at 379 Beale Street in Memphis, has been a part of Memphis's African American community since the congregation first erected a frame building on Beale Street in 1864.  Beginning in 1866, the congregation began building this building, completing it in c. 1880.  Former president Ulysses Grant visited the church in 1880.  It is considered to be the first brick-constructed, multi-story church built by African Americans in the United States. After a fire in 1925, the interior was rebuilt, and the exterior was painted white in c. 1964.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Bottoms was located near the south-west section of downtown Murfreesboro, and developed as a blue-collar neighborhood during Reconstruction. Although some whites lived in the area, it was largely an African American neighborhood. The area often flooded due to its proximity to Lytle Creek.</dc:description>

This served as a school until the 1950s.  It is the last one-room school house in the region.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This photograph of W.L. Smith's grocery store is one of at least four of African American businesses and homes in Knoxville that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway for display at the Paris Exposition of 1900. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. The Library of Congress holds 220 of the photographs, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken the</dc:description>

<dc:description>This image shows a crowd in the Memphis terminal, September 1943, during a Greyhound bus trip from Louisville, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. It was taken by Esther Bubley (1921-1998), a young photographer who had been hired by Roy Stryker, formerly at the Farm Security Administration, who had just been appointed to direct photography for the Office of War Information. Bubley spent four weeks riding buses on a route that include Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Chicago, Columbus, Cincinnati, Louisville, Memphis, Nashville and Chattanooga before heading back to Washington. One of the reasons for the series was to document the increase in bus travel due to wartime rationing of gasoline and tires.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Black and white image of a smiling young African American soldier in uniform seated in a wooden lawn chair below a raised wooden porch and the corner of a frame house holds two tiny children in white dresses, with a seated boy about two years of age wearing shorts and holding a bottle leaning against the chair at his feet.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Reverend Lonzie Odie Taylor (circa 1899-1977) was pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Memphis in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. He was also a photographer who recorded the daily life of the community in which he lived. This informal family portrait of a smiling young soldier in uniform, seated in a lawn chair with three young children, in  a neatly kept, middle class neighborhood with established trees and vegetation, has a friendly informality that suggests not only a moment of tranquility, stability, and prosperity, but also that the photographer was known and liked by the subject.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Reverend Lonzie Odie Taylor (circa 1899-1977) was pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Memphis in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. He was also a photographer who recorded the daily life of the community in which he lived. Posed studio shots, such as this one, give evidence that his photographic output was of value to his subjects. Historically, soldiers in uniform have had portraits made for the purpose of recording patriotic service or creating  a keepsake image for loved ones. Photographs might also be commissioned to record a military promotion or commendation. In this case, the soldier is wearing a medal, which indicates that he has performed meritorious service and possibly seen combat.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This photograph, which was captioned, for purposes of display at the Paris Exposition of 1900, as &quot;Home of Mr. Manning, Knoxville, Tenn.&quot; is one of at least four of African American businesses and homes in Knoxville that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. The Library of Congress holds 220 of these photographs, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there. </dc:description>

<dc:description>C.C. Dodson was a Knoxville jeweller who had a shop in the Vine Avenue business district. A photograph of his home and family appears to have been taken at the same time as this and at least two other photographs of successful African Americans living in Knoxville at the turn of the twentieth century. This is one of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway for display at the Paris Exposition of 1900. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans.

<dc:description>The Zinc Company Baseball League, from Jefferson City, Tennessee, played in the old Negro League. According to the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History &amp; Culture &lt;http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net&gt;,the first zinc mining in Tennessee occurred at Mossy Creek, near Jefferson City, in 1854. After the early surface mines were exhausted, the zinc industry developed large underground operations in Knox, Jefferson, Hawkins, Hancock, and Grainger Counties. The industry was one of the highest producers nationally in the 1960s, and its modern production depends on a small number of large operators around Mascot, in the Jefferson City area. The American Zinc Company came to Mascot in 1915. The East Tennessee Zinc Company is still producing in Jefferson City.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aaron Douglas, born in Topeka, Kansas, in 1898, was one of the leading visual artists of the Harlem Renaissance. He was commissioned in 1930 to paint a series of murals in Cravath Hall at Fisk University. These murals depict African American contributions to American history and society. He returned to Fisk University as a professor in the late 1930s and founded the Art Department. Douglas died in Nashville in 1979.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Knoxville College established a medical school in 1895 to train physicians and also to provide medical care for African Americans. The school struggled with inadequate staffing and facilities and closed in 1900 after graduating only two students: N.B. Crenshaw and J.G. King. Recognizing the ongoing need for professional medical education, Dr. Henry Morgan Green, a graduate of Knoxville College with a degree from Northwestern University, was one of the founders of the Knoxville Medical College that same year. In its ten years of operation, the school prepared twenty-one doctors for the profession. However the need for a hospital continued--the Knoxville General Hospital opened in 1902 provided only two basement wards for African Americans and prohibited black physicians from attending patients. Eliza B. Wallace left money to Knoxville College to build a hospital on the campus as a facility to train nurses. The modern two-story building that opened in 1907 was built by Knoxville College students and constructed using student-made bricks. The wing for contagious diseases was added in 1915. Not only did it provide a well-equipped training facility for nurses, the hospital attracted more African American physicians to Knoxville. When the hospital closed in 1926, there were twenty black doctors in Knoxville.</dc:description>

The modern facility filled a need in the community for professional nursing instruction, provided medical care to Knoxville College students, and was open to outside patients. Private physicians were able to practice there as well, which helped make Knoxville a center for African American health care in the early decades of the twentieth century.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Advertisement for a summer resort for African Americans in Shelbyville.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This ad, published in the Nashville Globe on April 2, 1909, is for a summer resort taking place in Shelbyville, Tennessee.  During segregation, travel was as segregated as the rest of society.  This ad claims that the only resort for African Americans in the state would be open on the grounds of Turner Normal School in Shelbyville. Turner Normal College was established by the AME Church in Shelbyville in 1886 as a high school and relocated to Memphis in 1935.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mt. Zion AME Church in Centerville, Tennessee is a good example of the small, historic African American churches that still dot the rural landscape in Tennessee.  The church has been a vibrant part of the community, hosting both religious services and allowing African American fraternal groups to use the building. In the 1880s, the church started a high school for African Americans. Classes met at the church, and the school was known as the Centreville Male and Female Academy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mt. Olivet Cemetery, an African American cemetery, was established in Jackson in 1885. The establishment of this cemetery in 1885 shows the move towards Jim Crow segregation following Reconstruction in Tennessee, as the divisions between the races became more marked as the 19th century waned. More than 1600 people are buried in this cemetery.  This marker for F.E. Grimes is one of several handmade markers found in this cemetery.  </dc:description>

<dc:description>The congregation of St. Mark's Presbyterian Church in Rogersville was established circa 1875. The church was closely associated with Swift Memorial Junior College, founded in 1883 by The Reverend Dr. William H. Franklin. The property for the church was purchased circa 1885 by the Board of Missions for Freedmen to add to the campus.  Reverend Franklin, who was also pastor of St. Mark's Presbyterian, was a native of Knoxville and the first African American graduate of Maryville College. This building was erected circa 1912, the same year that St. Mark's Presbyterian received its charter from the State of Tennessee. It stands today, at the corner of Kyle and N. Hasson Streets, just one block north of West Main Street in downtown Rogersville. The congregation disbanded in 2002.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Free Hill Rosenwald School was built c. 1929-1930 with assistance from the Julius Rosenwald Foundation. The only Rosenwald school built in Clay County, it operated as a school until 1966. It currently serves as a community center.  The community of Free Hill is located five miles northeast of Celina, Tennessee, and was organized by former slaves.  Virginia Hill, a slaveholder originally from North Carolina, freed her slaves and gave them 2,000 acres of land.  The former slaves named their community Free Hill.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Beginning in 1912, the Rosenwald Fund contributed matching funds for the construction of thousands of schools for African Americans across the South. Built in 1925, the Lincoln School is an excellent example of the standardized architecture of the schools that were specified in the Community School Plans. The Rosenwald Fund provided $900 for the construction of the Lincoln School, Pikeville's African American community provided $1,200, Bledsoe County and the State of Tennessee provided $3236 for its construction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Golden Hill Cemetery in Clarksville dates to 1863, and may be the oldest tract of land continuously owned by African Americans in Clarksville. Stephen Cole, a former slave, purchased the land in 1863, and the cemetery was formally incorporated in 1882.  A number of veterans are buried at Golden Hill, including Stephen Cole's son, Edward.  Part of the significance of this site is that it is associated with the establishment of a distinct African American community in Clarksville.</dc:description>

<dc:description>World War I hero Alvin Cullum York founded the York Institute in 1926. He went on speaking tours to raise funds to provide the education he had never had, growing up in rural Fentress County, Tennessee, for the boys and girls of coming generations. The school was transferred to the state of Tennessee in 1937. The future of the York Institute was in peril for several years until a successful fund-raising campaign and the efforts of historians and preservationists made it possible to restore the building to use. Today it serves as a public K-12 school in the region.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inside front cover and introductory page of the 1937 souvenir program for the Cotton Makers Jubilee. The inside cover contains two advertisements: the top 1/4 page was taken by A. Schwab, 163 Beale, &quot;better goods at better prices&quot; and the lower 3/4 page by Mid-South Refrigerator &amp; Appliance Co. 206 Hernando Street, billing itself as &quot;Memphis' Only Colored Appliance Store.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>The introduction to the 1937 program recounts the history of the Cotton Makers Jubilee, which was founded by Dr. R.Q. Venson as the &quot;Cotton-Makers Fiesta&quot; in 1936, featuring a parade, a play about African American accomplishments, and a grand ball at which W.C. Handy performed as guest of honor. The name was changed to Cotton Makers Jubilee in 1937, and it became the African American counterpart to Memphis's Cotton Carnival. The objective of the &quot;Memphis Cotton-Makers (sic) Jubilee as set out here&quot; is to symbolize the great and important part which the colored people of this area have played in the history of cotton . . . it marks one of the first times in the history of this area . . . that colored and white Memphians and Delta citizens have been united in a common program for the advancement and development of their common home community--the Deep South--the cotton belt.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>This black and white photograph shows a Victorian, cross-gable, two-story frame house with fancy Craftsman detailed pediments in double front gables, fancy lightning rods atop all visible gable peaks, and a brick chimney.  The house is approached by terraced steps and a central sidewalk leading to the front door inside an enclosed porch. There are two trees on either side of the sidewalk, and a neat lawn surrounded by a low iron fence around the lot. A utility pole and wires are visible in front of the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This photograph, which was captioned, for purposes of display at the Paris Exposition of 1900, as &quot;Negro Homes--home of R.R. Church, Memphis, Tenn. (exterior)&quot; is one of at least twenty-four of African American businesses and homes in Tennessee that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. Robert Reed Church and his son Robert Reed Church, Jr., were two of Memphis's most prominent African American citizens. Church built a park and auditorium for on six acres of land on Beale Street in 1899. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans.  220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Tennessee: Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1). The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there. http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/</dc:description>

<dc:description>A black hearse drawn by two white horses stands facing a single white horse harnessed to a black open-top buggy whose driver wears a bowler hat, in front of a frame building with G.W. Franklin, Undertaker. painted on its side. There is another horse-drawn hearse standing behind the one at center of the image, and an electric pole visible at left. A canvas awning appears to have been drawn up above the door of the business.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Born in Georgia, G.W. Franklin moved his funeral business to Chattanooga in 1894, and was the first African American funeral director and embalmer in Chattanooga. Franklin was a friend of Booker T. Washington and a member of the National Negro Business League. The funeral home remains in business, and is operated and owned by Franklin's descendants. Another image of G.W. Franklin's funeral home was included in the Paris Exposition of 1900, as part of an exhibit organized by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. </dc:description>

<dc:description>This is the first year of the Cotton Makers Jubilee, which had evolved from the &quot;Colored Jubilee Committee&quot; in 1935, to the &quot;Cotton-Makers Fiesta&quot; in 1936, before it was officially named the Cotton Makers Jubilee in 1937. It was the African American version of Memphis's Cotton Carnival. The two festivals were concurrent and in later years some of the ceremonial events featured their honorary kings and queens appearing together.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Letter dated March 25, 1910 on letterhead of the Rockefeller Fund of the General Education Board, 2 Rector Street, New York.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dr. Philander P. Claxton served as the High School Inspector, Department of Education, at the University of Tennessee during the early decades of the twentieth century. This letter, from Wallace Buttrick, Secretary, was part of a general fact-finding initiative to determine the status of secondary education for African Americans in the southern states. It apparently included a questionnaire and Claxton collected information regarding public, tax-supported high schools for negroes in Tennessee. His report contained the following facts about schools in Tennessee's six largest cities: Kortrecht High, Memphis, six teachers, 42 boys, 96 girls building valued at $10,000;
Chattanooga  Howard High School,  2-3 teachers, 16 boys, 46 girls $30,000 building; 
Clarksville Tenth Street Colored School, 1 teacher, 20 boys, 36 girls;
Jackson, South Jackson School,  2-4 teachers, 11 boys, 36 girls  $5150 building;

<dc:description>Future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall came to Tennessee and headed the defense of the African Americans charged in connection with the Columbia Race Riot. He was assisted in his efforts by Z. Alexander Looby of Nashville and Maurice Weaver of Chattanooga. Marshall and his team were successful in having the judge move the trial from Columbia to Lawrenceburg, and the jury there acquitted 23 of the men and found two of the men guilty on October 4, 1946. On November 18, 1946, one of the two found guilty was acquitted; the other man received a commuted sentence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>On August 1, 1946, a group of veterans in Athens took up arms to stop a local group, led by State Senator Paul Cantrell and linked to Memphis mayor Edward Crump from stealing the election. The veterans broke into the courthouse and demanded the return of the ballot boxes. The deputies refused and the veterans opened fire. This &quot;Battle of Athens&quot; lasted several hours and only ended after the front of the jail was dynamited. The mob also turned cars over on the Square and burned them, as seen in this picture. The Battle of Athens was a victory for the veterans as the Election Commission swore in the veteran candidates as duly elected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Photograph of several young men arrested for their part in the &quot;Battle of Athens&quot; on August 1, 1946.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Local politics in Athens, Tennessee was controlled in 1946 by the Cantrell-Mansfield ring. Former sheriff Paul Cantrell and current McMinn County sheriff Pat Mansfield led a corrupt ring that colluded with bootleggers, engaged in election chicanery, and &quot;shook down&quot; tourists and local residents for fees. In the August 1946 elections, World War II veterans supported the candidacy of one of their fellow veterans, Knox Henry, to push reform efforts. Sheriff Mansfield and his deputies physically intimidated several of the GIs, as well as an African American man attempting to vote, locking the ballot boxes inside the jail. This triggered the &quot;Battle of Athens,&quot; in which veterans took weapons from the armory and fired on the deputies. After a day of violence, the ballot boxes were surrendered by deputies inside the jail. This event exemplifies veteran activism in local communities following World War II. The Columbia Race Riot, in February 1946, which ended in several deaths and widespread destruction in the African American business district in Columbia, Tennessee, was also prompted by a returning serviceman demanding fair treatment and the creation of a new social order in Tennessee. </dc:description>

This modern laboratory, providing instruction in chemistry for students of the 1940s, may have been under the auspices of the University of Tennessee's faculty, per the continuing agreement to provide state-funded equal educational opportunity on separate campuses for African American Tennesseans. It was likely housed in the Mechanical and Industrial Building, or in the Agriculture Building, both of which were brick structures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>&quot;Big Detail&quot; advertisement, inviting &quot;colored people only&quot; to the Ryman Auditorium, July 4, 1910, to hear &quot;the best caller in Nashville&quot; on the Johnson-Jeffries Prize Fight.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The match between Jack Johnson, an African American, and James Jeffries, a white former heavyweight boxing champion, was hailed as &quot;The Fight of the Century.&quot; Johnson, to the surprise of the white media, won the match handily. The advertisement is for an event the day of the fight at the Ryman Auditorium. It shows that the Ryman Auditorium was used by African Americans for a number of events during the period of segregation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>First Baptist Church, Lauderdale, is considered one of the most significant African American churches in Memphis and in West Tennessee.  The congregation was begun in 1854 by Morris Henderson.  This congregation built the First Baptist Beale church building.   The congregation split in 1894, and the First Colored Baptist Church, as it was known, moved out of their church building on Beale Street to Zion Hall, also located on Beale Street.  In 1906, the congregation moved to a site on St. Paul Avenue.  In the 1930s, the area was condemned and the neighborhood demolished.  At that time, the congregation moved to South Lauderdale Street, building the church building depicted here.  The church enjoyed a long association with Booker T. Washington High School, an African American high school located across the street. This congregation is considered the &quot;mother church&quot; for many of the African American Baptist congregations in Memphis and West Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although the current building for the Fredonia Baptist Church dates to 1957, this congregation dates to 1867, and has been an active church since its inception.  Two Baptist ministers, Reverend Hardin Smith and Reverend Henry Owen, officially began this congregation in 1869 when they began organizing men and women to build a sanctuary at this location. The congregation met in a brush arbor until a frame structure could be built. The frame church was destroyed in a fire in 1899.  The next building, built in 1900, was demolished in 1957 to make room for the current building.  The Fredonia Baptist Church also served as a school, known as the Fredonia School.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Even though Knoxville College was a private school, in 1891 the school contracted with the University of Tennessee to provide &quot;separate but equal&quot; industrial education for African Americans in lieu of their attending the publicly funded state university.  The money appropriated by the University of Tennessee could be used only for faculty, students, and equipment, not for buildings or land. While the Freedmen's Bureau had furnished funds for a mechanical and industrial building in 1892, it was the citizens of Knoxville who donated money for the construction of the brick agricultural building in 1905. Knoxville College owned a 78-acre farm with a small herd of dairy cattle, and was a local leader in food production and teaching home skills.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A group of African Americans being transferred to Nashville for safety during the Columbia Race Riot of 1946. Armed police line the outside of the jail with weapons drawn.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Columbia Race Riot took place in Columbia, Tennessee on the night of February 25-26, 1946. An African American U.S. Navy veteran became involved in an altercation with a white store clerk. Arrested and charged initially with disturbing the peace, James Stephenson, was later charged with intent to commit murder. Released on bond, Stephenson returned home and a white mob gathered at the Maury County Courthouse. By the end of the night, two African American men were killed while in police custody, the entire African American business district had been ransacked by whites, weapons had been confiscated from African Americans, and African Americans were arrested without warrants. More than 100 African Americans were arrested, and none were granted bail or allowed legal counsel.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The front page of the Nashville Globe, an African American newspaper published in Nashville, Tennessee during the first half of the twentieth century.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Following the passage of the law in 1905 that segregated street cars in Tennessee, Richard H. Boyd and a group of Nashville businessmen decided to start an African American newspaper.  This paper, the Nashville Globe, first appeared in newsstands in January 1906, and initial editions promoted the boycott of streetcars in reaction to the segregation law. The paper had close ties with the National Baptist Publishing Board, and all four original officers of the corporation – Henry A. Boyd, Dock A. Hart, J.O. Battle, and Charles Burrill – all worked for the National Baptist Publishing Board.  The Globe favored businessmen, the Republican Party, preached an ethos of self-help and betterment, and supported the philosophies and teachings of Booker T. Washington.  It remained in publication until 1960.</dc:description>

Report reached Nashville from vat

that it is estimated that by conserva-tive
thought 400,000 Negro soldiers
are fighting with the American

and that their deeds of heroism are
being heralded to the four corners
of the world. The allied generals

<dc:description>This photograph is one of at least sixteen images of African American businesses and homes in Nashville (several additional images of Fisk University and Roger Williams University students can be accessed here: http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/) that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. 220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A petition to repeal the poll tax.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Merl Eppse was a professor at Tennessee State University from 1928-1960. What is pictured here is a petition to repeal the poll tax. Poll taxes were enacted in Tennessee (and several other Southern states) as a way to disenfranchise those that they did not wish to participate in elections, such as African Americans. First enacted in 1870, it was not implemented by the legislature until 1889. In order to vote, one had to pay the poll tax; this act disenfranchised thousands of African Americans across the state. Beginning in the 1930s, groups such as the Tennessee Press Association and others, began to fight to have the poll tax law repealed. Petitions such as the ones seen here, were also circulated amongst the population and sent to Washington to protest the poll tax. The poll tax in Tennessee was repealed in 1953.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Silhouetted figure of a man, cut from black cloth, with his face turned in profile to his right, holds a silhouette of a guitar cut from red cloth in his left hand while his right hand stretches below towards a silhouette of the rays of a sun cut from orange cloth. He is surrounded by silhouettes of vegetation, cut from green and bluish green clothon three sides. A wide blue sleeve with a yellow star and band and what appears to be a white gloved hand touches his right shoulder. The central design block described here is surrounded by a plain wide light brown border, and the whole has been quilted in small squares.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The maker of this quilt was Rose Marie Phillips Thomas, whose husband, Wesley Marion Thomas, was in charge of education for African American workers employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. This is one of at least four known examples of the same design made by the wives of African Americans employed by TVA on the construction of dams in northern Alabama. The design, which bears a striking resemblance to the silhouetted figurative style of Harlem Renaissance muralist Aaron Douglas, was suggested by Ruth Clement Bond, whose husband, Max J. Bond, was Personnel Officer at the Tennessee Valley Authority, 1934-38. Ruth Clement Bond, originally from Louisville, KY, was an educator and civic leader with a B.A. and M.A. in English from Northwestern University. She  had been Head of the English department at Kentucky State College prior to coming to Wheeler Dam Village with her husband. After 1944, she taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. Her husband had earned a PhD in sociology and economics from USC in 1934. After his tenure at TVA, he served as Dean at Dillard University in New Orleans from 1938-1940 and Administrator at Tuskegee Institute from 1940-1944, when he joined the foreign service. He was President of the University of Liberia in the early 1950s. This information was excerpted from the essay, “The TVA Quilts,” in Soft Covers For Hard Times: Quiltmaking &amp; the Great Depression, by Merikay Waldvogel (Nashville:Rutledge Hill Press,1990): 78-82.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1918, Chattanooga opened its first public park for African Americans, a ten acre park with a center fountain. In 1938, a swimming pool was opened at the park. The park grew to include a mini-zoo, a Ferris Wheel, a dance hall, and a baseball field. The park had the first lighted softball fields for African Americans in the South. The Chattanooga Choo-Choos, an African American baseball team, played many games at Lincoln Park. The pool was closed in 1996, and the city gave the park to Erlanger Hospital in 1979. During the height of its popularity, Lincoln Park drew African Americans from as far away as Birmingham and Atlanta.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Knoxville's African American social life was lively and varied in the 1920s. According to historian Robert J. Booker, there were six dance halls in the black community by 1924. In the 1910s, several movie theaters opened in the Vine Street business district: the Gem and the Iola on Vine Street, and the Lincoln and Lyric theaters nearby. With the initiation of the East Tennessee Negro Fair at Chilhowee Park in 1925 came traveling acrobats, tap dancers, blues singers and minstrels, and boxing, and a dance band each evening. This photograph of dapper young men taken includes: seated, left to right, unidentified, Langley Tucker, Maynard James, Edgar Blair, Fred Miller; standing, left to right, Edward Ramsey, Robert Martin, Henry Jefferson, unidentified, unidentified, Hadyn Williams, Harvey Allen.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A group of five African American men and two women standing with a car and trailer parked in front of a two story brick building. The top story has been painted with the words &quot;Roosevelt Headquarters.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>In this photograph, a Democratic Party campaign trailer hitched to a late model automobile is parked in front of the Presnell building on Vine Street. Dr. James H. Presnell, who began practicing medicine in Knoxville in 1913, constructed this large brick building in 1922, at 503 Vine, the heart of Knoxville's African American business district. Dr. Presnell was an influential figure politically; when the Knoxville Flashlight Herald (a weekly African American paper) sponsored what historian Robert Booker calls a &quot;bronze mayor&quot; contest in 1937, Presnell was chosen to represent the community. Here, a marquee for the Atlanta Life Insurance Company hangs over the entry porch. There is a smaller marquee for Artcraft Studio below, and a sign for the Service Beauty School in the window at left. Two of the five men in the photograph wear military uniforms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Front-gable, frame building on a stone foundation, with attached steeple that forms a square tower entry vestibule on left side. The church is painted white, with a green raised seam metal roof, and located just across the Sequatchie River from Pikeville.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Thought to be the oldest rural African American church in Tennessee, this building also served as a school for African Americans until the construction of the Lincoln (Rosenwald) School in downtown Pikeville in 1925. Records of the county school superintendent for 1877 reveal that Fisk University students were serving as teachers, and that the school for African Americans was superior to the one for whites in Bledsoe County at the time. The church is located on a small rise beside the Sequatchie River, separated by a bridge from downtown Pikeville. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. According to research completed during the Rural African American Church survey conducted by the Center for Historic Preservation, it was known as the Mount Zion A.M.E. Church at one time. The steeple was added circa 1900.  More information and additional images can be found in the Southern Places digital collection at MTSU Walker Library.</dc:description>

<dc:description>&quot;Official Photograph&quot; of the Aunt Jemima pancake booth at the &quot;Century of Progress&quot; World's Fair, Chicago, 1933</dc:description>
<dc:description>The &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; brand, which was based on a minstrel show character, originated in St. Louis in 1889. Quaker Oats, which had purchased the brand in 1926, hired several women to represent the popular brand, including Maude Woodfork McElroy, who was living in Chicago. However, this newspaper photograph does not appear to be of Maude Woodfork McElroy who may not have taken the position until sometime after the Chicago fair. The New York Age (29 March 1947) reported that McElroy had been hired to play the radio part of &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; for a five-figure salary, that she had trained in the dramatic arts at Tennessee State University, and that she had originally come to Chicago to teach dramatics for the Works Progress Administration and that her husband, Charles McElroy, was a federal postal clerk in Chicago.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Maryville Republican was published by William Scott, Sr., a free black that moved to East Tennessee from North Carolina in 1847.  Following the Civil War, Scott and his family moved to Nashville as Scott was a delegate to the Colored Men's Convention.  During his time in Nashville, Scott and his son started the Colored Tennessean, the first African American newspaper in the state.  Scott moved back to Maryville in 1866, and started publishing the Maryville Republican.  The newspaper remained in publication until the 1880s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>C.C. Dodson was a Knoxville jeweller who had a shop in the Vine Avenue business district. This photograph of his home and family appears to have been taken at the same time as one of Dodson in his jewellery store, one of Mr. Manning's home and one of W.L. Smith's grocery store in Knoxville. This is one of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway for display at the Paris Exposition of 1900. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. 220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there. http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/</dc:description>

<dc:description>Jim Crow Blues, with lyrics by Harlem Renaissance poet Waring Cuney, was one of six songs protesting the status of African Americans, which were recorded by Josh[ua Daniel] White (1914-1969) under the title &quot;Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues.&quot; The songs were accompanied by notes written by Richard Wright. Other titles included in the same recording session were: Defense Factory Blues, Bad Housing Blues, Hard Times Blues, Uncle Sam Says, and Southern Exposure, which apparently addressed inequitable treatment of African Americans in the mobilization for World War II.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ticket and stub for a speech by Roscoe Conklin (sic) Simmons on Sunday April 6 at the Ryman Auditorium. &quot;Elks Ed Committee&quot; appears at the bottom of the ticket.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Presumably, the speaker was Roscoe Conkling Simmons (1881-1951), a popular orator and Republican politician who had served as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Defender during World War I. The addition of &quot;Elks Ed Committee&quot; at the bottom of the ticket suggests that the fraternal organization may have sponsored this public talk.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This image was scanned from an 18 x 12 inch poster reproducing a quilt in the collection of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The text under the image is as follows: ''Uncle Sam's Helping Hand'
This quilt was one of several made by African American women whose husbands worked on Wheeler Dam in Alabama in the 1930's. Many of these quilts conveyed appreciation for the improved living standard TVA brought to the region. 'Uncle Sam's Helping Hand' is on permanent display in TVA's Historical Collection in Knoxville, Tennessee.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:description>This quilt was made by Rose Lee Cooper. It is one of several of the same design crafted by the wives of men employed at TVA's Wheeler, Pickwick, and other dam sites in northern Alabama. The design, which bears a striking resemblance to the silhouetted figurative style of Harlem Renaissance muralist Aaron Douglas, was suggested by Ruth Clement Bond, whose husband, Max J. Bond was Personnel Officer at the Tennessee Valley Authority, 1934-38. A period photograph of a similar quilt, which was used to illustrate an October 1935 article in The Crisis (NAACP journal) by John P. Davis about TVA's treatment of African American workers, captioned the image &quot;Rugs made by wives of TVA workers in Muscle Shoals area. Motif from Aaron Douglas.&quot; Ruth Clement Bond, originally from Louisville, KY, was an educator and civic leader who had been Head of the English department at Kentucky State College prior to coming to Wheeler Dam Village with her husband. After 1944, she taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. Her husband had earned a PhD in sociology and economics from USC in 1934. Following his tenure at TVA, Max J. Bond served as Dean at Dillard University in New Orleans from 1938-1940 and Administrator at Tuskegee Institute from 1940-1944, when he joined the foreign service. He was President of the University of Liberia in the early 1950s. This information was excerpted from the essay, “The TVA Quilts,” in Soft Covers For Hard Times: Quiltmaking &amp; the Great Depression, by Merikay Waldvogel (Nashville:Rutledge Hill Press,1990): 78-82.  Bond, in an interview with Waldvogel, did not recall specifically modeling the work on that of Aaron Douglas, and also mentioned Henri Matisse as an influence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Reverend Lonzie Odie Taylor (circa 1899-1977) became pastor of Olivet Baptist Church, 270 East Calhoun, Memphis, in 1931, serving the church until the 1950s. He was also a prolific photographer, whose black and white images of Memphis's African American community, both posed in a studio setting and in the busy business district of Beale Street and neighboring areas, captured a dynamic period of middle class prosperity and achievement from the 1920s to the 1960s. Taylor also made 16mm films, including this excerpt showing voters at a temporary neighborhood polling place. Blanche Taylor donated her husband's invaluable archive, which consists of thousands of negatives, five hundred still images, approximately 15 hours of color and black-and-white film, sound recordings, and manuscripts, to the Center for Southern Folklore.</dc:description>

In the decades after the American Civil War, Johnson became a prosperous, law-abiding saloon owner, founded a horse-racing track, and owned several race horses. In 1896, he was invited by the East Tennessee Track Association to build a new track located in East Knoxville. He donated property for an African American YWCA in 1906 and constructed this commercial building at the corner of Vine and Central Avenues in 1915.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A photograph of Benjamin Singleton and S.A. McClure superimposed over an image, apparently taken in Nashville, Tennessee, of a steamboat with passengers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Benjamin Singleton was born into slavery in 1809. He eventually escaped his owners and fled to Canada. Following the Civil War, Singleton returned to Nashville and organized a homestead assocation around 1869 with Columbus N. Johnson to promote the resettlement of African Americans to lands in the western United States. This movement was known as the &quot;Exoduster&quot; movement, and several thousand African Americans in Nashville and Middle Tennessee joined the movement, settling in townships in Kansas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Free Hill, a neighborhood containing homes, a church and cemetery, and a former Rosenwald School, located on a hill near Celina, Tennessee, is a historically African American-owned community. There is an intact legacy of old-time string band musicians as well as sacred music associated with Free Hill. The Tennessee Folklore Society, in conjunction with the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project at the Department of Conservation, recorded an album entitled &quot;Free Hill: A Sound Portrait of a Rural Afro-American Community (TFS 107) in 1983. It included not only musical selections but also historical remembrances and local lore. This photograph of members of the Barlow family is on display in the Free Hill Community Center, a well-preserved example of a two-room Rosenwald School.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A photogaph of the teachers and students at Trenton Rosenwald School in Trenton, Tennessee, taken in 1939.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Trenton Rosenwald School was built in 1928-1929 as an eight-teacher school at the cost of $14,600.  The Rosenwald Fund provided $2,100 for construction while the rest of the funds came from the African American community and public funds.  This school design was one used for the construction of larger schools.  In 1951, Carrie Booker Seats noted in her thesis about African American schools in Gibson County that the school had become overcrowded and was in the process of being renovated.  At that time, the school had twelve grades and fifteen teachers. The building currently at this location was built in the 1950s-1960s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A floor plan for a five teacher school as part of the Community School Plans developed by Samuel L. Smith and Fletcher B. Dressler for the Rosenwald Fund.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1921, Samuel L. Smith and Fletcher B. Dressler published the first official Community School Plans bulletin for use by the Rosenwald Fund.  These plans derived from earlier plans Smith had developed in the 1910s and that had already been used in some Rosenwald Schools.  The plans show Smith and Dressler's belief in the importance of simplicity of design, the use of natural lighting, and the importance of sanitation.  The plans oriented buildings as to maximize natural light, using banks of tall, narrow windows to provide adequate lighting for students.  In addition to providing lighting, the windows also provided ventilation for the classroom and allowed for the circulation of air. The plans were designed for simplicity to make them affordable for local school boards to implement.  The plans were offered without cost to both white and African American schools across the South, leading to the construction of many rural schools using these plans.</dc:description>

There is a man with a plain uniform and no cap at front center, holding a bat atop a pile of baseball gloves. An older man wearing a plain uniform and a hat with brim stands between the rows at far left.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The State of Tennessee created several &quot;state training schools&quot; or reform schools for teenaged offenders.  Originally called the school for &quot;negro boys,&quot; this school on the Cumberland Plateau, just up the mountain from Pikeville, was later renamed the Tennessee State Technical &amp; Agricultural  School for Colored Boys. This image of a baseball team, posed against the wall of a modern-looking building, probably dates from after 1945, as facilities at the school were remodeled and upgraded about that time. The posed photograph seems designed to give the impression that recreational activities were a regular part of life for the young inmates.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Thirty-five or more young African Americans, many wearing overalls, standing or seated at school desks and pew-like benches in a room with brick walls and a wood floor.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the early decades of the twentieth century, the State of Tennessee created several &quot;state training schools&quot; or reform schools for teenaged offenders.  The school for &quot;negro boys&quot; was located near Pikeville on the Cumberland Plateau. Conditions there came to public attention after a violent series of events in 1944 that included the apparent murder of the wife and daughter of superintendent H.E. Scott and the &quot;lynching&quot; of the teenager suspected of killing the two. After revelations that the facilities were inadequate, overcrowded, and unsanitary, modern fire-proof buildings were constructed in 1945.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cover of Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All its Phases. Miss Ida B. Wells. New York Age Print, 1892. A cream colored booklet with image of the author.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Ida B. Wells (1862-1931) was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the daughter of former slaves. While  teaching in a public school, just outside of the city of Memphis, she mounted an unsuccessful challenge to the segregation of public railroad cars in Memphis. Although she was at first awarded damages in her lawsuit challenging the Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad Company, the victory was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. Wells became an outspoken advocate for African American rights and began publishing articles in African American newspapers, first in Memphis and later nationall. In 1892, Wells wrote to the New York Age, to protest the closing of her  Memphis newspaper, The Free Speech. This booklet, which was reprinted in 1893 and 1894, is an expanded version of her June 25, 1892 editorial.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Artist and illustrator Cyrus Leroy Baldridge (1889-1977) attended the Chicago School of Illustration as a boy. He worked as an illustrator after graduation from the University of Chicago and served as a war correspondent during World War I. While in the American infantry, he contributed to the Stars and Stripes, Leslie's Weekly and Scribners. His first book &quot;I Was There with the Yanks in France&quot; was a collection of his wartime sketches. After his marriage to Caroline Singer, the two traveled in Africa, mostly along the west coast, during the mid to late 1920s, staying in native villages in order to glean an understanding of the homelands and customs of the ancestors of contemporary African Americans. W.W. Norton published their book, entitled &quot;White Africans and Black,&quot; written by Singer and illustrated by Baldridge, in 1929. During his career, Baldridge illustrated books for African American authors and worked for Opportunity, the magazine of the Urban League. Chicago businessman Samuel Insull purchased the collection of sketches from Baldridge's African sojourn and donated them to Fisk University in 1931.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Essay by Dr. Henry Morgan Green in The Knoxville Negro, published by Trent Printing Co. 2104 Magnolia Ave. Knoxville, Tenn. U.S.A., June 1929 </dc:description>
<dc:description>In the opening essay for this promotional booklet, Dr. Henry Morgan Green, a pioneering Knoxville physician and esteemed community leader, assessed the social and material growth of Knoxville's African American population. Green was well-qualified to analyze the city's progress, having graduated from Knoxville College, helped found a short-lived medical college there, and been successful in his own medical practice. He also chaired the Negro Department at the Appalachian Exposition of 1910, at which a handsome separate building, designed and built by African Americans, was erected to house exhibits related to African American accomplishments. In this essay, Green lays out what he sees as four important measures of progress that would place Knoxville in the forefront of American cities of the period: moral worth (the number of churches and congregations); intellectual achievement (notable educational institutions); material growth (home and business ownership); and industrial application. Of the latter, he wrote &quot;Knoxville through its multitudinous industrial activities, furnishes an abundance of opportunities for gainful occupation . . . because of the cordial race relations existing, he [the Knoxville Negro] has access to all kinds of classes of labor...&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Meharry Medical College began in 1876 as the medical school of Central Tennessee College, established by the Freedmen's Aid Society. The founder and first president was George W. Hubbard, a former Union soldier. In 1915, Meharry Medical College was granted a charter separate from Central Tennessee College. The college moved to north Nashville, one block from Fisk University, in the late 1920s, and its new buildings adopted the collegiate gothic style of architecture found on the neighboring Fisk campus. Meharry Medical College grew to include a School of Dentistry, a School of Medicine, and a School of Nursing, as well as other departments. Meharry Medical College continues to educate health care professionals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lansky's was a menswear store located at 126 Beale Street, near the corner of south Second Street, in Memphis, from 1946 until the 1980s, when it moved into new spaces in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel at 149 Union.  Samuel Lansky put up the money to purchase a store on Beale Street for his sons just after World War II.  Bernard (1927-2012)  built the business from a dry goods store, to an army surplus store, to a fashion center. Through his personal relationship with Elvis Presley, he turned it into an internationally-acclaimed celebrity outfitter and tourist mecca. As Lansky related it in a 2005 interview, Elvis rented a tuxedo when he was in high school and bought his first suit there, continuing to buy tailored jackets, pants, and coats from Bernard Lansky throughout his career.  Lansky's descendants still own and operate the Lansky stores at the Peabody Hotel.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Promise Land community was first settled by freedmen during Reconstruction.The African American Bowen, Redden, and Vanleer families purchased one thousand acres in what would become Promise Land circa 1870. In 1881, the Nesbitt brothers purchased land for a school and a church, forming the nucleus of the community.  By 1900, there were three churches in the community as well as several stores.  The building pictured here was partially constructed in 1899, replacing an earlier school which had been destroyed by fire.  Promise Land may have been Dickson County's largest African American community during the first half of the twentieth century.  The school, closed in 1957, is now used as a community center.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cover of a published legal brief filed by Greer &amp; Adams and T.F. Cassels, and sections 19-23 of transcribed testimony regarding a case before the Tennessee Supreme Court in April 1885.</dc:description>
<dc:description>On September 15th 1883, twenty-year old, Fisk University-educated, school teacher Ida B. Wells purchased a  ticket for a trip by train from Memphis to Woodstock (ten miles north of Memphis), where she was teaching at a public school. She chose a seat in the rear car with white ladies and gentlemen but was forcibly removed and told to move to the forward car, where smoking and drinking were allowed and where black and white passengers rode together. She refused and sought damages in a challenge to Tennessee's 1882 statute, which ordered common carriers to provide &quot;accomodations equal in all respects in comfort and convenience to the first-class cars on the train...&quot; for non-white passengers. The case, in which she was represented by prominent Memphis attorney, Thomas Frank Cassels, a free black who had served in the 42nd Tennessee General Assembly (1881-1883), was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in April 1885. The Court found for the Railroad Company, reversing the earlier decision by the Circuit Court of Shelby County.</dc:description>
