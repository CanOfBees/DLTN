<dc:description>The sketchbook details sketches made by Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  After several lucrative commissions, he took his wife and two daughters, Emily and Jane, to Europe.  It was an opportune time to go as there were few prospects of obtaining new work.  Because of a financial panic and accompanying labor unrest, no one had the finances or inclination for civil building.  Except for a few Federal commissions, Strickland remained idle for the next several years.  In January 1838, he and his family sailed from Philadelphia for Liverpool, England, and remained abroad for about six months.</dc:description>

<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  In Rome, Strickland was fascinated with architecture and antiquities.  It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.  The Forum Boarium was located on a flat area near the Tiber River between the Capitoline, the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was the cattle forum of Ancient Rome, and the oldest forum in Rome.  The Forum Boarium was the site of the first gladiatorial contest in 264 B.C. Ponte de Rotto, the first all-stone bridge over the Tiber is the remains of an original arch belonging to the Ponte S. Maria, which after two previous collapses was reconstructed under Pope Gregory XIII (before 1575) on the rests of the ancient bridge, Pons Aemilius, built in 179 B.C. It was here the first bridges were built.   A flood in 1598 took away an arch of the bridge. The only piece left during Strickland's visit was &quot;Ponte di Rotto&quot; (meaning &quot;broken bridge&quot;). Ponte Cestia was built in 46 B.C. by the consul Cestius. In 365 A.D., it was almost entirely rebuilt by the Emperor Valens and his sons. The bridge was restored in 1192. The Temple of Portunus, incorrectly known as the &quot;Temple of Fortuna Virilis&quot; (Latin &quot;manly fortune&quot;) was dedicated to Protunus, the god of keys, doors, livestock, and warehouses. The temple was built ca. 100 B.C. and restored in the 1st Century. It was converted to a church in 872 and rededicated as the &quot;Santa Maria Egyziaca&quot; (St. Mary of Egypt). The Temple of Hercules Victor (Temple of Vesta) is a round temple of Greek design surrounded by columns. It was once mistaken for a temple of Vesta, but it has been determined to be a temple of Hercules. Hercules was a favorite divinity for traders, so it is appropriate that it would be in this forum. The building was constructed ca. 120 B.C. and is the earliest surviving marble building in Rome. By 1132, the temple had been converted to a church, known as &quot;St. Stephen of Carriages.&quot;</dc:description>

It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.  The Palace of the Lateran (Palace of Constantine) is an ancient palace of the Roman Empire and later a palace of the Popes.  It is the oldest and ranks first among the four great basilicas of Rome.  The site was, in ancient times, occupied by the palace of the family of the Laterani. The palace eventually came into the hands of Constantine, the first Christian emperor, through his wife, Fausta. Constantine gave it to the church in the time of Miltiades, no later than ca. 311. From that time it has always been the center of Christian life within Rome, the residence of the popes and the Cathedral of Rome. Off the left transept of the basilica is the 13th Century cloister, the work of Jacapo and Pietro Vassalletto (ca. 1220-1236), and an example of Cosmatesque art. The columns, as pictured, some plain and some twisted, are adorned with mosaics and have varied capitals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>After Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled north through Northern Italy and into parts of Germany and France.  The Tivoli Falls are segmented falls that run beneath the town of Tivoli, then plunge down a wooded hillside below.  The largest segment, the two-tiered Grand Cascata and the segmented Cascatelle are the two main portions of the Aniene Falls.  The tunnels, completed by Pope Gregory XVI in 1835, were the attempts to divert high waters and save Tivoli from seasonal flooding, such as the devastating flood in 1826.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels he made sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.  He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's.  His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846.  He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.  Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Temple of Jupiter Stator (Latin meaning &quot;the stayer&quot;) was first vowed, traditionally, by Romulus at the critical moment in the battle between the Romans and the Sabines, when Romans had been driven across the Forum valley. This temple was never built, but in 294 B.C., the Consul, Marcus Atilus Regalus, made a similiar vow under similar circumstances in a battle with the Samnites, and erected the temple immediately afterwards. On November 8, 63 A.D., Consul Marcus Tullius Cicero convened the Senate to a meeting in the temple, where he held his first oration against Catiline. The location of the temple is not known with absolute certainty. The written sources give some hint, such as near or just outside of the Porta Magonia, on the higher end of the Via Sacra, or just on the Palatine. When a Medieval tower was demolished in 1827, the ruins of an ancient building appeared, and these remains are frequently identified as the foundations of the Temple of Jupiter Stator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, and travelled north.  Radicofani, located between Rome and Florence, may have been one of his stopping places.  The fortress of Radicofani was established ca. 973, and sits on the top of an imposing basaltic cliff from which it dominates the whole territory between Monte Cetona, the Orcia Valley and Monte Aniata.  Initially, Radicofani was under the control of the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Aniata.  Throughout the years the fortress was disputed between the Abbey and the Counts of Aldobrandeschi; it passed under the control of the Counts of Chiusi, part of which they donated in the 12th Century to the Bishop of Siena. The fortress was the center of a war between Ottone IV and the Pope (1210-1214), and then between Firenze and Siena (1229-1235). In 1263, having given shelter to the Siena Guelfi, it was, for the most part, destroyed by the Ghibelline forces. It was during this period that the legendary figure of Ghino di Tacco, a Ghibelline &quot;Robin Hood,&quot; made the fortress a base for his adventures. His exploits were recorded by Dante and Boccaccio. In 1559, the fortress became part of the holdings of the Medici family.</dc:description>

<dc:description>After Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled north into Germany and France.  This sketch represents an unnamed suspension bridge on the Saone River in France.  A suspension bridge is one where cables or ropes are strung across a river and the deck is suspended from the cables.  Suspension bridges have towers through which the cables are strung.  Thus, the towers are supporting the majority of the roadway's weight.  The design of the suspension bridge was developed in the early 19th Century. The suspensions in these early bridges were made from chain or linked bars. The bridges on the Saone River were built by order of the French government and the local departments were taxed to defray the costs of construction. The majority of the bridges on this river were constructed between 1830 and 1838.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The sketchbook is of detailed drawings made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.  One of his most ambitious drawings is of the Pont du Gard, an aqueduct in the south of France, located near Remoulins.  Built on three levels, it is 49 meters high, and the longest level is 275 meters long.  Construction began in the middle of the 1st Century A. D.  Its construction is atrributed to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Designed to carry water across the small Gardon River valley, it was part of a nearly 31-mile aqueduct that brought water to the Roman city of Nimes. It was constructed entirely without the use of mortar. The stones, some of which weigh up to 6 tons, are held together with iron clamps. The masonry was lifted into place by block and tackle, with a human-powered treadmill providing the power for the winch. It is believed to have taken about 3 years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers. From the Middle Ages to the 18th Century, the aqueduct was used as a conventional bridge to facilitate foot traffic across the river. The aqueduct was restored in the 18th Century and by Strickland's time, it had become a major tourist site.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France, and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.   The Sepulchre of Caecilia Metella is the Appian Way's most famous funerary monument.  The Roman noblewoman to whom the monument is dedicated was related by birth and marriage to two of the most illustrious families of the Republican era.  Her father, Quintus Caecilius Metello had been a consul, defeated the pirate fleets and conquered the island of Crete. Also, her husband had served with Caesar in Gaul from 57 to 51 B.C., and held important high offices. Inside the mausoleum, the funeral chamber is circular and rises from the floor to ceiling in the form of a cone. This is where the urn containing the ashes of the deceased were kept, of which nothing is known. It was converted into a tomb by the Caetani family, who added the pinnacle and built a palace.</dc:description>

<dc:description>After Strickland and his family arrived in Liverpool in 1838, he traveled to London and visited various engineering friends. He became interested in recent railway and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway.  The Great Western Railway was a Bristol (England) Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering linking Southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London.  The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The company was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his chief ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. He used a gauge of 7 1/4 feet, known as the &quot;Broad Guage.&quot; He also urged the use of timber instead of stone blocks to support the rails. The first stretch of line from Paddinton London to Taplow near Maidenhead opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity until it became part of British Railways at nationalization in 1948.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.  The tomb of Nero was located 6 miles from Rome on the Via Flaminia.  Nero was born in 37 A.D., and was the fifth and last emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  He ruled from 54 to 68 A.D.  During his rule, Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and increasing the cultural capital of the empire. He ordered the building of theaters and promoted athletic games. His reign included a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire (58-63 A.D.). Popular legend remembers Nero as a libertine and a tyrant. Galba's Hispanic revolt of 68 A.D. led to his reported suicide, and the civil war that ensued from his death. The Via Flaminia was a Roman road leading from Rome to Ariminum (Rimini), and was the most important route to the north. It was constructed by Gaius Flaminius during his censorship (220 B.C.). It became the main axis of transportation by which wheat from the Po Valley supplied Rome and central Italy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman architecture and culture.  He seemed to express some anti-Roman Catholic biases in this sketch.  He also believed that papal influences had a negative effect on architecture.  Pope Gregory XVI (1765-1846), born Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari, was Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1831 to 1846.  Strongly conservative and traditionalist, he opposed democratic and modernizing reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe, seeking to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy. A cardinal is a senior ecclesiastical official, usually a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church and member of the College of Cardinals, which as a body elects a new pope. The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, &quot;Capuccini Sacerdate&quot;, is an order of friars in the Roman Catholic Church, among the chief offshoots of the Franciscans. The order arose in 1520 when Matteo de Bascio, a Franciscan friar, became possessed of the idea that the manner of life led by the Franciscans was not the one which St. Francis had envisioned. He sought to return to the primitive way of life, stressing solitude and penance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  After he arived in Liverpool, he traveled to London, where he visited friends and sketched recent railway and locomotive construction, as well as the famous Crosby Hall.  Crosby Hall stood in a court on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, a short distance from the parish church of St. Helen's.  The hall that remained in the late 18th Century was a part of a large mansion that had been built by Sir John Crosby, a grocer and wool merchant, in the reign of Edward IV. Richard III, as Duke of Gloucester, made the mansion his London home for some time, and William Shakespeare mentions the hall in his play, &quot;Richard III.&quot; After the Great Fire of London in 1666, much of the mansion was demolished. Only the Great Hall, and several adjoining chambers remained. Over the years, Crosby Hall was used as offices for the East India Company, as a commercial premises and a meeting hall for Protestant dissenters. The Hall was eventually demolished in the early 20th Century.</dc:description>

<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  Strickland was especially interested in Roman architecture and antiquities and highly critical of papal-sponsored architecture.  He visited Rome until mid-April 1838.  Attila (ca. 406-453) was the monarch of the Huns from 434 until his death.  His empire stretched from the Netherlands to the Ural River and from the Danube River to the Baltic Sea.  During his rule he was one of the most fearsome of the Western and Eastern Roman Empire's enemies. He invaded the Balkans twice, besieging Constantinople on the second invasion. He marched through Gaul (modern France) as far as Orleans before being defeated at the Battle of Chalons, and he drove the Western emperor Valentinian III from his capital at Ravenna in 452. Attila is known in Western history and tradition as the grim &quot;scourge of God,&quot; and his name has become a byword for cruelty and barbarism.</dc:description>

He became interested in recent railroad and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway. The Great Western Railway was a Bristol Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering, linking southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London.  The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The company was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his chief ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. The first stretch of the line from Paddington (London) to Taplow, near Maidenhead, opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity unitl it became part of British Railways at Nationalization in 1948.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels, he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.  He sketched Roman antiquities, medieval towers and Renaissance St. Peter's.  His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles which were published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846.  He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.  Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Basilica of St. Peter ranks second among the four major basilicas of Rome. It is the most prominent building inside the Vatican City. Possibly the largest church in Christianity, it covers an area of 5.7 acres and has a capacity of over 60,000 people. One of the holiest sites in Christendom, it is, traditionally, the burial site of St. Peter, first Bishop of Rome. Construction of the basilica began on April 18, 1506, and was completed in 1626.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Pantheon was begun in 27 B.C. by the statesman, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. It was completely rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian sometime between 118 A.D. and 128 A.D., with alterations made in the early 3rd Century by the emperors, Lucius Septimius Serverus and Caracalla. It is a circular building of concrete faced with brick, with a great concrete dome rising from the walls and witha  front porch of Corinthian columns supporting a gabled roof with a triangular pediment. Beneath the porch are huge bronze doors 24 feet high, the earliest known examples of this type. The Pantheon was dedicated in 609 A.D. as the Church of Santa Maria Rotunda or Ad Martres, which it remains today. In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.  He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's.  His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846.  He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.  Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany.</dc:description>

The Tomb of Cestius is an Egyptian-style pyramid in Rome, near the Porta San Paolo and the Protestant Cemetery. The pyramid is a funerary monument built about 12 B.C. as a tomb for Caius Cestius, Roman praetor, tribune of the people and member of one of the four religious corporations (the Septemviri Epulonum). It is of brick-faced concrete, covered with slabs of white marble. In the 3rd Century, the pyramid was included in the Aurelian Walls, close to the Porta San Paolo, one of the Southern gates. Porta San Paolo is flanked by two cylindrical towers and has two entrances. Near Porta San Paolo, alongside the Pyramid is the Protestant Cemetery, a burial place for non-Catholics. The most famous graves are those of the English poets, John Keats (1795-1821) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822).</dc:description>

<dc:description>After Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, he traveled north through Northern Italy and into parts of Germany and France.  This unnamed suspension bridge was located near the town of Chalons sur Saone in central France and a part of the Burgundy region.  It is located on the Saone River, and in Strickland's time was a well known river port.  There were 13 suspension bridges across the Saone between Chalons sur Saone and Lyons, varying in their span from 180 feet to 360 feet.  These</dc:description>

<dc:description>After William Strickland and his family arrived in Liverpool, England in 1838, he traveled to London and visited various engineering friends. He became interested in recent railroad and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway. The Great Western Railway was a Bristol Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering, linking southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London.  The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The country was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. He used a gauge of 7 1/4 feet known as the &quot;Broad Gauge.&quot; He also urged the use of timber instead of stoneblocks to support the rails. The first stretch of the line from Paddington (London) to Taplow near Maidenhead, opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity until it became part of the British Railways at nationalization in 1848.</dc:description>
