<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement.  As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol.  The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States.  The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This broadside reflects a popular fascination with the exotic that was intensified by the British annexation of Burma in the 1880s. Tensions had been growing between Britain and Burma since the 1840s, and the issues of multiple sovereignty in the region had created further relationship difficulties.  Britain's interests in the security of India and in Burma's raw materials and trade potential were factors that led to the establishment of British colonial authority in Burma in the 1880s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Twentieth century public health records for Tennessee reflect an increasing emphasis on disease prevention and the increasing state responsibility for public health and education.  Following major outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever across the state from 1832 through 1873, a State Board of Health was created for Tennessee in 1875, and many jurisdictions hired health officers.  Localities became more involved in issues of public health and vital statistics, as this broadside illustrates.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Faced with the difficulties inherent in the unprecedented admission of a territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1789 as well as the election-year struggle between the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans, Tennessee sent a printed copy of its constitution and a report on census returns to Congress for approval on April 8, 1796.  Tennessee became the sixteenth state admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796.</dc:description>

<dc:description>DeLong Rice was deeply inspired when he heard Bob Taylor speak in 1888.  A business association ensued, leading to Rice's management of Taylor's lecture tours beginning in 1891.  Taylor quickly became the highest-priced professional lecturer in the country.  Rice organized his Rice Lyceum Bureau in 1900 and staged high-quality lecture and entertainment tours across the South. Such cultural events served as an educational resource for the audience.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A gristmill or grist mill is a building where grain is ground into flour, or the grinding mechanism itself. In many countries these are referred to as corn mills or flour mills. Classical mill designs are usually water powered, though some are windmills, or powered by livestock. The millstones themselves turn at around 120 rpm. They are laid one on top of the other. The bottom stone, called the bed, is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the runner, is mounted on a separate spindle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Lousiville-Nashville Railroad, or L. &amp; N. Railroad was a rail service that began operation in 1850, though the tracks were not laid from Louisville to Nashville until 1859. The rail line saw service in the Civil War and existed in various configurations before being consolidated into Seaboard System Railroads in 1982.  Today, it is CSX.  The R. J. Meigs referred to in this broadside is, in all probability, Return Jonathan Meigs, a member of the Committee which drafted the first Code of Tennessee (also known as the Meigs-Cooper Code).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Patent medicine is a term given to various medical or pseudo-medical compounds sold under a variety of names and labels. The term has become particularly associated with the sale of drug compounds in the nineteenth century under cover of colorful names and even more colorful claims. The promotion of patent medicines was one of the first major successes of the advertising industry, and many advertising and sales techniques were pioneered by patent medicine promoters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The minstrel show, or minstrelsy, was an American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, performed by white people in blackface or even, especially after the Civil War, blacks in blackface. Minstrel shows lampooned African Americans as ignorant, lazy, buffoonish, superstitious, joyous, and musical. The heyday of the minstrel show was the period between 1840 and 1880.</dc:description>

She married Andrew Jackson, Sr. in Carrickfergus about 1765. After seeing her son, Andrew, through a near-fatal case of smallpox, she went to Charleston to nurse captured American soldiers languishing on British prisoner-of-war ships. She contracted cholera in Charleston and died when the future president was 14 years old.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the Great Road (Wilderness Road) running through Abingdon and continuing on to Kingsport, Tennessee, Abingdon was a well-developed center of population for Southwest Virginia at the time of this bill.  Stagecoach lines had been running out of Abingdon since the late 1700s.  The first stages coming into Tennessee entered the eastern part of the state as extensions of Virginia routes like this one. Many stops were private residences, defense stations, or the homes of militia officers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the onset of World War II, numerous challenges confronted the American people. The government found it necessary to ration food, gas, and even clothing during that time. Americans were asked to conserve  everything and people were often required to give up many material goods. Their efforts included scrap drives, taking factory jobs, goods donations, and other similar projects to assist those on the front.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Phrenology was the study of skull features made popular in the early 19th Century.  It is now largely considered to be a pseudo-science. The subject of this examination, &quot;John A. Murril&quot; is probably the infamous John A. Murrell, a colorful antebellum Tennessee outlaw.</dc:description>
