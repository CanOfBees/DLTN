<dc:description>These two pages each have a heading - &quot;Same Monotony Until&quot; and &quot;Exodus Once More&quot; but nothing has been drawn. It appears that Mitchener did not have the time to draw what he wanted under each title heading.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during WWII after a bombing mission in Germany. On the night of January 27, 1945, the men at Stalag Luft III were evacuated. Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps that were about to be liberated by the Red Army. After a blizzard march and horrendous conditions, the men arrived in Nuremberg. Hunger was a danger, as well as Allied bombings. Eventually, the men were forced to move onwards towards Munich. They were liberated in late April.</dc:description>

<dc:coverage>Zagan (Poland)</dc:coverage>
<dc:date>1944-1945</dc:date>
<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland.  Christmas Day in 1944 at Stalag Luft III was cold but clear. The men were given Red Cross parcels with canned turkey, cookies, and plum pudding. The Germans gave them party hats and noisemakers, but the atmosphere was still grim. The Allied troops were stalled along the Siegfried Line, and the men feared that they would be prisoners indefinitely.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was captured and sent to Stalag Luft III. Life as a POW in Germany involved hunger, cold, boredom, and overcrowded conditions.  The three-story wooden sentry towers seen here were known as &quot;Goon Boxes&quot; and were located at the perimeter of the compounds. Stalag Luft III was the site of the famous Great Escape, in which 80 POWs attempted to escape in late March 1944; Hitler later ordered the execution of 50 escapees.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II shows a song along with a tiny illustration of a soldier in prison. The song is called &quot;Thanks for the Memories&quot; and is attributed to L. G. Young, POW. The song is a parody and makes light of the uncomfortable aspects of being a prisoner. The song continues on the next page.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II shows two different images. The first is an eagle with a ball and chain on its feet. A banner, &quot;Kriege Klarion,&quot; is pictured below the eagle, and the words, &quot;To preserve the democratic, its contemporary&quot; are written below this. The image appears to refer to an underground POW news bulletin or something similar. The second image reads, &quot;Stalag Stump,&quot; and includes the phrases, &quot;waiting at the gate&quot; and &quot;current in the Reich.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener served as a second lieutenant in the 351st Bombardment Group, 8th Air Force. He was shot down and captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. News at some POW camps was often distributed through underground publications,  such as POW WOW (Prisoners of War Waiting on Winning), created at Stalag Luft I. The &quot;Kriege Klarion&quot; may have been a similar publication. The Germans sent some POW news publications to local print shops. The POWs called themselves Kriegies.</dc:description>

Although Germany was expected to uphold the 1929 Geneva Convention, prisoners at Dulag Luft were often treated poorly and put into solitary confinement. From there, they were shipped to the various Stalag Luft camps throughout Germany.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary from World War II includes a drawing of two men trying to remove tree stumps from the ground at the prison camp. He has written, &quot;In order that there be parade grounds&quot; on the top of the page. Underneath the drawing, he explains, &quot;For three months, or thereabout, details were busy clearing stumps and other debris. That Appel [sic] formations might more nearly approach the military.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III, a POW camp in Silesia. The area was covered with trees, so the men were responsible for clearing trees and stumps in order to establish more functional land. The area around Zagan was also known for its particularly sandy soil. Appell formations were the roll call at 7:00 A.M. Prisoners would congregate while officials performed a count. Recounts were frequently conducted.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany and he was sent to the POW camp Stalag Luft III. Blank journals were given to soldiers through the War Prisoners Aid of the Young Men's Christian Association.  In 1939, the World's Committee of the YMCA, which was headquartered in Geneva, established the War Prisoners Aid so that the recreational, educational, and spiritual needs of prisoners could be met. The International Red Cross Committee provided books for prisoners.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was captured as a POW and sent to Stalag Luft III during WWII. Theater groups were very popular at all of the Luft camps. Materials were supplied by the YMCA, so Kriegies (POWs) were able to make costumes and stage scenery. They made theater seats from Red Cross food crates. Tin cans could be used to make chandeliers. The men formed musical groups (using YMCA instruments) such as the &quot;Sagan Serenaders.&quot; The YMCA also provided playbooks, but prisoners also wrote and produced their own plays.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured during World War II after a bombing raid in Germany; he was sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan (or Zagan). Life in POW camps involved insufficient food, clothing, and overcrowded living conditions.  The facilities were frequently cold and uncomfortable. Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks (known as blocks), a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, and a building that served as a theater and chapel.</dc:description>

One of the institutions created by the prisoners was the &quot;Foodaco.&quot;  This &quot;Stalag Swap Shop&quot; was located in the camp cookhouse. Red Cross food was exchanged through a barter system, in which cigarettes were used as the primary means of exchange. Each item had its own price or point value. &quot;Foodaco&quot; was an abbreviation of  &quot;food account.&quot;</dc:description>

Bolshevists repulsed. Escape is no longer a sport.&quot; The last section probably refers to compliance with the Third Geneva Convention (1929) governing the treatment of POWs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener served as a second lieutenant in the 8th Air Force. He was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. POWs often obtained their news through secretly distributed, underground publications, such as POW WOW (Prisoners of War Waiting on Winning), created at Stalag Luft I. Other news was obtained through Allied and German radio broadcasts. When war news arrived, information was posted on large handmade maps that hung from the walls of the blocks.</dc:description>

Mitchener writes, &quot;There are sundry others - space dictates - - and lack of ability incurs limitations -- so with -- Thoughts of one far better -- We return - opposite.&quot; The prisoner is wearing old, tattered clothing, and looks bedraggled.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. POWs often suffered from depression during their internment. This was referred to as &quot;barbed wire disease.&quot; When the men were captured, they were frequently told, &quot;For you the war is over.&quot; The men were frustrated that they could no longer participate in the war effort. In order to confound the Germans, they frequently attempted to escape. POWs usually felt demoralized and frustrated, and they longed for freedom.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II includes a drawing of wooden barrack #170. Mitchener describes his quarters as including ten rooms, housing 8-14 men each. He writes,&quot;Constructed of wood, plaster, and tarpaper - a few bolts - a sprinkling of nails - and preserved with 'sand.' Heated by ersatz coal...but damn' damp and cold! Not quite like home.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks called blocks, a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, a theater and a chapel building. A barracks building housed about 150 men. There were about twelve to fifteen sleeping rooms in each barrack, which were furnished with benches, lockers, a table, and double or triple bunk beds. Lighting was poor.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was sent to the POW camp Stalag Luft III. Blank journals were given to soldiers through the War Prisoners Aid of the Young Men's Christian Association. In 1939, the World's Committee of the YMCA, which was headquartered in Geneva, established the War Prisoners Aid so that the recreational, educational, and spiritual needs of prisoners could be met. The International Red Cross Committee provided books for prisoners.</dc:description>

Mitchener writes, &quot;As you enter the room - life's sustinence (sic) compartment...The Food Closet. By-paths for ingenuity, the clothes locker lying on its side...clothes hooks as cup racks - bread boxes from Red Cross cartons...and knife as canopener...all outlets prompted by necessity.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was captured as a POW after a bombing raid in Germany during World War II. Rations at Stalag Luft III were poor, but they were subsidized by Red Cross packages, which included cigarettes, chocolate bars, and canned food, including raisins, tuna, corned beef, sugar, jam, Spam, prunes, crackers, powdered coffee, liver pate, and condensed milk. The men were sometimes able to find creative ways to prepare the food. They were also able to adapt everyday objects to create necessary tools.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary from World War II includes a drawing of a group of prisoners who are passing time by playing cards. They are sitting next to a heating stove that, according to Mitchener, has a six-foot radius. He writes,&quot;There's at least one 'Ladies Aid' per room - -  Underneath the drawing he explains that the men are playing bridge, staving off hunger, and using a small amount of coal to keep warm. They are actually using wood stumps as a substitute for coal.</dc:description>

Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks called blocks, a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, and a theater and a chapel building. The winters in Silesia were quite cold, and a chilly wind penetrated the cracks in the walls. The men were frequently cold and uncomfortable. Usually bored, they attempted to pass time by playing cards.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III, which was located in Zagan, Poland (at the time, a part of Germany). The men were aware of the progress of Stalin's forces through radio broadcasts, underground newspapers, and newly arrived prisoners. Stalin initiated the Red Army's winter offensive on the morning of January 12, 1945. They arrived in Silesia eight days later, thus depriving the Germans of a rich source of coal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary shows the barracks as they appeared on January 27, 1945, after a rapid evacuation of the POW camp. The picture shows the interior of a room with everything in disarray. He writes,&quot;As result [sic] on a cold Sat. P.M. ---Evacuation---Yes! the same Room 5 which we so covetously scrubbed and cleaned... As recently as Friday last the 'weekly scrub' was contemplated - but only contemplated! Now we leave confusion in confusion; 'Uncle Joe' presses hard from the East.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. On the night of January 27, 1945, some of the men at Stalag Luft III were watching a Kriegie show, a Broadway comedy. One of the senior officers announced, &quot;The goons have...given us 30 minutes to be at the front gate. Get your stuff together and line up.&quot; Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps (including Stalag Luft III) that were about to be liberated by the Red Army.</dc:description>

Mitchener writes,&quot;About thirteen hours later &amp; 29 km. -- 'Resting a Bit' - In the hamlet of Freiwaldau, the caravan halted for 5 hours. No shelter provided, the Krieges sought their own. A driving blizzard outside - in surroundings as above yours truly warmed, ate EGGS &amp; HAM w/special attention of true German hospitality - A truly good and pleasant woman.

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW in May 1944 after a bombing mission in Germany. By early January 1945, the Red Army was getting nearer and nearer to Stalag Luft III, where Mitchener was imprisoned. Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps in Silesia when he realized that they were about to be liberated by the Red Army. The men marched west, and faced a terrible blizzard. At night, the prisoners slept at any housing they could locate, including civilian areas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was sent to the POW camp Stalag Luft III. Blank journals were given to soldiers through the War Prisoners Aid of the Young Men's Christian Association. In 1939, the World's Committee of the YMCA, which was headquartered in Geneva, established the War Prisoners Aid so that the recreational, educational, and spiritual needs of prisoners could be met. The International Red Cross Committee provided books for prisoners.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland.  Christmas Day in 1944 at Stalag Luft III was cold but clear. The men were given Red Cross parcels with canned turkey, cookies, and plum pudding. The Germans gave them party hats and noisemakers, but the atmosphere was still grim. The Western troops were stalled along the Siegfried Line, and the men feared that they would be prisoners indefinitely.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was sent to the POW camp Stalag Luft III. Blank journals were given to soldiers through the War Prisoners Aid of the Young Men's Christian Association. In 1939, the World's Committee of the YMCA, which was headquartered in Geneva, established the War Prisoners Aid so that the recreational, educational, and spiritual needs of prisoners could be met. The International Red Cross Committee provided books for prisoners.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This item, a shipping or mailing label, has been taped in Mitchener's diary. It indicates that a package was sent to Mitchener from his mother, Estelle F. Mitchener, of Nashville, Tennessee. The label has a stamp from a U. S. Censor. In his diary Mitchener has noted, &quot;The First Package from Home.&quot;</dc:description>
<dc:coverage>Zagan (Poland)</dc:coverage>
<dc:date>1944-1945</dc:date>
<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland. Mail for prisoners was greatly delayed, as it had to pass through American censors. Mitchener's mother, Estelle Mitchener, was living in Nashville, Tennessee, when she sent her son a package of unknown contents. Estelle, who died in 1967, lived longer than her son, who died in America in 1957. Mitchener's father also outlived him, and died in 1964.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured as a POW in Germany after a bombing raid during World War II.  He was sent to Stalag Luft III, the prison camp made famous by the failed &quot;Great Escape&quot; that took place before Mitchener arrived. In order to fight boredom, depression, and uncomfortable living conditions, the men at the camp devised recreational activities such as music and theatre. They were provided with YMCA instruments, and established orchestras with names such as the &quot;Sagan Serenaders.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:date>1944-1945</dc:date>
<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany. The men kept abreast of Allied progress through radio broadcasts, newly arrived prisoners, and underground newspapers. Radio parts could be obtained through bribing German guards. The prisoners were sometimes able to obtain coveted goods such as cigarettes and chocolate through their Red Cross parcels. These items could be used for exchange on the black market.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>World War, 1939-1945 -- Europe; Prisoners of war; Diaries</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This page is a poem,&quot;Prisoner's Prayer.&quot; Mitchener notes that it was memorized by a POW from scratchings on the wall in a Vienna transition camp. The poem asks for God's protection for airmen facing &quot;shell, flak, fire, and foe.&quot; He writes, in part, &quot;Lord, guard and guide the men who fly/Thru the great spaces of the sky/Protect them as they take to air/In morning light and sunshine fair.&quot;</dc:description>

He served as a second Lieutenant in the 509th Bombardment Squadron, 351st Bombardment Group, 8th Air Force. After men were captured, they were often told, &quot;For you, the war is over,&quot; and this served to demoralize the men. Men who were kept as POWs often suffered from depression during their internment. This was referred to as &quot;barbed wire disease.&quot; The men longed for freedom.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This image was drawn by Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. in the diary that he received during his stay at a German prisoner of war camp. It pictures an airman, probably Mitchener himself, falling out of the sky in a parachute. His plane has been shot down, and a fire is visible in the background where his plane has crashed. Two signs are pictured, one which reads, &quot;Welcome to Sagan, City of 2000 Dreams,&quot; and the other reads, &quot;To Dulag Registration Center.&quot; Mitchener is about to be taken prisoner.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This page is a poem, &quot;Bars, Inc.&quot; written by &quot;Coyle&quot; and dedicated to &quot;Ivan - POW El Grande.&quot; The poem or song is about having a bar in every room of the house. Mitchener has drawn a small picture of a bar with a sign &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; next to it. The closing stanza reads,&quot;Now I'll have a piano and maybe a stove/But the bars will have to come first/A roof over my head enough food to buy/But I'll damn' well not die of thirst!&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. After the men were captured, they were often told, &quot;For you, the war is over,&quot; and this served to demoralize the men. Men who were kept as POWs often suffered from depression during their internment. This was often referred to as &quot;barbed wire disease.&quot; The men could occasionally create a brew at the camp by using raisins, prunes, and sugar.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland. Christmas Day in 1944 at Stalag Luft III was cold but clear. The men were given Red Cross parcels with canned turkey, cookies, and plum pudding. The Germans gave them party hats and noisemakers, but the atmosphere was still grim. The Allied troops were stalled along the Siegfried Line, and the men feared that they would be prisoners indefinitely.</dc:description>
