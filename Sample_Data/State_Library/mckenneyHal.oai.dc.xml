<dc:description>The creation of the Cherokee alphabet has historically been attributed to Sequoyah (aka George Guess) in the early 1820s.  The syllabary consisted of eighty-six symbols representing seventy-nine consonant-vowel combinations, six vowels, and the consonant; /s/. While the alphabet seemingly symbolized an adoption of white civilization, it also indicated a preservation of Cherokee culture through the use of the syllabary.</dc:description>
