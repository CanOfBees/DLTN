<dc:title>Emanuel Dupree</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Fayette County resident Emanuel Dupree recorded as part of the Tennessee State Park Folklife Project.  Dupree, a third generation white oak basket maker and chair bottomer, describes the processes and how he learned.  This African American woodcrafter also relates performing in local fife and drum bands and the accompanying celebrations.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets.  His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Porter Linder Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Fentress County resident Porter Linder recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project. Tales of Stearns Logging illustrate the commercial logging that came to the Big South Fork area between 1900 and 1920. The logging camps, logging trains, and large-scale operations of Michigan-based Stearns Coal and Lumber Company are conveyed.  Linder speaks of the tragic 1933 lumber camp shooting sparked by Jerome Boyatt that rocked the Big South Fork area and resulted in five deaths.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Linder's contribution illustrates the impact commercial lumber and coal ventures of northern investors had on areas like Scott, Pickett, and Fentress Counties.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Audio files of Chester County's Oak Grove Acapella Singers performing recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.

<dc:title>Dick Huddleston Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Wilson County resident Dick Huddleston's oral history recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project. Huddleston, a Cedars of Lebanon 39-year park employee, farmer, and resident of the area, describes many farms and businesses that existed before the establishment of Cedars of Lebanon State Park.

<dc:title>Joseph Ernest Dyer Part 2</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Henderson County resident Joseph Ernest Dyer recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Dyer supplies details of his personal history, his musical influences and his performances.  He relates learning how to play the guitar and harmonica. He discusses the techniques used in fiddle making and woodcraft.  Dyer provides guitar performances of old time, blues, country, and religious music.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks. From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Johnson Swafford Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Bledsoe County resident Johnson Swafford describes homemade instruments such as hide and cheese box banjos, gourd fiddles, and the mouth bow.  Swafford makes banjos, fiddles, dulcimers, and mandolins, and he relates his processes. Swafford remembers shape-note singing schools in the area, where songs were sung a cappella, and the schools would end with a revival.  He talks of candy pulls, ice cream socials, buck dancing, square dancing, and logging activities that fostered community spirit.</dc:description>
<dc:description>&quot;Old-Time&quot; Baptists brought traditions of lined a cappella singing with them into northeastern Tennessee.  Eighteenth century northern ministers with their &quot;Singing School Movement of New England&quot; spawned the shape-note type singing that appeared in Tennessee. This combination of text, the use of shapes for musical notation, and the voicing of a song's notation prior to singing it was promoted by the increased availability of four-shape-note songbooks.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Clay Childers Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of McNairy County resident Clay Childers recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Childers relates his family history and stories of the family farm.  He touches on moonshining and Civil War stories of the Battle of Shiloh.  He describes fashioning chairs and musical instruments and building log cabins.  He plays guitar and performs religious, old time, and country music selections.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Childers's contribution conveys McNairy County social and agricultural history.  His tales of barn raisings and log cabin building reflect aspects of McNairy County folk architecture.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases in Tennessee's state parks, folklorists conducted summer interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Clay Childers Part 3</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of McNairy County resident Clay Childers recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Childers relates his family history and stories of the family farm.  He touches on moonshining and Civil War stories of the Battle of Shiloh.  He describes fashioning chairs and musical instruments and building log cabins.  He plays guitar and performs religious, old time, and country music selections.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Childers's contribution conveys McNairy County social and agricultural history.  His tales of barn raisings and log cabin building reflect aspects of McNairy County folk architecture.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases in Tennessee's state parks, folklorists conducted summer interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>James Caldwell</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Hardin County resident Jim Caldwell recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Caldwell conveys stories of his personal and family history.  He describes the methods of one of his occupations, water-witching or dousing using a divining rod.  Caldwell also provides an account of digging and repairing wells.  He relates tales of healing warts and thrash, horse trading, and moonshining.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee folk custom of dousing has ancient origins and accompanying controversy. Dousing references are said to exist in Tassili cave art, Egyptian engravings, Chinese etchings, and Biblical passages. The practice would spread across Europe, and a forked stick, wand, pendulum, or metal rod would be utilized to locate water, mineral ore, and information beyond logical reason.  Dousing also carries with it a connection to healing, as demonstrated by Caldwell's contribution.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Linnie Johnson and Jesse Robinson Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of White County neighbors Linnie Johnson and Jesse Robinson, both born in Dekalb County, recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Johnson performs unaccompanied ballads and old time music, and there are discussions concerning the backgrounds of the songs.  Together, they relay tales of ghosts, haints, hangings, and murders.  Anecdotes concerning the Ku Klux Klan and Night Riders are included.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The contributions of Johnson and Robinson convey both musical and social history of the Upper Cumberland area.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Images of Claude Chessor playing dulcimer on his front porch in Lyles, Tennessee.  Dickson County resident Claude Chessor, born in Hickman County, discusses dulcimer making, dulcimer design, and dulcimer playing with folklorists from the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project. He performs examples of ballads, old time music, country music and religious music on different types of dulcimers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Chessor's contribution illustrates the expert craftsmanship required to design and handmake cypress-top, spruce-top, and cherry dulcimers.  He also provides the listener with variety of sound, as he plays music on these different kinds of heritage instruments.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases in state parks, folklorists conducted interviews, took photos, and recorded music.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Emanuel (Manny) Dupree making baskets</dc:title>
<dc:description>Fayette County resident Emanuel Dupree is seated amidst his basket making supplies, holding rolled up white oak splits, and working on a split white oak basket at his home five miles south of Somerville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Emanuel Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets. His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Workyard tools</dc:title>
<dc:description>Images of chair caning supplies, tools, and the workyard used by Emanuel Dupree. Dupree, a third generation white oak basket maker and chair bottomer or caner, describes in his contributions to the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project the processes and how he learned. This African American woodcrafter also relates performing in local fife and drum bands and the accompanying celebrations.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets.  His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Dulcimer</dc:title>
<dc:description>Front of dulcimers pictured as a group. These cypress-top, spruce-top, and cherry dulcimers were crafted by Dickson County resident Claude Chessor. Chessor was born in Hickman County,</dc:description>
<dc:description>Chessor's contribution illustrates the expert craftsmanship required to design and handmake dulcimers and provides a body of materials dealing with dulcimer making, dulcimer design, and dulcimer playing. The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer folklorists stationed in Tennessee's state parks conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>

The company involved would then, probably be Stearns Coal and Lumber Company.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Linder's contribution illustrates the impact commercial lumber and coal ventures of northern investors had on areas like Scott, Pickett, and Fentress Counties.

Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.

His woodcraft gained national prominence, and advertisements for his walking sticks appeared in New York Magazine as early as the 1970s.

<dc:description>Red and white Star of the East variation quilt, hanging on a clothes line.  The quilt belonged to Belle and Clyde Williams, a brother and sister from Watertown, Tennessee. [Belle Williams] may be seen, seated in a lawn chair, to the right of the quilt.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The star design has played a prominent role in quilt patterns since the early 1800s, with the most common being the Bethlehem Star or Lone Star pattern.  The Bethlehem Star pattern features a large central star made up of many small diamonds of; fabric.  The fabric is usually multi-colored, giving the star a kaleidoscope effect.  Around the time of the Civil War, a pattern known as the Ohio Star became popular. Most stars in quilt patterns have four, six, or eight rays.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Honeycomb pattern is a traditional one-patch quilt pattern made up of hexagon shaped pieces. Hexagon quilts (like the Honeycomb, Mosaic, and Grandmother's Flower Garden) are usually very time consuming and labor intensive to make with all the pieces being stitched together by hand, typically using a method of construction known as English Paper Piecing. In the English Paper Piecing technique, a paper template is used to back the fabric pieces in order to help sew complex angles together accurately.</dc:description>

<dc:description>While there is much myth surrounding the origins of the Double Wedding Ring pattern, its earliest known publication was in 1928 in Capper's Weekly, a newspaper published by Arthur Capper in Topeka, Kansas. According to folk tradition, if a couple; received this quilt as a gift and slept under it, their marriage would be long and happy. Another bit of folklore implies that if a single girl makes a Double Wedding Ring and gives it to the gentleman of her choosing he will soon be her husband.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Log cabin quilt</dc:title>
<dc:description>Log Cabin pattern quilt, hanging on a clothes line. Log Cabin blocks can be placed in different configurations to make overall designs.  The Log Cabin blocks in this quilt have been placed in a design commonly referred to as Streak of Lightning.</dc:description>
<dc:description>While English examples of the Log Cabin quilt pattern are known to exist dating back to the 1830s, it did not become popular in America until around the time of the Civil War. Traditionally, the center of each block represents the hearth of the cabin; and would be made with a red piece of fabric to resemble fire. Each log is then added around the hearth, overlapping the one before, until the cabin is built. Light and dark colors are alternated to represent life containing both joy and sorrow.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Wheelbarrow with metal wheel</dc:title>
<dc:description>Rustic handmade wooden wheelbarrow with a metal wheel used by Emanuel  Dupree in his workyard is pictured. Dupree, a third generation white oak basket maker and chair bottomer or caner, describes in his contributions to the project the processes and how he learned. This African American woodcrafter also relates performing in local fife and drum bands and the accompanying celebrations.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets.  His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Split white oak basket</dc:title>
<dc:description>Split white oak basket made by Mr. Emmanuuel Dupree</dc:description>
<dc:description>Emanuel Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets. His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Oak Grove Church of Christ Gospel Group Chester County</dc:title>
<dc:description>Oak Grove Acapella Singers of Chester County being recorded while singing in the office of the preacher at the Oak Grove Church of Christ. Fifteen members comprise this unaccompanied African American religious musical group centered around the Oak Grove Church of Christ of Jacks Creek, Tennessee.  Gospel songs feature solos by several of the members.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The contribution of the Oak Grove Acapella Singers conveys the power of African American gospel and the rich tradition of a capella singing within the Church of Christ.  The Tennessee State Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photos, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
