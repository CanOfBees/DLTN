<dc:description>An Act for the Establishment of Washington College 
An act for the establishment of Washington College in honor to the illustrious President of the United States at Salem in Washington county. 
Whereas the Legislature of North Carolina, established the academy in Washington county, by the name of Martin academy, which has continued for ten or twelve years past under the presidency of the reverend Samuel Douk, and has been of considerable utility to the public, and affords a prospect of future usefulness if invested with powers and privileges appertaining to Colleges: 
Sec 1. Be it enacted by the Governor, Legislative Council, and House of Representatives of the Territory of the United States of America south of the river Ohio, That the reverend Samuel Doak president, the reverend Charles Cummins, Edward Crawford, John Coson, James Balch, Robert Henderson and Gideon Blackburn, Judge Joseph Anderson, General John Sevier, Colonels Landon Carter and Daniel Kenedy, Majors Leeroy Taylor and John Sevier, John Tipton, William Cocke, Archibald</dc:description>
<dc:description>&quot;An act for the establishment of Washington College in honor to the Illustrious President of the United States at Salem in Washington County.&quot; The act is handwritten and is five pages in length.  The resolution passed at Knoxville on July 10, 1795.  It is signed by Governor William Blount. 
 The act renaming re-naming St. Martin’s Academy to Washington College in honor of President George Washington was one of the varied acts passed by the Southwest Territory General Assembly. Samuel Doak (1749-1830), a Virginia Presbyterian minister and pioneer, assumed his first pastorate in Abingdon, Virginia, and also began to &quot;ride circuit&quot; in eastern Tennessee. In 1778 he settled in Tennessee in Sullivan County and was ordained a minister. In 1780 he moved to Washington County, where he formed Salem Church and a school, which was chartered as St. Martin's Academy in 1783, the first chartered school in the region. In 1795 it became Washington College. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33669_Intro.pdf</dc:description>

<dc:description>Circular to members of the General Assembly. 
Knoxville 4th July 1796. 
Sir 
I have received information from the Honorable Messrs. Blount and Cocke; That Tennessee is by and act of Congress admitted as a member State of the Union. 
By this act we are only entitled to the privilege of having one Representative; The Senate of the United States objected against our Senators taking seats within their body. 
Matters being thus deranged, it becomes expedient and necessary, for the Assembly to be convened at an early day, in order to alter and regulate our present mode of election for Representatives, Electors of President and Vice President of the United States, reelect Senators and other business of Public utility. 
Your punctual attendance at the seat of Government, on the last saturday in the present month will be expected. 
I have the honor to be respectfully 
Your most obedient humble servant 
(signed)</dc:description>

At this time, he also summons the members to attend the first session of the General Assembly.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Journal of a Voyage, intended by God's Permission, in the good Boat Adventure, from Fort Patrick Henry on Holston river to the French Salt-Springs on Cumberland River, kept by John Donaldson 
Decm. 22. 1779 Took our Departure from the Fort and fell down the river to the mouth of Reedy Creek, where we were stopped by the fall of water. and most excessive hard frost: and after much delay and many difficulties we arrived at the Mouth of Cloud's Creek, on Sunday evening the 20th Febry. 1780, where we lay by until Sunday 27th when we took our departure with sundry other vessels bound for the same voyage, and on the same day struck the Poor-Valley-Shoal, together with Mr. Boyd and Mr. Rounsifer, on which shoal we lay that afternoon &amp; succeeding night in much distress. 
Monday, Febry. 28th 1780 In the morning, the water rising, we got off the shoal, after landing thirty persons to lighten our boat. In attempting to land on an island, received some damage and lost sundry articles, and came to camp on the south shore, where we joined sundry other vessels also bound down. 
Tuesday Proceeded down the river [and] camped on the north Shore, [the afternoon and] following [day proving rainy.]</dc:description>

<dc:description>Wednesday March 1st. Proceeded on and camped on the south shore, nothing happening that day remarkable. 
Thursday March 2nd. Rain about half the day, passed the mouth of French Broad River: and about 12 O.'clock, Mr. Henry's boat being driven on the point of an island by the force of the current was sunk, The crew’s lives much endangered, the whole cargo much damaged, which occasioned the whole fleet to put on shore and go to their assistance; but with much difficulty bailed her out &amp; raised her, in order to take in her cargo again. The same afternoon Reuben Harrison went out a hunting and did not return that night, though many guns were fired to fetch him in. 
Friday 3rd. Early in the morning fired a four pounder for the lost man, sent out sundry persons to search the woods for him, firing many guns that day and the succeeding night, but all without success, to the great grief of his parents and fellow travelers [i.e. travelers]. “Vale! Vale!” 
Saturday 4th. Proceed on our voyage, leaving old Mr. Harrison, with some other vessels to make further search for his lost son;</dc:description>

Tuesday, 7th.          Got under way very early, the day proving very windy, a S.S.W. &amp; the river being wide occasioned a high sea, insomuch, that some of the smaller crafts were in danger, therefore came to at the uppermost Chiccamauga Town, which was then evacuated, where we lay by that afternoon and camped that night. The wife of Ephraim Peyton was here delivered of a child. Mr. Peyton has gone through by land with Capt. Robertson.

Wednesday 8th.      Castoff at 10 O.'clock. &amp; proceed down to an Indian village, which was inhabited, on the south side of the river, they invited on us to &quot;come ashore”, called us brothers, &amp; showed other signs of Friendship, insomuch, that Mr. John Caffery &amp; my son then on board took a canoe which I had in tow &amp; were crossing over to them; the rest of the fleet having landed on the opposite shore. After they had gone some distance, a half-Breed who called himself Archy Coody with several other Indians jumped into a canoe, met them, and advised them to return to the boat,

After distributing some presents among them, with which they seemed much pleased, we observed a number of Indians on the other side embarking in their canoes, armed and painted red &amp; black. Coody immediately made signs to his companions, ordering them to quit the boat, which they did, himself and another Indian remaining with us &amp; telling us to move off instantly. We had not gone far before we discovered a number of Indians armed and painted proceeding down the river, as it were, to intercept us. Coody the half breed &amp; his companion sailed with us for some time, &amp; telling us that we had passed all the Towns &amp; were out of danger, left us. But we had not gone far until we had come in sight of another Town situated likewise on the south side of the river, nearly opposite a small island. Here they again invited us to come on shore, called us brothers, &amp; observing the boats standing off for the opposite channel told us that &quot;their side of the river was better for boats to pass.&quot; And here we must regret the unfortunate death of young Mr. Payne on board Capt. Blackemores boat, who was mortally wounded by reason of the boat running too near the northern shore opposite the town where some of the enemy lay concealed, &amp; the more</dc:description>

<dc:description>tragical misfortune of poor Stuart, his family and friends to the number of twenty eight persons. This man had embarked with us for the western country, but his family being diseased with the small-pox, it was agreed upon between him &amp; the Company, that he should keep at some distance in the rear, for fear of the infection spreading: and he was warned each night when the encampment should take place by the sound of a horn. After we had passed the Town, the Indians, having now collected to a considerable number, observing his helpless situation, singled off from the rest of the fleet, intercepted him &amp; killed &amp; took prisoners the whole crew, to the great grief of the whole Company uncertain how soon they might share the same fate; their cries were distinctly heard by those boats in the rear. 
We still perceived them marching down the river in considerable bodies, keeping pace with us until the Cumberland mountain withdrew them from our sight, when we were in hopes we had escaped them. ____ We were now arrived at the place called the Whirl or Suck, where the river is compressed within less than half its common width above, by the Cumberland mountain, which juts in on both sides. In passing through the upper part of these narrows, at a place described by Coody, which he termed the &quot;boiling Pot;” a trivial accident had nearly ruined the expedition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>One of the Company, (John Cotton) who was moving down in a large canoe, had attached it to Robert Cartwright's boat, into which he and his family had gone for safety. The canoe was here overturned &amp; the little cargo lost. The Company pitying his distress concluded to halt &amp; assist him in recovering his property. They had landed on the northern shore at a level spot &amp; were going up to the place, when the Indians to our astonishment appeared immediately over us on the opposite Cliffs &amp; commenced firing down upon us, which occasioned a precipitate retreat to the boats. We immediately moved off, the Indians lining the Bluffs along continued their fire from the heights on our boats below, without doing any other injury than wounding four slightly. Jennings's boat is missing. 
We have now passed through the whirl. The river widens with a placid &amp; gentle current. And all of the Company appear to be in safety except the family of Jonathan Jennings, whose boat ran on a large rock projecting out from the northern shore and partly immersed in water immediately at the Whirl, where we were compelled to leave them perhaps to be slaughtered by their merciless enemies. 
Continued to sail on that day and floated throughout the following night.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Thursday 9th. Proceed on our journey, nothing happening worthy attention today, floated till about midnight, &amp; encamped on the northern shore. 
Friday 10th. This morning about 4 o'clk, [i.e. o’clock] we were surprised by the cries of &quot;help poor Jennings”; at some distance in the rear. He had discovered us by our fires, and came up in the most wretched condition. He states that as soon as the Indians discovered his situation they turned their whole attention to him &amp; kept up a most galling fire on his boat. He ordered his wife, a son nearly grown, a young man who accompanied them, &amp; his two negroes to throw all his goods into the river, to lighten their boat for the purpose of getting her off, himself returning their fire as well as he could (being a good soldier &amp; an excellent marksman). But before they had accomplished their object, his son, the young man &amp; the negro man jumped out of the boat &amp; left them. He thinks the young man &amp; the negro were wounded before they left the boat. Mrs. Jennings, however, &amp; the negro woman succeeded in unloading the boat, but chiefly by the exertions of Mrs. Jennings, who got out of the boat &amp; shoved her off, but was near falling a victim to her own intrepidity on account of the boat starting so suddenly, as soon as loosened from the rock. Upon examination he appears to have made a wonderful escape, for his boat is pierced in numberless places with bullets. It is to be remarked, that Mrs. Peyton, who</dc:description>

Their clothes were very much cut with bullets, especially Mrs. Jennings's. 
Saturday 11th. Got under way, after having distributed the family of Mr. Jennings in the other boats. Moved on quietly that day and encamped for the night on the north shore. 
Sunday 12th. Set out and after a few hours sailing we heard the crowing of cocks, &amp; soon came within view of the Town, here they fired on us again without doing any injury. 
After running until about 10. o'clk. [i.e. o’clock] came in sight of the Muscle Shoals. Halted on the northern shore at the appearance of the shoals in order to search for the signs Capt. James Robertson was to make for us at that place. He set out from Holston early in the fall of 1779, was to proceed by the way of Kentucky to the Big Salt Lick on Cumberland river; with several others in company was to come across from the big Salt Lick to the upper end of the Shoals, there to make such signs that we might know he had been there, &amp; that it was practicable for us to go across by land. But to our great mortification</dc:description>

<dc:description>we can find none. From which we conclude that it would not be prudent to make the attempt, and are determined, knowing ourselves to be in such imminent danger, to pursue our journey down the river. After trimming our boats in the best manner possible we ran through the shoals before night. When we approached them they had a dreadful appearance to those who had never seen them before. The water being high made a terrible roaring, which could be heard at some distance, among the drift-wood heaped frightfully upon the points of the islands; the current running in every possible direction. Here we did not know how soon we should be dashed to pieces and all our troubles ended at once. Our boats frequently dragged on the bottom. And appeared constantly in danger of striking. They warped as much as in a rough sea. But by the hand of Providence we are now preserved from this danger also. I know not the length of this wonderful shoal; it had been represented to me to be 25 or 30 miles: If so, we must have descended very rapidly, as indeed we did, for we passed it in about three hours. Came to &amp; camped on the northern shore, not far below the Shoals, for the night. 
Monday 13th. Got under way early in the morning and made a good run on that day. 
Tuesday 14th. Set out early. On this day two boats approaching too</dc:description>

<dc:description>near the shore were fired on by the Indians. Five of the crews were wounded but not dangerously. Came to camp at night near the mouth of a creek. After kindling fires and preparing for rest, the company were alarmed, on account of the incessant barking our dogs kept up, taking it for granted that the Indians were attempting to surprise us, retreated precipitately to the boats, fell down the river about a mile, &amp; encamped on the other shore. In the morning I prevailed on Mr. Caffrey &amp; my son to cross below in a canoe, and return to the place; which they did, &amp; found an African negro, we had left in the hurry, asleep by one of the fires. The Voyagers returned &amp; collected their utensils, which had been left. 
Wednesday 15th. Got underway &amp; moved on peaceably the five following days, when we arrived at the mouth of the Tennessee, on Monday 20th. &amp; landed on the lower point immediately on the bank of the Ohio. Our situation here is truly disagreeable. The river is very high and the current rapid. Our boats not constructed for the purpose of stemming a rapid stream. Our provision exhausted.

Amongst the rest my son in law &amp; daughter. We now part, perhaps to meet no more, for I am determined to pursue my course, happen what will. 
Tuesday 21st. Set out &amp; on this day laboured very hard &amp; got but a little way. Camped on the south bank of the Ohio. Passed the two following days as the former suffering much from hunger &amp; fatigue. 
Friday 24th. About 3 O'clk. [i.e. o’clock] came to the mouth of a river which I thought was the Cumberland. Some of the Company declared it could not be, it was so much smaller than was expected: But I never heard of any river running in between the Cumberland &amp; Tennessee. It appeared to flow with a gentle current. We determined however to make the trial Pushed up some distance &amp; encamped for the night. 
Saturday 25th. Today we are much encouraged. The river grows wider. The current is very gentle. And we are now convinced it is the Cumberland. I have derived great assistance from a small square sail which was fixed up on the day we left the mouth of the river. And to prevent any ill effects from sudden flaws of wind, a man was sta-tioned at each of the lower corners of the sheet with directions to give way whenever it was necessary. 
Sunday 26th. Got under way early. procured some buffalo-meat.</dc:description>

Proceeded on quietly until the 12th of April, at which time we came to the mouth of a little river running on the north side, by Moses Renfoe &amp; his company called Red River, up which they intend to settle. Here they took leave of us. We proceeded up Cumberland; nothing happening material until the 23rd, when we reached the first settlement on north side of the river, one mile &amp; half below the Big Salt Lick, and called Eaton's station after a man of that name, who with several other families came through Kentucky &amp; settled there. 
Monday April 24th. 1780. This day we arrived at our journey's end at the Big Salt Lick. Where we have the pleasure of finding Capt. Robertson &amp; his Company. It is a source of satisfaction to us to be enabled to restore to him &amp; others their families &amp; friends, who were entrusted to our care, and who, some time since, perhaps despaired of ever meeting again. Tho our prospects at present are dreary. We have found a few log cabins which have been built on a Cedar Bluff above the Lick. by Capt. Robertson and his company.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Donelson Journal</dc:title>
<dc:description>Journal documenting the 1779-1780 river voyage of Col. John Donelson and others, including women, children, and African Americans. The travelers sought to establish the first permanent settlement west of the Appalachians. Handwritten in ink on paper.  The Donelson Journal has long been of special interest to those who study Tennessee history, as it purports to be a firsthand account of a planned river journey to found the first permanent settlement to the west of the Appalachians - 200 miles further west than previous settlements. The authenticity of the journal has recently been called into question, and may actually have been written long after the actual trip to Nashville. The document proclaims to be the “Journal of a voyage intended by God’s permission in the good boat Adventure from Fort Patrick Henry on Holston River to the French Salt Springs on Cumberland River, kept by John DONELSON,” but a recent article in the Tennessee Historical Quarterly by Paul Clements argues that it is much more likely that the journal was written by Donelson’s son. 
The journey down the river was dangerous and involved tense encounters with Native Americans, physical dangers, inclement weather, and other hazards. Numerous casualties occurred during the journey, including the death of a young baby that was lost overboard during an altercation with Native Americans. Food was scarce, but the group survived by hunting animals, usually buffalo, and on one occasion, a swan, which was deemed “very delicious.” The travelers frequently interacted with Native Americans, some of whom were friendly and others who were hostile. They even worked with a so-called “half-breed” (part Indian, part white) named Archy Coody who guided them (and led them into an ambush) during a portion of their journey. The best scholarly interpretation of their journey was written in 1960 by Harriette Simpson Arnow in her book Seedtime on the Cumberland. In it she considers the inexperienced leadership of Donelson and Robertson and the many misfortunes that befell them during the trip. Arnow asserts that those who made the trip overland at the same time “actually did the hard and ugly work” of establishing a permanent settlement in Middle Tennessee, although the story of the dramatic river journey has long captured the imagination of those who have come across the Donelson Journal.

<dc:description>This journal documents the 1779-1780 river voyage of Col. John Donelson and others, including women, children, and African Americans. The travelers were seeking to establish the first permanent settlement to the west of the Appalachians - 200 miles further west than previous settlements. On December 22, 1779, Col. John Donelson’s group departed on the boat Adventure from Fort Patrick Henry on the Holston River. After many harrowing adventures and considerable suffering, they arrived at French Lick, which is now Nashville, Tennessee. Donelson’s crew included many family members of the men who took a different route west with James Robertson. This group joined Donelson’s flotilla at the mouth of the Clinch River, and was led by Capt. John Blackmore. Upon arriving at the French Lick and joining Robertson’s group, a forted station was constructed next to the Cumberland River. The successful completion of this voyage in April 1780 culminated in the founding of the settlement of Nashborough (later Nashville).  The document purports to be a firsthand account of this journey, but the authenticity of the item has recently been called into question. Although the diary prominently displays the words, “the original” on the front, it is possible that the author of the journal is not John Donelson himself, but rather, his son, John Donelson, Jr. A detailed investigation of this possibility can be found in: Paul Clements, “Tennessee Notes: An Analysis of ‘The Original’ Donelson Journal and Associated Accounts of the Donelson Party Voyage.” Tennessee Historical Quarterly 64, no. 4 (Winter 2005): 338-349. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33635_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

Section 2nd   That government being instituted for the common benefit, the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of Mankind.
of the good and happiness of Mankind.

3rd  That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case, whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; And that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

Sec. 4. That no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this State.

Sec. 5. That elections shall be free and equal.

Sec. 6. That the right of trial by Jury shall remain inviolate.

Sec. 7. That the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions, from unreasonable searches and seizures; and that general warrants, whereby an officer may be commanded to search suspected places, without evidence of the fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, whose offences are not particularly described and supported by evidence, are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be granted.

Sec. 8. That no free man shall be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.

But in prosecutions for the publication of papers, investigating the official conduct of officers or men in public capacity, the truth thereof may be given in evidence; and in all indictments for libels, the jury shall have a right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the Court, as in other criminal cases.

admit; and that in all cases the military shall be Kept in strict subordination to the civil authority.

Sec. 25. That no citizen of this State, except such as are employed in the Army of the United States, or Militia in actual service, shall be subjected to corporeal punishment under the martial law.

Sec. 26. That the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and to bear arms for their common defence [i.e. defense].

Sec. 29. That an equal participation of the free navigation of the Mississippi is one of the inherent rights of the citizens of this State: it cannot, therefore, be conceded to any prince, potentate, power, person or persons whatever.

<dc:title>Tennessee Constitution, 1834</dc:title>
<dc:description>This first revision of the Tennessee Constitution addressed a variety of problems present in the original 1796 Constitution. Pages are handwritten on oversize paper and are laminated.  In the period between 1796 and 1834, the population of Tennessee grew at large percentage. In 1800, Tennessee’s population was 105,602, and by 1830, the population had grown to 681,904. By 1830, Tennessee could no longer be considered the frontier. Tennessee had an urban population of over 5,000. The Constitution that governed those first Tennesseans, a few thousand rural settlers, was now becoming stressed trying to govern a population reaching nearly 700,000.

<dc:type>Text</dc:type>
<dc:description>In the first half of the nineteenth century a number of states, responding to social forces pressing the case for a greater role for the average white citizen, revised their constitutions. Tennessee became part of this trend when, on May 19, 1834, sixty delegates assembled in Nashville in a constitutional convention and selected William Carter of Carter County as president of the proceedings. The principal interests of the delegates concerned the provisions of the 1796 constitution dealing with taxation and representation. White citizens received greater opportunities for political expression and office holding. However, the newfound concern with the &quot;common man&quot; extended to whites only. In making suffrage changes, the delegates restricted the vote to white men, thereby disfranchising free black males, who had voted under the 1796 Constitution. A variety of other issues were addressed. Antislavery groups petitioned for the abolition of slavery, but the delegates rejected their appeals. Instead, the convention added language requiring the approval of slave owners for the passage of any future acts of emancipation. When presented to the voters in March 1835, the new constitution was ratified by a vote of 42,666 in favor to 17,691 against.

<dc:title>Tennessee Constitution, 1796</dc:title>
<dc:description>Tennessee's first constitution, adopted in 1796. Handwritten in ink on paper.  The 1796 Tennessee Constitution was drafted in Knoxville over a four week period by a convention of fifty-five delegates (two delegates from each of the territory’s eleven counties).  These delegates included William Blount (president of the convention), James Robertson, William Cocke, and Andrew Jackson.  Although John Sevier did not participate directly in the proceedings, he did work behind the scenes to promote Blount’s position.  The convention delegates never intended to present the Constitution to the citizens for ratification.  Instead, the delegates hurried to finish the Constitution in order to present a copy to Congress before their spring adjournment.  After much contention, a compromise was reached giving Tennessee immediate statehood on the condition of having only one representative in the House.  The bill was signed by President Washington on June 1, 1796.

The 1796 Constitution’s declarations on rights, taxation, and legislative authority were drawn largely from the North Carolina and Pennsylvania constitutions.  The Declaration of Rights and the position on suffrage differentiate Tennessee’s constitution from others of its time.  According to historian J.G.M. Ramsey, Thomas Jefferson described Tennessee’s as the “least imperfect and most republican of the state constitutions.”  Article III, Section 1st gives all freemen (white and black) twenty-one years of age who owned a freehold or who had resided in the county six months the right to vote.  There was also a provision giving men serving in the militia the right to elect their officers. </dc:description>

<dc:title>Watauga Purchase (Old Book A)</dc:title>
<dc:description>This volume comprises the first land grant book created for the area which became Tennessee.  Located at the front is the contract or treaty formalizing the land purchase between the Watauga Association and the Cherokee chiefs.  It is followed by the entry of the Watauga grants (generally individual tracts of 200-400 acres).  The remainder contains recorded Washington County grants issued by the State of North Carolina.  In the years prior to the American Revolution, settlers primarily from Virginia filtered down the Holston Valley to inhabit the fertile areas along the Watauga and Holston Rivers.  As Wataugans went about the business of settling their families, developing their lands, and co-existing with the Cherokees, they sowed the initial seeds of democracy and self-governance in the West and, specifically, the land that was to be Tennessee.

The Watauga settlers who gained a foothold in the area around 1769 occupied a tenuous position.  King George’s Proclamation of 1763 forbade settlement west of the Appalachian divide, and though it could be argued that two later treaties with the Cherokee nullified this order, the Wataugans’ status might still be considered that of squatter.  In addition, the Watauga inhabitants feared their settlement would become a haven for debtors and criminals.  Moses Fisk, a nineteenth-century historian, described them “as little protected, controlled, or recollected by any government whatever, as their co-tenants the bears.”  The order, justice, and security that a form of government would provide proved enticing.

Their rationale in place, and with John Carter as their chairman, the Wataugans formed the Watauga Association in May of 1772.  Though their actions may have been considered a temporary emergency resolution, with this endeavor and with their written Articles of Association, the settlers of Watauga drafted the inaugural constitution of civil government west of the Alleghanies, and formed what some have called the “first free and independent government in American.”

The text of the Articles of Association did not survive, but other documents, such as the Association’s later petition for annexation by North Carolina in 1776, provide insight into the operation of this self-government.  A magistrate’s court was formed with the consent of the people and was manned by five judges.  This body executed, by majority, judicial and legislative functions and carried out public business and land affairs. They adopted the laws of Virginia as the basis for their rulings.

<dc:description>With the Watauga Purchase on March 19, 1775, the Watauga Association arranged with the Cherokee chiefs to secure the land along the Watauga, Holston, and Great Conaway Rivers. This negotiation solidified the hold the settlers had on the area and further legitimized their burgeoning experiment in democracy and self-government.  This volume containing the treaty and recording the Watauga Purchase grants provides the earliest record of the Watauga settlement and proves to be the first land grant book created for the area which became Tennessee. The original ledger book kept by Trustee Charles Robertson was used to record the grants. James Smith served as Clerk for the Land Office opening in Watauga on April 1, 1775; the office was probably located at the residence of John Carter. This volume was transferred to Jonesborough with the formation of Washington County and used to record Washington County grants issued by the State of North Carolina.  The presence of a “copied by” notation in TSLA’s volume and its designation as “Old Book A” indicate that this book is most likely a copy of the original and that the original resides in the old land office papers held at the Archives in Raleigh, North Carolina. The volume housed at TSLA was furnished by Washington County for the Tennessee Historical Society exhibit at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897. The book remained with the Tennessee Historical Society, eventually coming into the custody of the Tennessee State Library and Archives.

This act, passed at the second session of the Southwest Territory General Assembly on July 11, 1795, called for the enumeration of all white male citizens in the territory. On November 28, 1795, the collected census reports from all eleven counties indicated that there were 77,262 inhabitants in the Southwest Territory, a total comfortably exceeding the minimum required for statehood (60,000). http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33668_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

<dc:title>Constitution of Cherokee Nation, 1827</dc:title>
<dc:description>23 pages handwritten in ink that comprise the Cherokee Constitution of 1827. This early copy may have been written by Sam Houston. It was found in the 1827 Tennessee legislative papers and may have been given to the State of Tennessee in exchange for copies of Tennessee documents.  The Cherokee Constitution of 1827 represents a milestone in modern Cherokee history.  The document was a continuation of Cherokee attempts to establish their nation as a sovereign entity.  Beginning in the early 1820s, with the completion of Sequoyah’s Cherokee Syllabary, almost total literacy was achieved among the Cherokees.  In 1822, a Cherokee Supreme Court was formed and the first written laws of the Western Cherokees were laid down two years later.  In 1825, New Echota, Georgia, became the authorized capital of the Cherokees.  With this background-a literate population, written laws, a Supreme Court, and a nation’s capital-the Cherokees were seemingly on the road to secure for themselves a permanent place within the boundaries of their southeastern homelands.  Through the language of the constitution, it was hoped that Americans would no longer view Cherokees as “savages” but “civilized” individuals capable of governing themselves without being policed by the United States government.  However, ultimate expulsion from their lands occurred only ten years after the adoption of the Cherokee Constitution.

<dc:description>A product of a convention held in early July 1827 at New Echota, Georgia, the constitution appears to be a version of the American Constitution adapted to suit Cherokee needs. Formulated mainly by the convention’s president, John Ross (1790-1866), the constitution does not represent a position of assimilation to white society but, rather, a conscious strategy to resist removal and maintain autonomy. Nevertheless, opposition to the constitution within the Cherokee nation was fierce. Traditionalists had long been concerned with laws passed by the Cherokee National Committee and Council that seemingly undermined old customs. To this faction, the Cherokee constitution seemed to be one more concession to white, Christian authority. Further opposition came in the form of vehement protests from state governments such as Georgia who insisted the document was an unconstitutional infringement on the state’s sovereign prerogatives regarding rule over Indian domains. For their part, John Ross and his followers saw the constitution as an attempt to maintain Cherokee autonomy in the midst of continued pressure from governments to remove the Cherokee from their homelands. An explanation of the political ramifications of the Cherokee Constitution of 1827 can be found in William G. McLoughlin, Cherokee Renascence in the New Republic (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1986), chapter 19. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33638_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

<dc:title>Tennessee Civil and Military Commission Book, Volume 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>This bound volume maintained by the Secretary of State represents the chronological recording of civil and military commissions issued by the Governor of Tennessee, John Sevier, from the beginning of statehood in 1796 to 1801.  The front section of the book includes those commissions that primarily reflect positions of state authority and is followed by commissions divided by county. The entries include the name of the individual, their commissioned position, and the date issued. The volume has no name.  
 The commission system that is represented by this volume recognizes individuals in the state who have been entrusted by the Governor with positions of military and civil authority. Appointments made by the state’s first governor John Sevier proved key as the former Territory of the United States of America South of the River Ohio adjusted to statehood and strove for stability. The positions that are recorded in this earliest volume are those that support the institutions of representative government, provide military security, and maintain order and structure within the fledgling state.

<dc:description>It is lastly agreed and firmly resolved that a dutiful and humble address or Petition be presented by some Person or Persons to be chosen by the Inhabitants to the General Assembly, giving the fullest assurance of the fidelity and attachment to the Interest of our Country and obedience to the Laws and constitution thereof; setting forth that we are confident our settlement is not within the boundaries of any nation or Tribe of Indians, as some of us know and all believe that they have fairly sold and received satisfaction for the land or Territories, whereon we reside and therefore we hope we may not be considered as acting against the Laws of our Country or the mandates of Government. 
That we do not desire to be exempt from the rateable share of the public expense of the present war or other contingent charges of Government. That we are from our remote situation utterly destitute of the benefit of the Laws of our Country, and exposed to the depredations of the Indians without any justifiable or effectual means of embodying our Militia or defending ourselves against the hostile attempts of our enemy- Praying and imploring the immediate aid and Protection of Government by erecting a county to include our settlements, appointing proper Officers for the discharge of public duty. Taking into consideration our distressed situation with respect to the Indians, and granting such relief and assistance as in wisdom, Justice and humanity may be thought reasonable.

<dc:title>Cumberland Compact</dc:title>
<dc:description>Original manuscript of the Cumberland Compact of Government, or Articles of Agreement, entered into by settlers on the Cumberland River, May 1, 1780, at what is now Nashville, and signed May 13, 1780 by 255 inhabitants of five stations on the river. First page missing; some following pages damaged, some quite significantly.  Handwritten in ink on paper.  One of the most important documents pertaining to the early history of the state of Tennessee is the Cumberland Compact. Richard Henderson, the representative for North Carolina on the western Virginia/North Carolina survey team, drew up the Cumberland Compact in May 1780 along with 250 other signatories. The Cumberland Compact called for a representative form of civil government by which the basis for courts, governance, and taxation were established. Each of the seven stations, or forts, of the Cumberland settlement was allowed a certain number of elected representatives to form a “Tribunal of Notables,” which included a total of twelve men. No voting qualifications were specified, but the Compact was open to all free white men who were willing to sign. This tribunal settled land claims and regulated the land office, in addition to receiving and dispersing funds and acting as a judicial body. 
At the same time, and perhaps more important, the document also created a favorable legal setting for Richard Henderson’s business in land speculation. In fact, only a small part of the document was devoted to governance; it was in large measure a contract dictating a legal framework for land transfers. Although Henderson did not remain in Tennessee like many of the other signatories, the document created a legal means for land transactions to occur, including the transfer of land from Native Americans to the early settlers. By 1784, about one third of the men who had signed the compact had been killed in battles with Native Americans. Additionally, many of their forts had been destroyed during Native American attacks. Despite these setbacks, the Cumberland Compact still represents one of the earliest declarations of self-governance for the state of Tennesseee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Cumberland Compact was drawn up in May of 1780 by Richard Henderson, a land speculator and representative for North Carolina on the western Virginia/North Carolina survey team. The contract was signed in “Nashborough,” Tennessee, by 250 men of the new Cumberland settlement and established early government institutions (the infrastructure of courts, governance, and taxation) for the first settlers of the Tennessee territory. The Compact called for the creation of a civil government, and represented the settlers’ desire for self-governance and independence from North Carolina. Yet only a small part of the document was devoted to governance; it was in large measure a contract dictating a legal framework for land transfers. For instance, it dictated the legal grounds by which title to Native American land would be transferred to the new settlers, some of whom were land speculators. A complete transcription of the Cumberland Compact is available in A. W. Putnam's book, History of Middle Tennesseee; or, Life and Times of General James Robertson (Nashville, Tennessee, 1859). Included in this transcription is a complete list of all signatories. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33634_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

<dc:description>Knoxville 30th July 1796 
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. 
The Short time in which I conceived it was necessarily my duty to convene the Legislature, compelled me to call you together on so short a notice: In the first instance, it was necessary to give all the time the emergency of the occasion would admit of, and in the second from a circumstance, that the election to be held for Representatives was approaching so near at hand, made it necessary as I conceived for the Assembly to have it in their power, by a timely meeting should they in their wisdom deem it proper, to make an alteration in the act directing the mode of electing Representatives to represent this State in the Congress of the United States, before the day of election should arrive as directed in the aforesaid Act, otherwise it might be attended with disputes and contentions of a disagreeable nature, for by a late act congress the intended number of our Representatives is diminished, of course it proportionally lessens our number of electors for President and Vice President of the United States; Thus such derangement will necessarily require an alteration in our acts passed for such purposes. 
Our Senators not being recognized in the Senate of the United States, is another matter for your consideration and attention, and for your more ample information, the several acts and communications accompanying this address, will elucidate unto you, the propriety of my calling the Assembly together at this time. 
I hope I may be permitted to observe, that it is of importance and conducive to public happiness to arrange our public acts conformably with those of Congress, so far as they shall respect this State. 
The foregoing are the reasons, why I have thought proper to convene the Assembly in Session on the present day. and I make</dc:description>

I have the pleasure of announcing to you Gentlemen the admission of the State of Tennessee into the general union, a circumstance, pregnant with every flattering prospect, of peace, happiness and opulence to our infant State: The period is at length arrived, when the people of the Southwestern Territory may enjoy all the blessings and liberties of a free and independent republic.

<dc:title>An Ordinance for Circumscribing the Counties of Greene and Hawkins and Laying out Two New Counties</dc:title>
<dc:description>&quot;An Ordinance for Circumscribing the Counties of Greene and Hawkins and Laying Out Two New Counties&quot; is the first resolution appearing in the bound collection of acts passed by the Southwest Territory. The act is written in script and is four pages long.  The act gives specific boundary lines of the two new counties. The resolution was passed at Knoxville on June 11, 1792. It is signed by Governor William Blount and the territorial secretary, Daniel Smith.  On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory.
	The extent of the new territory was well defined. Containing about 43,000 square miles of land, it was restricted to North Carolina’s western district bounded on the north by the boundary of North Carolina and Virginia; on the west by a line in the middle of the Mississippi River, on the south by the parallel 35 degrees north and on the east by a jagged line running from the northeast to southwest connecting some dominant mountain peaks. It was this territory that in 1796 would become the state of Tennessee.

The acts passed by the elected General Assembly were varied, reflecting the interests of the territorial lawmakers. It was felt by the Governor and his representatives that statehood would become more likely with the creation of counties and towns. The act creating the counties of Greene and Hawkins County was approved on November 20, 1792. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33665_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

<dc:title>Declaration of Rights; also, the constitution or form of government; State of Frankland</dc:title>
<dc:description>This constitution is the &quot;Houston Constitution,&quot; rejected by Franklin's Second Constitutional Convention of 1785 in Greeneville.  Constitutional committee member and major contributor Rev. Samuel Houston had these pamphlets printed to argue the merits of the rejected document in the preface.  Still infused with the spirit of the American Revolution and with an appetite already whetted by forays into self-government, the inhabitants of North Carolina’s trans-Appalachian counties of Washington, Sullivan, and Greene jumped at the opportunity that North Carolina’s cession of its western lands presented.  The state of North Carolina faced financial distress and carried the burden of war debt.  The challenges of governing its distant western settlements proved a strain.  The legislature of North Carolina orchestrated the “Great Land Grab of 1783,” allowing many of its members and major land speculators to obtain title to the best lands in the area.  Thus, it seemed advantageous to cede its western lands to Congress in 1784, with the provision that the titles remain valid.

Western residents of the Holston-Watauga region met in that same year at Jonesborough and unanimously confirmed their interest in forming an independent state.  When they met again in Jonesborough in December of 1784, they drafted a temporary, provisional constitution for the newly-formed State of Franklin, named in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Unbeknownst to them, a month earlier North Carolina had repealed its Cession Act.  http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33664_Intro.pdf

<dc:description>The proposed “Houston Constitution” represented here fits into the progression of constitutional considerations which faced the Franklinites as their young state developed and as they continued deliberations on adopting a “form of government.” The dissension caused by this process eroded support for the State of Franklin and contributed to its demise.  The meeting of western residents at Jonesborough in August of 1784 set things into motion. With the decision to opt for independent statehood came the election of delegates to a December 1784 convention set to draft a constitution. A provisional constitution based on North Carolina’s Constitution of 1776 was adopted as a temporary outline of government. Some minor changes were made to the North Carolina model, such as abolishing or reducing property requirements for holding an elected position. This Jonesborough Constitution contained a bill of rights as well, but, most notably, it was prefaced with a declaration of independence. This section aired the grievances of the western inhabitants and provided their justifications for seeking statehood.  This Jonesborough Constitution was lost to history until 1904. At that time, a copy was located in the office of the Insurance Commissioner in the capitol building at Raleigh, North Carolina. It was printed in the Charlotte Daily Observer on September 25, 1904 and appeared in the October 1904 issue of The American Historical Magazine. Samuel Cole Williams also included a copy of this Constitution in the appendix to his History of the Lost State of Franklin. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33664_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

fifteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, did provide for the calling of a Convention by the people of the State, to meet at Nashville, on the second Monday in January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and for the election of delegates for the purpose of amending or revising the present Constitution, or forming and making a new Constitution; and, 

Whereas, The people of the State, in the mode provided by said Act, have called said Convention, and elected Delegates to represent them therein; Now, therefore, 

We, the Delegates and Representatives of the people of the State of Tennessee, duly elected, and in Convention assembled, in pursuance of said Act of Assembly, have ordained and established the following Constitution and form of government for this State, which we recommend to the people of Tennessee for their ratification: That is to say - 
ARTICLE I. 

Declaration of Rights. 

Section 1. That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness; for the advancement of those ends they have at all times, an unalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper. 

Section 2. That government being instituted for the common benefit, the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind. 

Section 3. That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship. 

Section 4. That no political or religious test, other than an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and of this State, shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state. 

Section 5. That elections shall be free and equal, and the right of suffrage, as hereinafter declared, shall never be denied to any person entitled thereto, except upon a conviction by a jury of some infamous crime, previously ascertained and declared by law, and judgment thereon by court of competent jurisdiction. 

Section 6. That the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate, and no religious or political test shall ever be required as a qualification for jurors. 

Section 7. That the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions, from unreasonable searches and seizures; and that general warrants, whereby an officer may be commanded to search suspected places, without evidence of the fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, whose offences are not particularly described and supported by evidence, are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be granted. 

Section 8. That no man shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life,</dc:description>

liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land. 

Section 9. That in all criminal prosecutions, the accused hath the right to be heard by himself and his counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof, to meet the witnesses face to face, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and in prosecutions by indictment or presentment, a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the County in which the crime shall have been committed, and shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself. 

Section 10. That no person shall, for the same offence, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb. 

Section 11. That laws made for the punishment of acts committed previous to the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are contrary to the principles of a free Government; wherefore no Ex post facto law shall be made. 

Section 12. That no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate. The estate of such persons as shall destroy their own lives shall descend or vest as in case of natural death. If any person be killed by casualty, there shall be no forfeiture in consequence thereof. 

Section 13. That no person arrested and confined in jail shall be treated with unnecessary rigor. 

Section 14. That no person shall be put to answer any criminal charge but by presentment, indictment or impeachment. 

Section 15. That all prisoners shall be available by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offences, when the proof is evident, or the presumption great. And the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in case of rebellion or invasion, the General Assembly shall declare the public safety requires it. 

Section 16. That excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 

Section 17. That all courts shall be open; and every man, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial, or delay. Suits may be brought against the State in such manner and in such courts as the Legislature may by law direct. 

Section 18. The Legislature shall pass no law authorizing imprisonment for debt in civil cases. 

Section 19. That the printing presses shall be free to every person to examine the proceedings of the Legislature; or of any branch or officer of the government, and no law shall ever be made to restrain the right thereof. The free communication of thoughts and opinions, is one of the invaluable rights of man and every citizen may freely speak, write, and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty. But in prosecutions for the publication of papers investigating the official conduct of officers, or men in public capacity, the truth thereof may be given in evidence; and in all indictments for libel, the jury shall have a right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the court, as in other criminal cases.

Section 21. That no man’s particular services shall be demanded, or property taken, or applied to public use, without the consent of his representatives, or without just compensation being made therefore.

Section 30. That no hereditary emoluments, privileges, or honors, shall ever be granted or conferred in this State. 

Section 31. That the limits and boundaries of this State be ascertained, it is declared they are as hereafter mentioned, that is to say: Beginning on the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, in latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north; running thence along the extreme height of the said mountain, to the place where Watauga river breaks through it; thence a direct course to the top of the Yellow Mountain, where Bright’s road crosses the same; thence along the ridge of said mountain, between the waters of Doe river and the waters of Rock creek, to the place where the road crosses the Iron Mountain; from thence along the extreme height of said mountain, to the place where Nolichucky

<dc:title>1870 Constitution</dc:title>
<dc:date>1870</dc:date>
<dc:type>Text</dc:type>
<dc:description>Tennessee’s Constitution of 1870 was ratified in the wake of the Civil War and codified basic changes from that defining event in American history. The constitution remained essentially unchanged until 1953 and became in due course “the nation’s oldest unamended state constitution.” It is still the fundamental charter for the State of Tennessee. The most profound change in the 1870 Constitution was the permanent abolition of slavery in Tennessee. The real purpose of the Constitution’s framers, however, was to undo the electoral laws and other measures passed by Reconstruction governor William G. Brownlow. Conservative Democrats—many of them ex-Confederates—dominated the constitutional convention, and they were determined to prevent any future heavy-handed governorship such as Brownlow’s Radical regime. Delegates were driven by fear of an arbitrary executive and sought a Constitution that would guard against such abuses and excesses of state government from recurring. Many delegates had been disenfranchised by Brownlow and some imprisoned, and they were committed to restoring universal male suffrage. There was a good deal of argument over black men voting. With the passage of the 15th Amendment to the US Constitution (even though Tennessee voted NOT to ratify), convention delegates knew they could not repeal suffrage for African Americans. A Radical US Congress was watching for just such a misstep by former Confederate states. Instead, the convention authorized a poll tax in the Constitution as a tool for controlling who voted. To prevent the evils of Brownlowism from returning to the state, the convention enshrined in the Constitution certain restrictions on the governor’s power, namely, that he: 1.	Could not suspend habeas corpus 2.	Could not call out the militia without consent of the legislature 3.	Could not appoint local judges and county officials 4.	Had only limited veto power, which could be overridden by a simple majority of the General Assembly  The 1870 Constitution also put limits on the legislature’s ability to meet in marathon sessions, to enact omnibus bills, and to saddle the state with large debts. In a constitutional addendum, all of Brownlow’s judicial and county office appointments were vacated, effectively clearing out many Union loyalists appointed during Reconstruction. Such measures proved popular in a state devastated by war and weary of the turmoil of Radical Reconstruction. The new Constitution was approved in a statewide referendum by a vote of 98,128 to 33,872.</dc:description>

<dc:title>An Act to Cut and Clear a Waggon Road to the Settlements on the Cumberland River in the Mero District</dc:title>
<dc:description>The document is a six page, unnumbered handwritten document found in the &quot;Acts of the Southwest Territory.&quot; It is dated September 27, 1794 and signed by Governor William Blount and Secretary David Wilson.  On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory.
	The extent of the new territory was well defined. Containing about 43,000 square miles of land, it was restricted to North Carolina’s western district bounded on the north by the boundary of North Carolina and Virginia; on the west by a line in the middle of the Mississippi River, on the south by the parallel 35 degrees north and on the east by a jagged line running from the northeast to southwest connecting some dominant mountain peaks. It was this territory that in 1796 would become the state of Tennessee.
	The new territory had two centers of population approximately 150 miles apart, separated by the Cumberland Mountains. The larger population, some 28,000, was in the eastern part of the territory in a corridor from 25 to 60 miles wide that extended from the Virginia line down the Holston River Valley about 110 miles to the southwest. Settlements were clustered along the Holston, Watauga, Nolichucky, French Broad and Little Rivers and their tributaries. The smaller Cumberland settlements of approximately 7,000 were located along an 80 mile stretch of the Cumberland River from Bledsoe’s Lick in the east to Clarksville in the west. The Indians regarded settlements in the Cumberland area and in certain parts of the Holston Valley as encroachments on their territory.

<dc:description>1818 Letter from Cherokee Chiefs to Gov. McMinn
For the Raleigh Register.

A letter from the Cherokee Chiefs to his Excellency, Gov. Jos. McMinn, in answer to certain communications of his respecting their land and removal to the west.

Friend and Brother, Agency. November 21st. 1818.

In Council near Cherokee

Your communication of the 18th inst. was this day read in open council, explained and interpreted to the Chiefs assembled.  After deliberating with that attention which its contents justly merited, we have prepared the following sentiments from the centre of our hearts, and though expressed through the organs of unrefined sense, in all the simplicity of nature, incapable of polishing words, you will at once see the sentiments of your red brothers, in their true colors.

Brother, we know that we are under the protection of the Government of the United States, therefore are not insensible that we are also dependant on the humanity, generosity, and friendship of that magnanimous Government.
generosity, and friendship of that magnanimous Government.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We feel ourselves bound by the strongest bonds of brotherly and friendly attachment, to
observe all our obligations with the U. States in the most inviolable manner.

Brother, you seem to express a desire that we ought to keep friendship at home as well as abroad, and to permit all those who wish to emigrate to the Arkansas to exercise their own free will and choice, as well as those who would choose to remain. That principle is so consistent with our sentiments in all our actions, that we are not a little surprised to hear such a recommendation made by your Excellency, particularly when you have had such a fair opportunity of making yourself acquainted with the true sentiments and dispositions of the Nation. The actions of bad individuals certainly ought not to be attached to the nation in any country.

Brother, we perfectly agree with you in believing that the Great Spirit is incapable of frowning on the rulers of any nation whose sole object was to promote the best interest of their people.  But, most beloved Brother, permit us to ask you in the presence of that
Great Spirit, whether we would</dc:description>

from that Supreme Power, if we were to accede to your propositions, to compel a whole nation of 
people, contrary to their free will and choice, to leave the lands of their nativity, which 
mouldered the bones of their forefathers, and so much esteemed and reverenced by them; and at the 
same time withdraw from them the means of comfort and support, which all the solemnity of a treaty, 
 - ratified by the highest authority of the Government of the
U. States, had provided, by accepting of a pittance which would not be more than one tenth of 
competency of providing for the general removal?

Brother, the idea which you seem to convey respecting the late treaty appears that you are of 
opinion that the Cherokees of this country are bound to take reservations, or emigrate to the west 
of the Mississippi River, and no other alternative for their continuance here in common as usual.

Brother, we would ask you as a candid man, why did the stipulations of that treaty provide for the 
taking the census of both nations? - for an equal division of lands,
agreeably to their respective</dc:description>

<dc:description>numbers?  It cannot be sound reason to believe that it was proper to take the census of
both nations, when all those who took reservations were limited to but 640 acres to each and every 
head of a family, if it was not intended that the surplus of the lands were to remain in common for 
the benefit of this nation. The theory upon which you have founded the principles of taking private 
property for public good *  we are not fully capable of comprehending your Excellency's ideas on 
that point, unless you mean that the public good requires the acquisition of this country, and that 
you are determined to seize it. On these points, beloved Brother, how far the disposition of the 
Government of the U. States are disposed and determined to act towards
*          The Constitution by which we are bound together, gives to the Rulers the right to take 
private property for public good, but they are bound in every instance to give the full value 
thereof.
In proof of this General Jackson directed his army to take your property for their support, and I 
have no doubt that measure was in direct opposition to many of your people, for it even deprived 
many of them of the means of support; but the public good required that it should be done, and your 
people have been paid conformably to justice

<dc:description>your poor red brothers, you are the best judge; but yet we cannot for a moment withhold our sense 
of the humane benevolence, and benignity of the U. States, to believe that the country which has 
been solemnly guaranteed to the Cherokees by them, will be viewed as private property, and the 
obligations of all their treaties with the Cherokee people, trampled under foot.  That there have 
been faults and neglect agreeable to the admission of your Excellency respecting the not taking of 
the census X we will not deny, but on our part we are unable to discover any.  We have too much 
respect for the honor of the United States to attribute it to them.

X         Brothers, you express a wish to know why the census have not been taken in June last. To 
which I reply, that having been instructed by the Honorable Secretary of War etc.

X         Now Brothers it is very easy to perceive that there is faults on all sides, and as I 
conceive neither party can be interested, now in fact acquitted of neglect by any defense they can 
make. I am therefore willing on my part to let the subject go to rest. (Gov. McMinn's address to

<dc:description>No, Brother, in them we have the most unbounded confidence. We have had too many proofs of their justice and magnanimity, - of their liberality and friendship, for us to harbour, even for a moment, a suspicion that they would act unjustly towards us. No, Brother, our confidence in the U. States is so complete, that we believe, provided they have inadvertently injured us, by themselves, or agents, that they would redress our wrongs, when made known.
Brother, reason and Prudence are the monitors by which all prudent people and individuals ought to be guided. We know however that conscience is but the force of education. Religion is certainly commendable, but the force of our prejudices forbids that you should at once expect to see us embrace yours. We like yourselves found ours upon our prejudices, and follow the religion of our fathers. A different education would beget different prejudices, and, with your education we should, no doubt, adopt your prejudices as well as religion; this however is not to be expected in the pursuit of game in the wilderness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We have here the advantages of adopting the virtues of our white brothers, who surround us. Your Excellency is not unacquainted with the progress which we have made in agriculture and civilized life. The benign influence of religion has opened the eyes of many; and we do not believe that the epithet of Savage ought any longer to be applied to the Cherokee nation of people. But with a removal to the west, all our flattering prospect of civilized life must vanish.
Brother, with deliberation, candor and good nature, we again inform your Excellency that we have, decisively, rejected your propositions for an entire extinguishment of all our claims to lands east of the Mississippi River. And must again solicit your Excellency to cause the late treaty to be carried into full effect agreeably to the stipulations therein contained, as early as practicable.
Brother, we solicit an interview with your Excellency at the Agents office on the 23rd inst. At the acquiescence of your Excellency to this solicitation you will please to cause the cannon to be fired.
We have the pleasure of subscribing ourselves, intrinsically, your Brothers and Friends.

<dc:title>1818 Letter from Cherokee chiefs to Gov. McMinn</dc:title>
<dc:description>Seven handwritten pages, in ink, of a letter from various Cherokee leaders to Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn discussing the removal of Cherokees west of the Mississippi.  Notation at top: &quot;For the Raleigh Register.&quot; At end of letter: &quot;A True Copy attest; John Ross member of the Nation'l Committee.&quot; The 1818 letter from the Cherokee chiefs to Gov. McMinn, in effect, stated it would be against the best interests of the Cherokees to compel a whole nation of people, contrary to their free will and choice, to leave the land of their nativity.  Furthermore, Cherokee leadership flatly rejected your propositions for an entire extinguishment of all our claims to lands east of the Mississippi river.  The letter of 1818 represents the Cherokees determination, albeit futile, to remain a free and distinct nation rather than acquiesce to the unfair demands of the United States government.  A printed copy of the letter, including the names of those Cherokee leaders and warriors who signed it can be found in the American State Papers, Indian Affairs, II: 486-487.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This letter, written and signed by over forty chiefs and warriors of the Cherokee National Council, is addressed to Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn and dated November 21, 1818. McMinn, under pressure from the United States government and land-hungry speculators, found himself in the position of trying to coerce the Cherokees to relinquish their lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi. Specifically, the letter is a reaction to the stipulations of the Treaty of 1817 which presented the eastern Cherokee with two options: removal or citizenship. Those Cherokees who decided to move to Arkansas would be provided with tracts of land similar to what they left behind; while those who decided to stay would have to become American citizens and be confined within reservations of 640 acres per each head of household. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33637_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>

<dc:title>King George III's Proclamation of 1763</dc:title>
<dc:description>The first in a bound collection of colonial documents is a complete copy of the Proclamation of 1763 promulgated at the end of the French and Indian War by King George III of Great Britain. The item is hand-written in ink on paper, copied by John Milton, Georgia Secretary of State.  
 Issued by the British Crown at the end of the French &amp; Indian War, the Proclamation of 1763 laid out the system of governing the North American interior which had been won from France and decreed that the Indians and their land would be treated with respect. It is one of the first colonial documents that pertained to the area that would become Tennessee. In it George III pronounces his intention to reward soldiers in the recent war with bounty land obtained by consent from the natives-a novel concept that henceforth would be the model for distributing western lands. More importantly for the settlement of Tennessee, the king forbade his colonial subjects to move west beyond the crest of the Appalachians and trespass on Indian land. This edict was promptly ignored by frontiersmen who began to move into what is now East Tennessee, sowing seeds of resentment towards the Crown that would flower into open rebellion during the Revolution. The Proclamation of 1763 actually marks the beginning of forays by hunters into the Tennessee country, soon to be followed by the migration of backcountry families onto transmontane lands claimed by natives. The early history of Tennessee prior to American independence can be seen as a sustained effort by pioneer settlers to thwart and circumvent the provisions of this proclamation, much to the detriment of Tennessee’s native people.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This 1795 copy of King George III’s proclamation at the close of the French &amp; Indian War (aka Seven Year’s War) is one of the earliest and most significant documents for the history of Tennessee. The copy was produced by Georgia’s first Secretary of state, John Milton, and was found among the papers of John Sevier (Tennessee’s first governor and one of the chief violators of the edict). Promulgated after the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the proclamation lays out the British Crown’s regulations for the governance of its new territories in North America. Specifically, the king introduces the bounty land warrant system as a method of paying soldiers of the war, a method of public land disposal that was adopted by the colonies (later states) of North Carolina and Virginia and greatly impacted the distribution of Tennessee land. George III also proclaims a desire to protect the native inhabitants of America by prohibiting his American subjects from migrating and settling across the crest of the Appalachian mountains. The prohibition had little effect in stemming the tide of American westward movement. http://www.tn.gov/tsla/founding_docs/33639_HistNote.pdf</dc:description>
