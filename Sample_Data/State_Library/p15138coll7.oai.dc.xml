<dc:description>Big Ridge Park is a heavily forested, 3,687-acre park which lies on the southern shore of Tennessee Valley Authority's Norris Reservoir, approximately 25 miles north of Knoxville.  It was one of five demonstration parks developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority in cooperation with the National Park Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps (C. C. C.) as an example of public recreation development along Tennessee Valley Authority lakeshores. The structures on the park reflect the craftsmanship and stonework of the Civilian Conservation Corps.</dc:description>

C. planted hundreds of thousands of trees which make up many of the pine stands that you see on the forest today.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.   Tom Mix was a silent movie star who helped define the &quot;Western&quot; film genre.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hobart Parrish describing how aware he was of the conditions in the Great Depression and the New Deal.  He saw pictures from New York or Pittsburgh of people in soup lines.  In his area they were unable to sell produce but mostly raised their own food. They only had to buy certain items (like salt and black pepper) from peddling wagons.  The Depression made it difficult to make money, but didn't impact rural areas in the same manner as it did in the towns.</dc:description>

He also attended night school at Clarksville High School, which was permitted in the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Some Civilian Conservation Corps men went to Austin Peay as well.  He also took courses given at the camp, such as engineering, soil conservation, mechanics, blacksmithing, or forestry.  He mostly took engineering classes.  Civilian Conservation Corps leaders also taught crews about how to prevent erosion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Parrish states that he believes when the Civilian Conservation Corps first ecamped outside Clarksville the locals were a taken aback by their presence, but after a while they became accepted, and locals even provided them lunch.  They eventually became a soil conservation service camp.  Their original camp number, SCS8, reflects this.  The camp's forestry number had been P63 when they were a forestry camp.  Camps were numbered according to the kind of work the camp specialized in.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps did the initial development of the Pickett State Forest site following the donation of the 12,000 acres to the state by Stearns Coal and Lumber Company in 1933.  Between 1934 and 1942, hiking trails, cabins, a lodge, a ranger station, and a 12-acre lake were put in place.  Much native sandstone rock was used by the Civilian Conservation Corps in building construction. Civilian Conservation Corps employees quarried the stone from the area.  The Park appears on the National Register of Historic Places.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The money made by the Civilian Conservation Corps could be spent by the family and it would help the towns that it went to.  A butchershop owner once told Parrish if it hadn't been for Civilian Conservation Corps money he would've had to close.  It helped the Civilian Conservation Corps families, the shop owners, and the towns.  Boys in the camps learned a trade and the ones that played music or had comedic talent performed in the camps.  While on the Mississippi River doing flood control, one worker drowned; that is the only fatality from his camp he is aware of.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Parrish recalls that no Civilian Conservation Corps workers he knew of ever got into trouble while he was in the camp. He states they didn't always behave, but they never got caught.  There was an officer in Clarksville who wanted to catch men from the Civilian Conservation Corps camp misbehaving.  There was a bootlegger that supplied them with whiskey and the officer tried to catch Civilian Conservation Corps boys going there but never had any luck.  Also comments on how camps enforced their own rules and policed themselves.  Comments on different denominations of churches.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.</dc:description>
