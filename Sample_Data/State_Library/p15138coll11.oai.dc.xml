<dc:description>In 1922, 125 acres in south Knoxville (the Dickinson estate in Island Home Park) was acquired to be the new home of the Tennessee School for the Deaf.  Marr &amp; Holman, a prominent Nashville architectural firm, was hired to design the new campus buildings. (Thomas S. Marr  had attended the Tennessee School for the Deaf from 1877 to 1884.)  In 1926 this dormitory building was added.  The contractor was V. L. Nicholson. Other structures would follow and expand the campus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Negro Department at the Tennessee School for the Deaf was established in 1881.  It secured a permanent location in 1885 with the purchase of the Abner G. Jackson home on Dandridge Pike.  Radical improvements took place in 1940, when a cement block extension was added to the main building.  That addition, pictured here, contained an auditorium, classrooms, a domestic arts department, a shop, and the central heating plant. Principal Henry C. Edmunds helped with the construction.</dc:description>
