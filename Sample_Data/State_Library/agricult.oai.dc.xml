<dc:description>In June, the binder would be taken through the ripe wheat fields to cut the wheat and bind it into bundles. Shocks would then be stacked by workers. Each shock was generally fourteen bundles and capped by two bundles. Following the completion of the process, the wheat would be allowed to dry in preparation for threshing.Mule-powered machinery proved revolutionary and became central to the Tennessee farm economy.  Such animal-powered machines allowed farmers to dispense with much hand work.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This image highlights the importance of the mule to the development of Tennessee's farm economy. They would overtake oxen between 1870 and 1880 to become the state's main draft animals and work stock. Advances in machinery allowed for lighter and more  maneuverable plows, and that contributed to the switch from the more powerful oxen to mules and horses.  The relatively light wooden plow being used is most likely to be a cultivating plow, rather than a breaking plow.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mules were the key element in Tennessee’s farm economy. The extension of mule power allowed farmers to handle more land, get over their fields faster and achieve higher productivity. Although tractors made their first appearance in Tennessee during the 1920s, they were initially little more than a curiosity. It wasn’t until after World War II that mechanization replaced mules on a majority of Tennessee farms.  However, many small farmers were still working with mules well into the 1950s.</dc:description>

On October 20, 1863, during the Civil War, two Confederate cavalry regiments attacked and routed a Union brigade at Philadelphia while conducting maneuvers following the Battle of Chickamauga.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The threshing machine (or simply thresher), was a machine first invented by Scottish mechanical engineer Andrew Meikle for use in agriculture.  It was invented (c.1784) for the separation of grain from stalks and husks.  Mechanization of this process took much of the drudgery out of farm labor. About 1910, horse pulled combines appeared and became a success. Later, gas and diesel engines appeared with other refinements and specifications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In June, binders would be taken through the ripe wheat fields to cut the wheat and bind it into bundles. Shocks would then be stacked by workers. Each shock was generally fourteen bundles and capped by two bundles. Following the completion of the binding process, the wheat would be allowed to dry in preparation for threshing.Mule-powered machinery proved revolutionary and became central to the Tennessee farm economy. Such animal-powered machines allowed farmers to dispense with much hand work at harvest.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Following the drying of the wheat shocks, thresher crews would arrive in the fields.  Thresher equipment, run by tractor or steam engine would be set up. Workers would then gather the shocks into a wagon and take them to the threshing operation, where they would be fed into the machine. Threshing machines worked faster and supplied a cleaner product that old methods of treading out or flailing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The log cabin is a familiar symbol of Tennessee's pioneer period. Although its use as shelter is well known, its quaint image has tended to obscure its importance as a bridge between civilization and the wilderness. The most important and enduring use of log construction occurred in the dwellings, barns, and related outbuildings of the thousands of independent farmsteads. Logs were used for the construction of smokehouses, tobacco barns, stock barns, and corn cribs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>By 1840 Tennessee was the leading corn-producing state in the Union, with 12 percent of the nation's total. Ten years later, the state grew enough corn to feed its three million hogs, the most in the nation.  Corn continued to play a prominent role in post-Civil War agriculture, although prices did not recover to their pre-war level for several decades. In autumn, when the ears of corn were ripe, farmers cut the stalks of corn and stacked them in shocks in the field.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The widespread use of horse-powered threshing machines exemplifies the adoption of labor-saving machinery in Tennessee in the post-Civil War era. These machines separated small grain from the stems faster than treading or flailing while producing a cleaner product.  Although cost was a defintie factor, more and more farmers were rejecting the traditional agricultural methods and Tennessee became a flourishing market for horse-powered farm implements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sorghum is a member of the grass family introduced into the United States in 1853. Sorghum also refers to the syrup produced from the juice extracted when the sorghum plant is boiled. The sorghum industry became widespread in the South about the time of the Civil War when food supplies became scarce.  The stalks of the sorghum plant were also used for fodder. Today Tennessee and Kentucky are the leading producers of sorghum.</dc:description>

Note that the American chestnut is still being offered for sale at this time;this is prior to the full impact of the chestnut blight that appeared in the U.S. in 1904 and wiped out the U.S. Chestnut trees.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This map demonstrates the rich mineral resources available for potential manufacturers in Tennessee during the nineteenth century. At the time, northern investors were purchasing huge acreages in mineral rich areas of Appalachia.  Tennessee was an early leader in iron ore production. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, the focus shifted to coal mining.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Killebrew had been pivotal in the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture for Tennessee in 1871.  He served as the Secretary and took charge of the Bureau's publications. When the Bureau was reorganized in 1875, Killebrew was named the first Commissioner of Agriculture; he served until 1880.  The extended title of the Bureau appearing on the letterhead reveals the widespread responsibilites inherent in the development of agriculture in Tennessee.</dc:description>

It definitely behoved the railroad companies to encourage immigration and the sale of ore, farm, and timber lands along their lines.  J. B.

By 1870, an expanded market demand for agricultural products brought adoption of improved technology and resulting increases in farm production.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the antebellum period, many Tennessee farmers pursued what they thought would be a promising commercial opportunity in the production of silk. Fueling their optimism were discoveries in the 1830s that silkworms thrived on the native mulberry tree.These circumstances gave rise to a flurry of interest and activity in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1840 supporters formed the Tennessee Silk Society to promote production of cocoons and use of the fabric. Unfortunately, disease destroyed the small industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Farmers' Alliance made its first appearance in Tennessee in the winter of 1887. In March 1888 farmers organized the Tennessee State Alliance and elected John P. Buchanan, a Rutherford County livestock man, as the first president.  In 1889 the Farmers' Alliance joined the Agricultural Wheel to become the National Farmers' and Laborers' Union. The Alliance urged farmers to adopt scientific and business practices, diversify their crops, and become self-sufficient in order to break the debt cycle.</dc:description>
