<dc:description>Letter to his family dated Nov. 26, 1967, begins, &quot;At 9:30 this morning seven of us hopped aboard the truck to take us to the outer edge of the perimeter. We were going for a 3 click (3,000 meters) patrol outside the camp.&quot; On his first patrol he found  propoganda leaflets in a cleared area, rice paddies, water buffaloes, children asking for cigarettes, and pot growing in a field.

<dc:description>Three-page letter describes a plane crash on Vung Chua that killed eight South Korean officers. (The plane, still visible on the mountain, and a nearby monument are pictured in Ammons's photos.) No one knows why the plane was so far from the Qui Nhon Airfield, where it was trying to land. Ammons, describing the current inclement weather, conjectures that the thick cloud cover and heavy rain may have confused the pilot.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The UH-1 (or as it was originally designated the HU-1) &quot;Huey&quot; is one of the most recognizable and widely used helicopters in the world.  During the Vietnam conflict, Huey's were used for many purposes including MedEvac, command and control, air assault, personnel and material transport, etc.  It has several distinctive characteristics such as a rounded nose, a twin-bladed rotor, and the loud &quot;whomp-whomp&quot; sound the helicopter makes in flight.  Approximately 7,000 UH-1 aircraft saw service in Vietnam.</dc:description>

<dc:description>According to Ammons, regulations for carrying ammunition for the M-60 machine gun were relaxed for patrols around Vung Chua Mountain.  During his first tour in the front lines of the delta, he said, ammunition was stored in boxes. These boxes were hard to carry, but kept the rounds clean and prevented jamming.  On Vung Chua ammunition was carried more casually whenever the threat of enemy attack was reduced.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Various kinds of seismic detection devices were used in Vietnam.  Ammons has said that a specialist in the use of this equipment was attached to his unit, and Chris frequently aided in their installation.  These devices detected footsteps of intruders, but were frequently set off by Vietnamese wildlife or the tremors caused by passing aircraft.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ammons has explained that soldiers on Vung Chua seldom wore helmets or uncomfortable flak vests on standard patrols.  This expedition was either a special patrol across the bay (to lay seismic detectors) or a trip to Qui Nhon, both of which would have required soldiers to wear their full equipment.</dc:description>

Men, like the individual pictured, typically cut the grass and maintained the grounds; many of the women polished boots and cleaned the floors at the base.</dc:description>

<dc:description>According to Ammons, two or three formations would gather in the central location on the base at Cam Ranh Bay to hear the reading of the names of men who were leaving Vietnam to return home.  The formations would wait until the list was read, after which time those whose names were called flew out of Cam Ranh Bay back to the United States.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Claymore anti-personnel mines contain a C-4 explosive charge and approximately 700 steel balls about the size of #4 birdshot. They can be detonated by remote control.  When detonated they distribute the munitions in a 60-degree fan-shaped pattern because of the convex shape of the front of the charge. Thus a mine acts much like a large shotgun, peppering the area with metal fragments up to 100 meters in front of the mine.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pictured are the large tropospheric arrays on top of the mountain. The tropospheric array was designed to bounce microwave radio signals into the atmosphere and then back down to receivers. This system was extremely effective in transmitting signals in mountainous or densely forested regions, and it was used extensively in Vietnam.</dc:description>

<dc:relation>Desire to go out….
to present himself to…
hamlet or military post…
If you see any soldier who belongs to the Republic of Vietnam or Allied armed forces, you just need to raise your hands over your head and shout, “Open arms!” Designated Open Arms places will be established in provinces. Speakers from airplanes will inform you of where these places are located so that you can safely present yourselves there.
If your “Open arms” surrender happens from one o’clock in the morning, October 9, to midnight October 15, you will be eligible for a $2000 reward along with other benefits that are available to the returnees. You will be warmly welcomed and kindly treated. 246-131-68 (Translations provided by the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute)</dc:relation>
