Neither did it have a library, an encyclopedia, nor a dictionary. At least twenty-five cents a year was spent on each student but the structure itself was in very poor condition.  Evidence of good housekeeping was observed.  Evidently, the only source of heat was a fireplace at one end of the building.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The William J. Hale School, located on McGhee Street in Maryville, was built in early 1930 with Rosenwald funds.  The school opened in 1931 and Mrs. Octavia B. Hoard was the first principal.   The Hale School replaced the T. B. Lillard School, built about 1910.  The T. B. Lillard School was named for Thomas B. Lillard, an African American and progressive businessman from Maryville.  The Lillard School was located at the rear of the A.M.E. Church on what is now Harper Avenue.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the first decades of the twentieth century, Tennessee made efforts to erect healthier and more modern schools, hire better trained teachers, provide for student transportation, and to more competently manage and supervise education practices.  The state also embarked upon a program of consolidation and new construction so that schools like Old Bells Colored were abandoned.  Bells Consolidated Rosenwald School replaced it.</dc:description>

<dc:description>War Creek School was in the first district of Hancock County.  William B. Harrison served as superintendent of schools from 1928 to 1936. The school was listed as abandoned when photographed in 1931. This was probably a result of the consolidation of schools that took place in the first decades of the twentieth century as the state strove to improve its public school system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Nelson Merry School was built Approximately 1890 through the efforts of the Reverend Peter Guinn, a black Baptist minister. The institution was named for the Reverend Nelson Merry, a pioneer Baptist who preached in Nashville.  The school remained a Baptist academy until 1932 when control passed to Jefferson County.  Construction of a new building was made possible through the Rosenwald Foundation (the photograph here is of the &quot;old&quot; structure). The school closed its doors in 1965.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This beautiful home was built by W. W. Holt and was located on land bordering Church, Poplar and Magnolia Streets in Lynchburg.  It was first used as a High School in the 1926-1927 academic year.  It had four tall columns fronting the house, and there were two floors plus a basement.  The house was chosen as the county high school in 1927 and served in that capacity until 1932.  It was razed to make way for real estate development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The town of Adams is located in the northwest section of Robertson County. The old school is emblematic of the educational opportunities available for African Americans in the first half of the twentieth century.  Between 1910 and 1940, only 60% of white school-age children in Tennessee attended class.  The rate was lower in the black communities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The legislature passed a bill on April 4, 1881, establishing a school for the Negro deaf.  The Negro school was closed at the beginning of the Christmas holidays in 1940 and an extensive improvement program began.  Henry C. Edmunds, the principal, helped with the work.  Modern electric and heating systems were installed; the floors and walls were replaced; and a cement-block extension was built onto the back of the main building.</dc:description>
