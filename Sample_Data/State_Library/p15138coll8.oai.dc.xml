<dc:description>The Japanese style of asymmetrical art was exhibited during the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876.  The “Crazy” quilt pattern cropped up during the Victorian period as a way for women to include the Japanese design they had seen in their quilts.  Most Crazy quilts were made with silk, satin, or velvet as opposed to cotton and were only used as display quilts.  Crazy quilts can be identified by their uneven fabric blocks and the fine ornamental embroidery stitches on their tops.   Popular decorative motifs on these quilts included fans, animals, and insects.  Spiders and webs can often be seen on Crazy quilts as they were thought to bring good luck to the quiltmaker.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The word &quot;quilt&quot; is derived from the Latin word culcita, which means a stuffed sack, mattress, or cushion. A pieced butterfly is traditionally appliqued to a block, and the blocks are sewed together to form the quilt top. The Butterfly block pattern was a popular American design in the 1930s. The butterfly symbolized hope and new life during the Great Depression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Dresden Plate quilt pattern was one of the most popular quilts made during the 1920s and 30s. It was also called Grandmother's Sunburst, Friendship Ring, Aster, Dahlia, and Sunflower.  It is similar to the Fan patterns of the late 1800s.  Some Dresden Plate blocks seem to be made of four fans sewn together. Dresden, Germany, was known for its fine porcelain plates, which seem to have inspired this design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Dresden Plate quilt pattern was one of the most popular quilts made during the 1920s and 30s. It was also called Grandmother's Sunburst, Friendship Ring, Aster, Dahlia, and Sunflower.  It is similar to the Fan patterns of the late 1800s. Some Dresden Plate blocks seem to be made of four fans sewn together. Dresden, Germany, was known for its fine porcelain plates, which seem to have inspired this design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The sunbonnet design in quilting originated in the 1870s, based on the motif of a broad-brimmed bonnet that obscures the face of a young girl.  The pattern is frequently called &quot;Sunbonnet Sue,&quot; after a popular 1908 song.  The name was applied to the quilt pattern after the Great Depression.  In the South, the name &quot;Dutch Doll&quot; persisted until after national publications helped standardize quilt pattern names.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Martha A. (Jones) Gentry of Franklin, Tennessee, was the wife of Watson Meredith Gentry.  Her daughter was Susie Gentry (1860-1944).  Susie Gentry was a genealogist, artist, composer, historian, and regent of the Old Glory Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Williamson County.  Eight pointed star quilts appeared in England and the eastern United States in the early 1800s.  The tiny, colorful diamonds can resemble the patterns of a kaleidoscope.  Also known as Star of the East, Star of Bethlehem, and Lone Star, this pattern is popular with Native American quilters.  The Japanese style of asymmetrical art was exhibited during the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The &quot;Crazy&quot; quilt pattern cropped up during the Victorian period as a way for women to include the Japanese design they had seen in their quilts. Most Crazy quilts were made with silk, satin, or velvet as opposed to cotton and were only used as display quilts. Crazy quilts can be identified by their uneven fabric blocks and the fine ornamental embroidery stitches on their tops. Popular decorative motifs on these quilts included fans, animals, and insects. Spiders and webs can often be seen on Crazy quilts as they were thought to bring good luck to the quiltmaker.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The quilting bee became a tradition probably during the 19th Century.  Many bees were simply an occasion wherein women assisted one another in finishing quilts.  They eventually became an opportunity for women to gather in a social environment.  The bee itself often featured a large wooden frame around which many women would work on the same quilt.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The quilting bee became a tradition probably during the 19th Century.  Many bees were simply an occasion wherein women assisted one another in finishing quilts.  They eventually became an opportunity for women to gather in a social environment. The bee itself often featured a large wooden frame around which many women would work on the same quilt.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The two infants pictured were born about nine days apart and later married each other.  The Japanese style of asymmetrical art was exhibited during the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876.  The “Crazy” quilt pattern cropped up during the Victorian period as a way for women to include the Japanese design they had seen in their quilts.  Most Crazy quilts were made with silk, satin, or velvet as opposed to cotton and were only used as display quilts.  Crazy quilts can be identified by their uneven fabric blocks and the fine ornamental embroidery stitches on their tops.   Popular decorative motifs on these quilts included fans, animals, and insects.  Spiders and webs can often be seen on Crazy quilts as they were thought to bring good luck to the quiltmaker.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two letters of correspondence between Mrs. John Trotwood Moore and her cousin, Susie Gentry.  The first item of correspondence is from Susie Gentry to Mary Daniel Moore, written from Franklin, Tennessee, on May 28, 1934.  In her correspondence, Gentry discusses the Natchez Trace Road, the Old Glory Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Colonel Thomas Hart Benton Chapter of the United States Daughters of the War of 1812, and an inkblot she has made to look like a boy.  The second piece of correspondence is a response from Mrs. Moore, dated June 1, 1934.  Mrs. Moore states that she didn't know what an artist Miss Gentry was until she saw her lovely quilt and the ink spot on her letter.</dc:description>
