“I continued to get wors all the week untill I was verry bad with pain in my head and eyes als a bad cough. The next week I mended October 1st gradually untill Sunday, and though I had scarcely been out of the house for two weeks. I rode to Cool Spring and preached to large and attentive congn. I finished on the subject of the Kingdom of Christ and then returned very tired in deed.
On Monday I expected to be wors, but thanks to the Lord I am not.
The Yankies has not been here since June, But about the third Sunday September Rosecrans and Bragg fought some four days and Bragg whiped him verry badly drove him back 15 miles. Rosecrans lost 35 or 40 thousand, Bragg 5 thousand, and the cavelry have taken nearly all the towns in his rear, and has destroyed a vast ammount of waggons and stores.
On the fourth Sunday in October. I rode 6 miles to bellview and preached to a good congn. Dined at J. Tulloes, and then returned.
November 1863. On the second Sunday I rode 8 miles to Cool Spring to a large and attentive congn. Dined at Jordans and returned.
On the 20 I rode 5 miles and visited a verry sick young man, sung and prayed with him. And then returned 5 miles.
December 1863. I have been confined to home sowing wheet and for the want of something to write, it has been verry wet.
12th. Today rode 5 miles to L Poyners met with J. W. Wilson and Sister Vaughn had a long conversation upon the scriptures and the present war. Then returned 5 miles.
The first of this month Bragg and Grant fought two days at Lookout Mountain Grant lost ten thousand (10000) killed and twenty thousand wounded. Bragg lost one thousand killed and two thousand wounded with four thousand prisoners. What a dark and gloomy time, and the loss of life and treasure, but we must receive it as a chastisement from God.
24th. Today two Yankey soldiers came here for the first since June thank the Lord for guardin us thus far, and our fervant prayer is that he will continue his protection.”

[Page 508 (545)]

“This bring me to the close of the year 1863. Having rode187 miles, and preached.
Sermons		14 | Heard sermons		one
Funerals		 1  | Exhortations		none
Sacraments	        none | Ordained			none
Baptised	        none | 
I have rode less and preached less than any year since I have been preaching having been confined nearly all the year by the Yankies, who forbid me going from home, and by sickness myself and family. But my health is better now than it has been for three winters. But what preaching I done was better received, and larger congn than usual. I desire to thank the Lord for such tokens of divine favour for while many may all my breathern in the ministry that live near have been banished from thair homes and propert, and the citizens have all taken the oath, I have still escaped and permited to remain at home untill now. My dependence is entirely upon the Lord to direct me right through this year, and in this dark and trying hour.
January 1st 1864. Today verry cold turned cold last evening and hailed, and then snowed and remained very cold for two weeks. Then we had a week of pleasent weather. Then again a weeak of very cold.
February 2nd. My servants all left today 3 young men and two women and child, and went to the Yankies.
On the 7th some person broke down my stable door and took two horses and rode them off.
16th. Tonight a party of Fed Soldiers came and searched the hosue over twice, stoled a good many things and left.
20th. Today I was compelled to tak the oath of allegence or be driven off and loose my home. Being the only man in the county but what had taken an oath. If I have done wrong I pray God to forgive me. The weather has been very cold for a week.”

[Page 508 (546)]

“February 24th 1864. We had some good weather for some days.
29th. Today rained and hailed, and then snowed so as to brake down abundance of timber.
March 5th. Tonight came a gang of Yankey soldiers and threatened to shoot us. Broke down the meet house door and took 22 hams and shoulders. How long O Lord will though suffer me to be thus tried, and tempted by such out laws, pray the to give grace to bair it with patience. 
About the first of the month they fought in East Tenn, Florida, at Dothan Georgia, and Missis in which the rebels reputed them at each place. 7th we had rain and thunder.
9th. Tonight came and took all our fouls but three.

11th. today 5 miles to visit sick man.
13th. Today I am giving one dolar per bus for corn.
18th. The weather has been cold and cloudy all this month the most bacward Spring I ever saw. The trees hardly shows any buds yet. I still have a destressing cough.
I continued to preach regulary during the balance of this year to verry large and attentive congregations more so than usual. But I became so nervas, and having to labour for support that I have not kept up my regular record, wich I very much regret. I am compelled to labour as I lost about eight thousand dolars worth of property by the Yankeys, for wich I have never received any compensation. But I try to submit to it cheerfully seeing that it is the will of God that it should be so.
I preached five times in the Presbyterian Church in Franklin by their request, and they wished me to continue regular which I could not do on account of other engagements.”

[Page 509 (547)]

January 1st 1865. The war being over this year the South being overturned have to submit to every thing. They lost thair caus by being divided among themselves and many going over to the North, and the Yankies geting Troops from all other nations. Lee surendred to Grant on the 9th of April 65 which they never would have done if they had been united. And of had none but the North to fight. By such men we have lost our property and our liberty.
I am undetaking to make a crop by myself this year so I canot travel far during crop time having only one blind mair to do it with. I am preachin round by invitation in the houses of all denominations at Duglasses, Tompsons Station, in Spring hill, at the Brick Church, at the Presbyterian Church and west Harpeth at Mcays several times, at Buchannons Schoolhouse, at Stockets, at Johnstans, at Bell view, at Colage Grove and at Eagleville, also Chappel Hill. To large and respectable and interested congn. beside preachin regular for Cool Spring and Providence.
In September Bro Hix sent a buggy to Mr. Pettis and carried me to his house on Thursday night, on Friday at Flat Creek and at night in Lynchburg.
Saturday morning to the Elk river Association at Mount Mariah. Bro Wagner preached the introductory, then Bro West , and Bro Millhouse, I preached at night at Bro Holemans. On Sunday the congn. the largest I ever saw at an Association an twenty five preachers, Bro West preached then Bunyan Stevans. I preached last the congn. very attentive and feeling, Stevens preached at Holemans at night, on Monday Emmons, and then Been preached, Then I preached the last sermon by request from the congn. through the Association, at the close thair was great feeling from which a revival took place which has aded forty to the church. We ten went to Bro Greens, and on Tuesday Bro Forest and myself preached two funerals at county line and although it rained the congn. was very large. We then went to Bro Hicks, and next day he sent me to Bro. Pettises, and next morning I returned home.
I preached round during the fall, having traveled and preached more than I did last year, for this is the first Association that I have been to since the war commenced. And feel greatly revived in being presented to meet the Breathren again. And receive so many tokens of approbation and fellowship both from God and the Breathern.”</dc:relation>

Nov. 30th. Killed twenty-two hogs yesterday &amp; busy cutting up &amp; salting today - 
December 1st Settled with Shaffer in full for brick work done for me on Servant’s house &amp; Coal bin
“ 3rd Cold rain all day &amp; yesterday mixed with fine hail, trees glazed with a thick coat of ice, limbs occasionally falling with the heavy weight upon them. Thermometer 32°. Willie &amp; I in doors nearly all day. Yesterday was the day appointed for the execution of the notorious John Brown of Harpers Ferry &amp; Kansas memory. I see from reports by the telegraph that he has paid the extreme penalty of the law for his crimes at Harpers Ferry, where he headed an insurrection the object of which was to free the slaves of Virginia, some four or five others were condemned to die with him. This is the first scheme of the kind which has ever been openly attempted in this country &amp; it has promptly met with its just retribution, but yet I fear, speedily as it has been quelled it is but the beginning of a chain of events which will ultimately end in the dissolution of our glorious Union. Allen A. Hall has been commited to appear at the next term of the Criminal Court.
Dec. 7th Thermometer at 6 A.M. was 26° below freezing point. Earth covered with snow &amp; sleet. Fires quite comfortable (?)
Dec r  23rd Completed my fourth sitting with Dr Camlin Dentist, paid $43.75 for work done on my teeth consisting of seperating, filling &amp; cleaning. My dear wife has been gone more than three weeks, Oh! How could I live without her cheerful smiles &amp; love-beaming face to greet me when I come in from the toils of busy life. My love grows with my growth &amp; strengthens with my strength.”

Nov 15. Attended the funeral service &amp; burial of Dr. John T. Edgar who died on Monday [missing]ing last of Apoplexy. He performed the marriage ceremony for five of my father’s children, preached the funeral sermon of both my parents &amp; of six of their children. Dr. Bardwell, Dr. Edgar’s assistant pastor, preached his funeral sermon, many other ministers assisted him in the service – 
Nov 23rd Yesterday rain &amp; fine hail, today rain, snow &amp; high cold wind from the North-west. Wife busy putting up Turkeys &amp; chickens –
Dec 25th Christmas. Took dinner at Belmont Addison Hayes &amp; two daughters, Oliver &amp; wife &amp; two boys Hal Hayes, Mrs Pointer, self &amp; wife &amp; three children &amp; Mrs O. B. Hayes In present, had a merry time eating, drinking, chatting &amp;c. At night attended the girls Sallie A &amp; Adie H. to a small party at Mrs Louis’s.
Last month engaged Julius Ricon to lay off &amp; make with my force a road &amp; circle from front gate to front door. He is going ahead with it as fast as the weather will permit. This has been an expensive year to me as well as to many others. My meat gave out early, in August I think, my corn did not last until the new crop came on. I had therefore to buy both bread &amp; meat. My crop of corn was exceedingly small when it did come in consequence of the serious drouth. 
I am of the opinion that our beloved Union is drawing to an ignonimious end. Lincoln has been elected President &amp; the whole South is shaken from center to circumference –
God grant that we may be preserved from civil war &amp; a servile insurrection!”

I have added to my farming implements a harrow for three horses costing 20 dollars, a roller worth $16 &amp; other tools. Am plowing deep &amp; thoroughly am sowing &amp; planting in a manner to prevent washing, well-pulverising the soil &amp; c &amp; c.

April 25th A called session  of the Legislature commences today for the purpose of devising measures to meet the extraordinary times that are upon us. Nashville &amp; the State generally are busy in warlike preperations, companies are forming at this time in almost every district in the State.

July 4th our company discharged from service in consequence of the heavy expense it brought upon the State.
July 21st The Great Battle of Manassas was fought today, with great slaughter on both sides &amp; victory perched upon the Confederate Standard – The prospect for an abundant crop of everything is unusually fine – 
Aug 1st made a race for Lt. Col. of Militia and was defeated by a small vote, owing doubtless to my having come out as a candidate too late – and not getting votes enough to elect me

“Anno Domini 1862
January 1st. The internecine war of Lincoln waged against the unoffending South still progresses, every preparation is being made to fasten the yoke of bondage upon the beautiful &amp; chivalrous Southern country. But our people are determined to be forever free &amp; independent of the Northern fanatics &amp; tho the war may be long &amp; bloody we will never submit. Many battles have already been fought with great odds against us yet in almost every single engagement the Great God of battles has favored our side. Mason &amp; Slidell have been captured, thrown into prison &amp; subsequently ignominiously surrendered to the British Lion. The Stone Blockade has commenced &amp; England &amp; France are indignant. A fair product now exists of the breaking up of the blockade. Provisions are exceedingly scarce in the Cotton States. Pork is selling at $40 per barrel &amp; not enough to supply the demand. Beef has been packed extensively in this place and sells at $30 per barrel. The Government has bought many thousand hogs for the use of the Army at 10 cents gross. Clothing &amp; shoes bear enormous prices. We trust in Providence &amp; hope for the “better day a-coming”
Sunday Jan 19th The Revolution moves on, and attack upon Bowling-Green has been expected for some time but as the invader still stands aloof – Nashville seems to be the great aim of our enemy at present, he has already advanced upon Forts Henry &amp; Donelson &amp; causes considerable excitement here
Sunday Feb 16th A few days since Fort Henry fell into Federal hands. Today Nashville is all excitement in consequence of the surrender of Fort Donelson with Gen. Buckner &amp; some ten thousand men. Federals looked for him in a few days –“

Feb 23rd Sunday. The Federal Picket made their appearance opposite the City today. The wire and R.R. bridges have been destroyed by our forces. Gen Johnson has declared that he cannot defend the City. The Mayor will consequently make a formal surrender tomorrow or next day. Yesterday Jeff Davis was Inaugurated first President of the Confederate States under the permanent Constitution.
Feb 25th Federals under Buell have reached the City &amp; are landing in force. They say that private rights &amp; private property shall be protected.
March 1st More rain has fallen here than in any previous winter according to my recollection – Farming is consequently quite retarded – 
→ March 3rd Monday Morning at 5 O’Clock ←
Risley P Lawrence, 2nd, opened his peepers to the Terrestrial surroundings of Hillside, to the Colic &amp; to the world generally, like Eva’s his advent was marked by a Rainbow. May their blessings &amp; joys thro life be as numerous &amp; bright as the tints of that Rain-bow. Dr. Thomas Atchison called, but arrived after the frolic was over –
4th July. This day was celebrated here by a Military Procession &amp; Speaking at the Capitol. The display of Union flags about the City was meager in the extreme, scarce a dozen private houses showed their colors. The citizens took no part whatever in the Procession. The great battle of Shilo was fought in April, the two days fight of Seven Pines before Richmond &amp; the great battle of six days at the same place in which McClellan’s grand army was overwhelmed &amp; driven back fifteen miles was ended.
July 2nd. Rebels are Jubilant and are confident”

of final success. God grant that this bloody war may end but not until our Independence is achieved &amp; our rights fully recognized.
Our corn crop is splendid, or wheat indifferent our oat a failure. The Federal Soldiers have materially injured the Poultry crop in this region of country.
January Anno Domini 1863
Many incidents of importance to the People &amp; to the Nation have transpired since my last writing in this book, which are now matters of history. The first Summer in this portion of Tennessee witnessed a “Reign of Terror” which I hope never to see enacted again. Communication between this place &amp; Louisville being cut off gave license to the Federal Soldiers to commit acts of barbarism unbecoming a civilized people even toward a savage foe. Private rights of every character were trampled under foot in the most outrageous manner. But thank Heaven we have yet a little life to live upon &amp; things look a little better now. Gen. Negley was Commandant of this Post last Summer but his command is now at Murfreesboro. The great &amp; bloody Battle of Stone’s River has just been fought &amp; is now a matter of history.
May 1st My fencing being all destroyed or removed about my tillable land, have rented some land from Mrs Montgomery at $3 per acre, &amp; have made a garden in my Poultry yard. Daniel Bryson of the 78th Penn has been military guard for our Premises for six months.
June 1st The war still goes on with little or no prospect of a speedy termination. The Federal arms seem to be in the ascendent. Vicksburg &amp; Port Hudson are closely invest[missing]”

while Lee invades Pennsylvania.
July 4th Vicksburg surrenders to Grant &amp; Meade drives Lee from Pennsylvania. John Morgan is making his way into Ohio with what designs remains to be seen. Unusual amount of rain.
Aug 1st Port Hudson fell last Month John Morgan was captured, is now a prisoner within the walls of the Ohio State Prison. Bragg has fallen back to Look-out Mountain, Gilmore &amp; the Fleet have attacked Fort Wagner, meeting a repulse &amp; heavy loss. The prospect of the Confederacy at this time look decidedly “blue”. The draft is being carried out in the North generally including men of all colors &amp; the blacker the better. In New York however in consequence of mob violence &amp; resistance draft has been temporarily suspended. Gen R. L. Granger commander of this Post at this time &amp; the Military are kept in wholesome restraint &amp; discipline.

Notwithstanding the severity of the Weather, so far we have managed to keep up our fires up &amp; thanks to a kind Providence have a shelter yet to protect us from the storms &amp; a little in the “Larder” to feed upon. Made a little corn &amp; hay for the which are very thankful.
Friday March 11th Determined to make something to live upon if possible during these troublous times, I have this day formed a Partnership with D. Cook Jr of Lebanon for the purpose of carrying on a Grocery Business in the house of W. H. Lucus &amp; Co”

We have agreed to put in an equal amount of Capital &amp; divide equally the Profits &amp; Losses. Mortgaged Land for the purpose of raising means to begin on.
Cultivating no crop this year except a vegetable garden. Available hands all left except 
Bill &amp; some women and children.
4th July. Am pleased with the new avocation in which I have embarked. Find my colleugue a prompt &amp; efficient business man, think we should make money if not too much restricted by the Military regulations.
Friday July 28th 1864
→ Miss Sarah H. Lawrence commenced her mortal career 3 O clock A. M. of this day &amp; date, may she live &amp; prosper &amp; become a treasure to her Parents &amp; a useful member of Society. Dr Atchison as in the case of Risley was too late to officiate.←
Aug 1st In consequence of the desertion of my own negroes, have been compelled to hire “Contrabands” as servants &amp; am getting along first rate.
Aug 14th Grocery trade rather dull in consequence of shipments to county towns being suspended until the new order takes effect. Coffee firm at 70cents, Choice N.O. Sugar 40c, Crushed &amp; granulated 45, meal retails at $3.00 per bushel. Small Pox still prevails to some extent in the city. Geo. Shields &amp; family spending the Summer with us. Sherman is investing Atlanta &amp; Grant hammers army at Richmond with no immediate prospect of capturing either strong hold. Federals also attacking Mobile”

Sept 1st Carrying on the Grocery business, but under many disadvantages owing to the military restrictin around trade &amp; fear we can make no money. Expenses are very heavy &amp; profits short.
Dec 15th The great Battle of Nashville was fought today in which the Confederates under Gen Hood was completely overthrown by Gen Thomas. From my hill I witnessed the engagement &amp; listened to the incessant roar of the artillery the rattle of small arms &amp; the shouts of the advancing columns. The Federal lines of ranks ran transversely across my place &amp; just by my front door. Gen Beaty made his Headquarters at my house with his Staff &amp; servants occupied every room in it. A portion of the time the weather was very cold &amp; all my fencing, the work of many months of toil to me was swept away in a very few days. All my Quarter Buildings &amp; oat houses were entirely consumed &amp; all furniture that I had not moved to town was completely destroyed. I also lost all my stock, consisting of cows, horses, hogs, pigs, &amp; c. We are at present staying at Charley Thompson’s who has kindly taken us in until the excitement is over.
Dec 24th The military have left my premises &amp; Oh what an uninviting prospect is before me! All my lovely forest &amp; shade trees destroyed, my beautiful yard a mudhole &amp; ruin &amp; debris scattered all around me, nothing but the naked dwelling left &amp; yet how thankful I feel for even that little. It might have been worse”

[Page 80]

“1865.		Anno Domini 		1865.
Back home again, not the beautiful, quiet place I left a short time since, but a rugged, churless, barren, forlorn, “Black-House”. We have gone to work to make ourselves comfortable for the balance of the winter. We can keep warm at all events, as the amount of “rubbish combustible,” lying about us is considerable.
March 30th 
Have moved our Grocery stock to Wm. Lyons &amp; Co on Market Street. Have concluded to close out &amp; dissolve partnership. We have not been as fortunate in business as we had hoped we should be &amp; Groceries have tumbled upon the first prospect of Peace.
July 4th 1865 
Peace, Glorious Peace once more smiles upon our distructed Country. Swords will be sheathed &amp; the artillery cease to belch forth its distructive contents, but yet it is dreadful to reflect upon the number of Gallant Spirits that have been sacrificed in the bloody contest that I hope never to see renewed again
Dec 1865 
Have spent the Summer &amp; Fall mainly in making repairs &amp; fences around my land East of the Granny-white Pike into about 10 acre lots, which I propose to rent or lease, as under the present state of labor I cannot cultivate to my satisfaction. Much land is offered for sale &amp; lease in this county &amp; many transactions in that way take place daily. We have laid off Rokeby Place also for the purpose of renting &amp; leasing out.”</dc:relation>

Dear Husband
	I have just received a letter from you stating that you had never received more than three letters from home since you left. I cannot give any account for you not getting mine when I write every three or four days. I was very glad to hear from you and [illeg] but sorry to learn you would not be at home soon. It was quite a disappointment for I was looking for you very soon. But I had just as well quit looking. For you don’t intend coming home no more it seems. As for the news I can give you a little. All of the Colored Troops have left. Here and there is but very few that are sorry. I think we will get along very well without them. I received a paper last Saturday directed to you with a receipt in it. On opening it I found it was my favorit [sic] paper it was the Metropolitan. I was somewhat lifted up thinking you was not far off and would be at home soon. I have cribed [sic] all of my corn which is about 80 bl: Corn is selling for $8.00 per bl in the field. Polk will be from 15 to 20 cts some are asking 20 cts. Flour is selling for $6.00. You did not speak of Bro Milner’s health. His wife is very uneasy about him and wants him to come home.
	Cousin Amstead Poke’s gin house was burned and his dwelling was robed the same night. He lost a great deal of cotton and money. Mr. Maxey left last Wednesday. He took both of the girls and Charlie. Although he promised me to bring Charlie back but I don’t know whether he will or not. Jimmie is very anxious to go off and learn a traid [sic]. He is waiting for you to return so he can decide. Mr. Maxey toled [sic] him if he would come down there his board should not cost him anything. We received a letter from Lollie White that use to be and she is now in Lexington, Ky and will be out to see us as soon as she can get rested. John Tyler’s wife is dead. She has been dead 2 years but we never heard it until lately. You must in your next letter write me word what I must do. Whether I must rent out my place or whether I must keep house. I would like very much to know before it gets to [sic] late. The negroes have but all seased [sic] to do any thing for me. Osker and Mariah are still with me yet…
	You must write soon

Dear Husband

	I write you a few lines this evening as I have a good opportunity of sending it. I have not received a letter from you since you left home. I am fearful that you are sick or something has happened or you would have written before this.
	I received a letter from Tommie yesterday. It was written to you. He was not very well. He had diarhaea [sic]. He wanted a boy to wait on him. I wish you would go and see him and bring him home until he can get well.
	The conscript is taking every one now from 18 to 45. The law which exempted a man because he had 20negroes has been repealed. They all have to go now. There was two men here today on hunt for conscripts.
	It is rumored that Rosecrans has fallen back to Nashville. I suppose it is because Morgan and Wheeler have taken so many transports on the Cumberland. It was false report about the Yankees coming out to Columbia. It is filled with southern soldiers now. There is a great many sick at the hospital now.
	It is reported that Longstreet is at Shellbyville but it is not generaly [sic] believed.
	I am trying to do the best I can. I have not got any man or boy to stay with me yet nor do I think I can get one. It seems impossible for I have been trying my best and have failed.
	Tell Harriet Mariah is doing very well. Her baby is growing up fast.
	I enclose the letter Tommie wrote you. In this you can read them for yourself. Mr. Crosby sold out all of his sugar and did not let me know any thing about it so I did not get any sugar. Write as soon as you receive this for I am anxious to hear from you .

<dc:title>Correspondence from Mary Dedman to Tommie Williams, March 13, 1865</dc:title>
<dc:relation>“Selma March 13th, 1865

Dear Tommie

	I received your letter several days ago. While out at Jane’s, and would have answered it immediately, but had no writing material out there with me. Consequently had to defer writing until I came home. I received three other letters the same day I received yours, but was very much disappointed that among them was not one from my dear husband. I fear if you had witnessed the disappointment expressed by my countenance, you would have thought that your letter was not receiving a very cordial reception; but not so. I was as happy to receive it and it afforded me as much pleasure as a letter from any other person, save my husband, could have done. When I tell you that it is now more than a month since I heard from him I know you will not blame me for feeling disappointed that I did not receive a letter from his also. I was sorry to hear that you had been sick, hope you will not have the misfortune to be sick again. At least in the State of Georgia, as the people there are so little disposed to accommodate soldiers. I am glad that you and Billie succeeded in overtaking the wagons, but I think it will be some time before you reach the other portion of your command. If it is, as I suppose in front of Sherman. It is rumored that we now have Sherman in a close place and will probably capture him. But we have so many rumors that we do not know when to consider them reliable. An attack on Mobile is now threatened. There are twenty four vessels inside the bay and in sight of the city. Our authorities seem to be confidant of their ability to hold the city. God grant that they may be. For if they capture Mobile they can very easily come to Selma in their Gunboats while the river is so high. There are many inducements for them to come to this place. Among others, the release of the Yankee prisoners who are now here. We have a large number of them here. They were brought from Cahaba, in consequence of their prison being submerged with the water from the Ala. River. Before our authorities could succeed in getting boats to bring them off, the water rose several feet in the prison and they were necessarily compelled to stand in it until the Boats could come to their relief. There were several boats lying at the wharf, but they could get no wood as the freshet had washed away all the wood on the river. When this news reaches the North, I fear they will use it as a pretext for inflicting some additional cruelties on our prisoners. Many families in Selma fared as badly as they did. A great portion of East Selma was submerged and the families had to evacuate their houses.
	Last Friday was observed here by a majority of the people as a day of fasting and prayer, and I hope was so observed throughout the Confederacy. I have great faith in the efficacy of prayer and I believe God will hear and answer the prayers of His people and grant us peace with liberty and independence. It is rumored that two other Commissioners, Singleton and Hughes, have been sent from Washington to Richmond. I do not know the object of their mission. If it is to negotiate a peace, God grant that they may be successful.
	Has Willie recovered from the spell of enchantment which the Georgia young lady threw over him? She must have been very attractive or Willie very susceptible, to have been made such an easy conquest of. Did matters progress as far with them as they did with you and the sentimental young lady from whom you received that famous letter?  Tommie I am “taking  it for granted” that you are sincere when you say you do not object to long letters and am stretching this to a pretty good length. You flatter me, though, when you say you trust to gather some ideas from a correspondence with me. I am but a plain, matter of fact letter writer and do not profess to be capable of interesting those in whom I am not myself interested. Having for you the affection of a relative, I expect to write to you as such and wish I were capable of writing such letters as would be both beneficial and instructive to you. Lori says she will answer your letter in a few days. I hope to hear from both you and Willie again soon. All join me in love to you, and Bettie sends you a kiss. Write soon.
		Yours affectionately

<dc:title>Correspondence from Sarah Hamilton to Thomas &quot;Tommie&quot; H. Williams, January 25, 1863</dc:title>
<dc:relation>“January 25th, 1863

Dear Tommie

	Having an opportunity of sending you a letter I write you [a few?] lines knowing that you are always anxious to hear from home.
	I have just returned from the hospital in Columbia. I have a room there and went in to see about my patients. There is a great many sick soldiers there. Some that have their hands frost biten. [sic] They are mostly Forest’s men. I heard in town today that they were expecting the Yankees in Franklin. Whether it be true or not I can’t tell but hope it is not true for if they get here again they will ruin us. When I see so many soldiers coming home on furlough I think it is right hard that you and Jimmie can’t get home.
	Mr. Hamilton left last week. He stayed at home longer than he would have done on account of Peter. He was not willing to go south and leave his wife. Your Pa sold him to Mr. Crosby. We have bought Cary Purpose to wait on you. We heard you had three servants in your mess and did not need him but I don’t think it is true. Keep Cary to wait on you if you get sick he can wait on you.
	Your Ma W. has been very sick with a sore throat. I was in to see her yesterday. She is better. Hew Bradshaw is married. He married the widow Ford.
	Mr. Woodside was arrested the other day and sent up to Bragg. He has been in Nashville ever since the Yankees left Columbia. He came back the other day and was [paper missing] up as a spy. Report says his sentence is death.
	Billie is in the drugstore clerking for Bryen.
	I received your last letter and the papers you sent me. I read them and handed them to Alice as you requested. I would brake up housekeeping if it was not for your uncle Sam and that I expect you boys home some day. Mariah has a fine daughter. She has named it Ella Ford after Dr. Ford of Mt. Pleasant. He and his lady have been up and spent the day. He is an excellent physician. The Legislature of Indiana have met and they won’t vote another dollar nor another man to carry on this war. Report says they have troubles among themselves. Kentucky has sent a petition to Lincoln if he does not repeal his emancipation bill she will secede.
	There were [paper missing] of Forest’s men froze to death the last cold spell we had. I suppose they were neglected while standing picket. 
	I hope the Lord will protect you and spare you to return home again. Give my love to Jimmie. Tell him to write me. Jennie White sends her love to you and Jimmie. She has come up to stay awhile with me. Write every opportunity you have. Nothing more.
		Your mother

<dc:title>Correspondence from Arthur H. Harris to George Carroll Harris, January 13, 1861</dc:title>
<dc:relation>[Page 1]

“Monroe La Jany 13th 1861
My dear George
	Your letter dated at the birth of the new year reached me last night &amp; being already in your debt I have concluded to occupy a portion of this rainy Sunday in the discharge of the obligation. Your previous letter contained some remarks upon governmental affairs which I had determined to make the basis of a long letter to you. But business has delayed me &amp; as all the letters I received become the property of the little Boys as soon as they are brought into the House. Of course I am not now able to put my hand on the one above alluded to. Our state convention is to meet on the 23rd of this month &amp; as sure as the sun will rise on that day, just so sure will his beams fall upon the Pelican Flag of Louisiana floating from the dome of her Capitol. The Election of Delegates took place on the 7th inst &amp; the question came before the people in a manner which has praised the adroitness &amp; electioneering tact of many old politicians. The question of Union was never touched. All parties agreed that Louisiana ought to secede but differed as to time &amp; manner one said. We must cooperate first with our”

[Page 2]

“sister states of the south &amp; then secede. The other said we must secede first &amp; then unite with our sister states in a government.
	I took sides with the latter believing that it was the only praticable way of getting out of the difficulty. All this talk about further guaranties I believe to be a ruse practised by our Northern foes to inspire us with delusive hopes, create divisions amongst us. Lull us into repose by promising us that degrees of security which it is as much beyond their power as it is averse to their inclination to afford. Delaying our action &amp; the assertion of our right &amp; finally when it is too late for us to resist successfully. They mean to defy our power &amp; laugh at our credulity. These are reasons which have principally directed my decision upon the merits of the case. But there are others which appear to me to have equal weight upon the legal branch of the question. For instance, When the states signed the Constitution, each one for herself delegated to the Federal Government the right to declare war, to make peace, to concluded treaties, to coin money, to regulate taxation, make postal arrangements &amp;c. Now each one of these enumerated rights is a separate &amp; distinct attribute of sovereignty, without which no state nor Nation can be soverign. De facto.”

[Page 3]

“et de jure. It follows then that none of the states can take any step that will have the force of sovereign sanction so long as those delegated attributes of their sovereignty remain with the Federal Government. Their rights are of the very essence of sovereignty. Without them there is no sovereignty. How then can it be that a large party can prepare to convene the states for purposes of cooperation while they remain in the Union (an act which itself is prohibited by the very constitution under which they desire to work). While they are powerless to effect any good. While the edged tools of their sovereignty are deposited elsewhere. They propose to bind up a Southern Confederacy without having the power in their hands indispensable even to a good beginning if such a measure. They are carpenters who propose to build us a log cabin without the use of the axe, the handsaw, &amp; hammer. Let them trade first. That is my doctrine. Let them resume to themselves the power which originally they had but which now abides with the Federal Government &amp; then, clothed with all their power. Let them march to a common center. With the constitution on one hand &amp; the sword in the other. They will then be in condition to dictate the terms of adjustment &amp; not until then. Now as to the practicability of this doctrine of cooperation. First – South Carolina”

[Page 4]

“Florida &amp; Mississippi have already seceded. Alabama, Georgia &amp; Texas will soon follow their example. Now does it not strike you as nonsensical for Louisiana to refuse by her convention to stand by them &amp; still put up a pitiful prayer for cooperation? Will they not say to her that they can only treat with her as a soveriegn State? Can she with any justice demand a voice in a convention of Soveriegn states until she becomes soveriegn herself by the withdrawal of her allegiance to the government of the United States? – The fact is they will have nothing to do with her. Louisiana must go out on the 23rd inst. I would rather see her expose herself to danger by taking a manly part than see security in the path of the laggard. The fact is we are surrounded by dangers, but those which stare us immediately in the face tho’ they be sufficient to appal us for the moment are shorn of their tirrant when we peer into the future, not far distant, &amp; behold the storm which is gathering to overwhelm us if we do not now push forward to some haven of safety. The contest must be fought out now &amp; I should never die contented if I thought it would be written on my epitaph  -- “here lies one who”

[Page 5]

“shrunk from his duty to his little ones. Because it required him to face danger &amp; death &amp; die at last. Bearing them to endure the worst of all calamities which he could have avoided” – Are we of the present day willing that our posterity should speak thus of us? Like you, I have been raised to entertain a sort of respectful &amp; affectionate awe for the Union. Which for a long while has induced me to frown upon the bare idea of its dismemberment. But the time for Romance upon the subject of the Union has past. The history of her glories achieved as they have been in legislative halls &amp; on the bloody fields of battle. Upon distant seas &amp; in the halls of diplomacy. Will be read with admiration &amp; wonder. As long as the English language exists. But we know that our posterity will not look into it with pleasure or pride if we fail to arrest the government in the onslaught which she is about to make upon the equality of the South in the Union. I fear we have already given just ground of complaint upon the part of those who are to follow us on the stage of life. For the last 10 years the administration of the government has cast 60 million annually. The South has uniformly contributed 40 million &amp; the North 20 towards it. While”

[Page 6]

“in return the South has received 20 &amp; the North 40 millions annually. Leaving a balance of 20 millions which we pay to the North annually for the privelege of living under the same government. Which they on the contrary instead of being glad to have such profitable brethren have waged a successful warfare upon the institution which is our life &amp; existence. Again Mr. Debon has calculated that in allowing the North to manufacture a large portion of our raw material into fabric for our use we virtually allow his a loan of 100 millions of your capital annually. Now when we shall have cut loose our connection with him we shall have accomplished the two fold object of securing the permanency of our institutions on the one hand &amp; keeping at home 120 millions annually for the benefit of armselars &amp; not our enemies, on the other. Do you not think that posterity will thank us as much for the one as the other? That drain upon the profits of our industry has enriched the North heretofore. When it is withdrawn from them &amp; scattered amongst ourselves. Can your imagination picture what a lovely &amp; thriving nation the Southern Confederacy will be? Some have doubted the possibility of forming a Southern Confederacy. But I am satisfied it will be done &amp; that speedily. Those States”

[Page 7]

“which have gone out have all appointed Delegates to a Southern Convention &amp; invited all the other Southern states to unite with them in the formation of a Confederacy. So that the regret you seemed to feel at the prospect of our dividing “E uno multi” I think has not a sound basis. You say further you are “not for the Union as it is”, that in sentiment it is already dismembered &amp; you think too that a renewal of the nuptial vow under the constitution will be sufficient. I fear that betrayed on your part some with want of information as to the material which goes to make up the voting people of the North. Man ought to recollect that those people have given themselves up to the very worst kind of fanaticism. That that is based upon &amp; originates out of a religious prejudice and that they even teach their children as soon as they understand language to hate us &amp; our institutions. &amp; that their animosity against us is as firm &amp; deeply seated in their bosoms as the attachment for the government has been in yours &amp; mine. So long as they continue to enjoy peace &amp; plenty at the expense of the South just so long will they continue to wage war upon &amp; insult us. We cannot hope to change their public sentiment against us until they have been taught by starvation &amp; suffering to appreciate the value of our institutions both to ourselves &amp; to theirs.”

[Page 8]

“And yet, without that change what earthly security or guaranty could they give that would or ought to be relied upon by an outraged &amp; gallant Southern people. The single fact that one of the Federal laws has been repudiated by them does not amount to much. That is only one of the manifestations of their deep seated hostility to us. It is the hostility itself which we have just cause to complain of &amp; be alarmed at. Seeing that the people who entertain it have now the government under their control. According to the text from which the celebrated Dr. Palmer preached a secession sermon on Thanksgiving day “Shall the Throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?” I must send you that sermon when I can get a copy. It is grand. I believe that the only way to make friends of our enemies is to secede from them promptly &amp; boldly say to them we will have no fellowship with them so long as that sentiment or hostility exists against us. When our political ties are surrendered they will begin to feel the importance of being friendly &amp; the silence of their once busy workshops will teach them the value of our friendship. Then they may make up their minds that we are a gallant people instead of a band of barbarians &amp; respect us accordingly but not until then.”

[Page 9]

“—9—
I am astonished to find that I have filled 8 pages upon the subject of secession. My apology for being so lengthy is that nowadays I find myself acting with men who have heretofore am against me in party line &amp; it has occasioned some remark amongst my former political friends. Many of whom have not the patience to listen to the reasoning by which I arrive at my conclusions. Pa for instance. Talk to him about dissolving the Union &amp; he gets to restless to listen. Gets downright mad. I think I could convince him I am right if he would divest himself of prejudice &amp; listen for ½ hour. Louisiana is my home. What little interest I own is identified with her. Ohi is the native state of my brave little boys &amp; if she now flashes in the pan I shall be outdone completely. But I have confidence in her. I look upon the great seal of Louisiana &amp; there I find the representation of a Pelican hovering over her nest &amp; finding her eager &amp; trusting brood. She is the State of Louisiana hovering over, protecting &amp; nourishing her children &amp; may in present proud arms be buried with the romance of her early Spanish existence if she fails to do it nobly. I would rather she should be a cemetery of freemen than the home of a degenerate brow beaten race of slaves. I am afraid you are bored.”

[Page 10]

“But as old Grymes [?], the celebrated Civil lawyer once remarked in the Supreme Court in Norman when he was interrupted by the Chief Justice “may it please your Honor, I am informed that truth lies at the bottom of a well &amp; can only be arrived at by boring” I have endeavored to be brief in the expression of my views &amp; hope you may find them entertaining, if not instructive.
	Sallie &amp; the Boys are well. The little rascals have been romping around me ever since I sat down here, pulling my hair, grabbing at my pipe, riding my foot, throwing the cat on me, mashing potatoes on my head &amp; in fact making themselves particularly busy in giving me a variety of annoyance. Lawrence now has the foot tub for a Steam Boat plying between two points in the house designated on his schedule as De Thitty &amp; Monroe, stopping at various intermediate points. His cargo being altogether imaginary consists principally of confectionaries. They are both growing very fast.
	I have been quite busy since about the middle of November. Having consented to accept the office of magistrate in Monroe my court has been crowded with business both of a Civil &amp; Criminal nature. Tomorrow I am to hold a Community Court over a young man who killed an Irishman last week”

[Page 11]

“We heard from Waco last week. They were all well, but as usual rightly down in the mouth about short crop &amp; short prices. We dont know when to look for them up. The last letter they got from you included the deepest sympathy with you on account of your matrimonial troubles. When I was down there I had to answer a good many questions from old Aunt Mary on that subject. Considering I didnt know any thing about it. She requested me to say to you when next I should write that she “thought it was all talk”. But I did not understand from her the reasoning by which she arrived at that conclusion. You must correspond with her in relation to it for further information.
	Sally unites with me in love to you &amp; now Sir I will excuse you from reading further. Take a long breath &amp; write me down.

<dc:description>This nine-page letter written from Arthur H. Harris in Monroe, Louisiana, to his brother George Carroll Harris in Nashville is a conscious political treatise. The author is advocating and justifiying the secession of Louisiana at the upcoming convention on January 23 and then the joining of the state with sister states in a confederacy. He notes the South's disproportionate contribution to the nation's wealth and the disrespect shown their institutions. Secession is his answer, and violence will follow.</dc:description>

	“Waco Place Saty 4th. May 61
My Dear George,
	The dire pestilence war is upon us with all its terrible prospects of abundant blood. I, like old Va, held on the old ship, but not so long, until it became evident the Nt. had determined to do nothing but tantelize &amp; defy us. Thus, giving up all hope of a satisfactory adjustment. I some time ago, not only felt willing to give up the union as it was , but really ambitionus to punish our enemies. When the Sumpter affair broke out, I dashed up to Monroe for the express purpose of endeavoring to disuade Arthur from going now. It was three days before he yielded, &amp; then reluctantly told him, for the present, it was not certain he would be needed.

All my accts up here are harrassing me distressingly while I am utterly powerless. Myelle annoying me more than any. I owe him some $5,500. Heretofore, I have always handed him what ever monies he asked. Now he knows it can’t be had. He is down upon me without mercy. It is getting up a bad feeling between us. &amp; if he persists, would not be surprised if we part soon. Those of his acts, which I’ve not paid, I have assumed. Now requires me to secure the safety of his debt to him. It looks a little strange that $100,000 worth of property is’nt good against his &amp; other debts we owe. But he is ignorant, timid &amp; suspicious. Our crop is all planted, good stand cotton, corn not all up. 340 in cotton &amp; 150 in corn, making 17 acres to the hand. Large crop, abundance of heavy rains. Raining terribly now. Lost two mules lately, &amp; a third stolen.

<dc:description>Two-page letter from  Elisha W. Harris to his son George Carroll Harris of Nashville. He writes from his plantation Waco Place in Louisiana of the war being upon them with bloody consequence. He has abandoned his efforts to cling to the union and now seeks to punish enemies. He mentions the firing on Fort Sumter spurring on family to enlist, the scarcity of currency, the suspension of business, money problems with his plantation overseer, absentee planters, and the running away of a slave.</dc:description>

				“Monroe La. June 21st 61

Dear George
	Your telegraphic dispatch of the 15th was not received until a moment ago. Owing to my absence from home for the past week. I have been off on another recruiting expedition &amp; have just returned to Town, dirty, dusty, &amp; tired. I will therefore reply briefly to your enquiries &amp; go home for a bath &amp; a light colored linen. However I rather think that the information you seek was given in a letter I mailed to you about 10 days since. &amp; it ought to have reached you by this time. If not within a day or two after your dispatch was sent off. Mike is in the 2nd Louisiana Regt. under the Command of Col De.Russy of Red River. They were stationed at Yorktown Va at last account &amp; eager for a fuss of some kind or other. The cannons firing at Great Bethel were heard by the boys at Yorktown (10 miles distant) &amp; they immediately hurried on there in double quick time but did not arrive at the battle ground until about an hour after the fun was all over. They hate it very much”

[Page 2]

“As to the Chaplaincey. There is no prospect of forming the Regt here to which I alluded in a former letter. At the time I wrote I was confident the project would go through like a flash &amp; I was anxious to get you in the same Regt with me. But as you cannot be with me I would like for you to be with Mike &amp; my impression is that that Regt has no Chaplain. However if that place is filled dont be in a hurry. We are going to have a long war! Many new Regts will yet have to be formed. I shall be in some one of them &amp; will put your name forward then if you are not engaged. Dont be in too much haste to accept the position among entire strangers. I am getting along slowly but surely with my Rifle Company. Am not in too much hurry. Because I am satisfied those fanatics of the North will be fools enough to give us all a chance. They intend to annoy &amp; harass us for years. I wont say fight us, because I believe that the cowardly set will run every time after they have had 2 or 3 good dressings down. I know we can whip the infernal rascals &amp; drive them back to the mysterious caverns of Yankeedom &amp; we must do it at the risk of all that is dear to us. Adieu

George Carroll Harris would secure a posotion as Chaplain in the Confederate Army in 1862.</dc:description>

Feby 28th 1862
Honl John J. Crittenton

		City
			Dear Sir:
					Genl Buels Division of the Army has been in and round this city for several days. My heart is sincerely rejoiced that it reached and occupied the city and county without the necessity of sheding one drop of the blood of one of our citizens. The approach of his army was greatly feared by many of our citizens, some of the prominent ones fled the state. Then however wise comparatively small, the great body of the people remained, and in afords me unspeakable pleasure to say, that the conduct of the army has been such as to raise the admiration of both the friends and former enemys of the Union. I can say in all candor, that I have never in all my life, seen such a revolution in public sentiment, in so short a time. The high toned conduct of the officers – the just appreciation of and observance of the private rights and property of the people upon the part of the whole army, is the theme of all conversations. And must if continued (of which I have not doubt) win the state back to its allegence to the Union.
	Now Govn. what I want to say to you &amp; which which the object of this communication. If the government, should feel it to be its duty (as it may ultimately be) to make us a provisional”

[Page 2]

“government, ask them to give us time for this revolution to become full throughout and complete before that be done. It is now working gloriously and a little more time to enable Genl Buel to disabuse the public mind as to the objects and purposes of his government, will in my opinion do more to win the state back than any battle he has or may win and I am not sure that if Tennessee takes the cause now indicating and to the extent I supose it will that there will not be many more battles, and the slaughter of our citizens and friends will thereby be stayed, a consumation devoutly to be desired by every Christian.
	I will not attempt to infer[?] these suggestions by argument. The reasons will present themself to your mind at once. And better ones than I could give.
	I parted with your son Gen. Thomas Crittenden minutes since he has been in good health and is general very well, but desired me to say that he had a slight derangement of the bowels and was on that account relieved from duty today, but would be all right by tomorrow.
	I need not undertake to give you the history of the army and the battles recently[?] in this state as you will have heard it from headquarters before this reaches you.
	Gen will you give me from time time to time the news of the government as to these states. You see I regard the whole as virtually evident for which I do sincerely thank God.”

“Allow me to thank you personally for what you have done towards the solution of this country.
I am not sure that this solution will in after years, be rejected by the lovers of good government. For the reason that it will have established an important fact. That the Government of the limited states had and has an inherant power to sustain itself.

						March 12th 1864
Hon. John S. Brien.
		Dear Sir,
			Though we have never met yet I think I know you.
You have been represented to me by a gentleman of high legal and literary attainment, as one of the first legal minds in the United States. My purpose in writing to you at present is to lay before you the condition of my affairs and to ask you legal advice.
	When the United States forces came into and occupied this state my estate was worth over two hundred thousand dollars unimcumbered not owing a dollar to any one.
	While Genl Grant’s army was besieging the City of Vicksburg during the months of June and July last they took every thing I possessed on earth that they could get in their possession – provisions, horses, mules, stock of every kind, forage, grain, nearly one hundred negroes, burned my residence, Gin, mill, stables, all my out buildings except a few negro houses, left the plantation in such a perfect wreck that it is impossible to occupy it. 
	My cash ballance is something over twenty five thousand dollars in what I conceive to be good hands but not available at present, and may not be until the end of the war.
	So far as my claims on the government of the United States are concerned, nothing can”

“be done here There is no Court of Claims established in this state nor do I see any prospect of such a Court being organized here or any future time.
	Can my claim be laid before the Court at Nashville to a successful termination, think you. Or can you do anything in a legal power of view to assist us to gather something out of the wreck of our fortune?
	I have taken no part in the rebellion, but have remained a non Combattant tacitly at home as long as I have one.
	I have been a successful Physician, can make a living any where, if there is anything to do in that way, but here all is gone that makes life bearable – turn the eye in whatever direction you may, desolation marks every spot. Meet whom you may, distress marks every feature the fiery element has left but few homes untouched but few spots unblackened, robery, outrage and murder are of daily occurance. I drop[?] the scene on this  dark dream of life.

December 12th. 1863
Saturday Night
My own, dear, sweet, wife:
	I wrote you a few days ago a long letter and directed it to care of Mr. Russel Houston, Nashville, I trust you have or will receive it. I write to-night, hastily, on business which if my wishes and directions are executed will place in your hands a “Christmas present”  more acceptable than any you ever found hid in you tiny stockings.
	I have directed Mr. Daniel Shepherd, a planter on this river, to deposit with Mr. W. S. Picket (of the firm Picket, Moomeby &amp; Co of Memphis) Fifteen Thousand dollars in U. S.

If there be any delay write to Pickett and send some safe person for the money.
	Now first thing I wish you to do is to get Mr. Park to act as your agent. You should have confidence in Mr. P’s integrity and business qualifications and I believe he would”

“aid you. His judgment about property is good and he is an excellent trader.
	After supplying yourself &amp; mother liberally I wish you to invest the balance in a home or in real estate of some kind. I prefer the old “homestead” and if your mother will sell, buy it. If she refuses to sell then buy out Milkes and Hughes or wherever else you can make a good investment. Consult Mr. Park and get him to invest it for you. Perhaps it might be best to invest it in a good &amp; desirable farm somewhere around Columbia. My object is in these times to secure a home or property which can be hereafter converted into one. It will not do to hold “Greenbacks” too long as they will become greatly depreciated and in the end perhaps worthless.
	When you buy have the property conveyed to a Trustee (your mother or Mr. Park) for your use &amp; benefit and such children as you  have by me. Let the deed contain the power to change the investment whenever you &amp; I many desire it. Be certain to have this clause in the deed as it is highly probable we will wish to sell the property when we have peace and invest in another piece of”

“property more agreeable to our tastes and necessities. You have my idea. Tell Mr. Park to have the papers drawn so as to carry them out as nearly as possible. This you will regard as in lieu of that provision in my will providing for a home for you; and as securing to you, as far as it goes, the property given you by your father. It is probable I will make you another remittance before very long. If I do you will invest it in same manner with this.

I hope to realise something more.
	It is hard after a life-time of toil to see a splendid fortune wrecked and nothing but a few fragments saved. I trust you will husband with care and judment the little saved for you.
	My darling, I have no news to write. My heart is filled with sadness and anguish and my mind with anxiety and troubles. Not one word from you &amp; my dear children since I left you in August!!! And then the seperation. How long, how long, is it to last. The last few months have added 10 years to my life. Many more such will make me an old man. Lonley &amp; sad. What a life of anxiety &amp; trouble.”

“For your sake and that of my dear children I will endeavor to be cheerful &amp; happy. Pardon me for having given away one moment to my feelings. I hope you are always cheerful &amp; happy and that you  take a plenty of exercuse. Now that you are “full-handed” visit your friends.

Nothing “contraband”. Mr. Shepherd will remain in Memphis ten days.

<dc:description>Joseph Gerald Branch managed two plantations in Desha County, Arkansas, from 1859-1867.  His concern about the U.S. Treasury notes was warranted: the notes did experience some inflation during the Civil War period,  but nothing comparable to the extreme depreciation of Confederate currency.  In the course of U.S. history, the price inflation experienced in the South during the Civil War ranks second only to that of  the American Revolution.</dc:description>

“Davis Lake. Jany 28th 1864
My own darling wife: -- 
	I have just heard that a neighbor will start to Memphis in the morning and with a few lines hastly, not knowing whether they will ever reach you.
	In December I wrote two letters to you and one to Mr. Martin &amp; sent them to Memphis to be forwarded. I have been informed they were sent to Nashville to Mr. Houston, as they were letters of importance I am anxious to know whether you or Mr. Martin ever received them. Has the money ever been sent to you or Mr. Martin. My instructions were that the amount be equally divided between you. I have some fears that the amt has not been sent from Memphis as directed. If it has not, have Mr. Claiborne Deloach (of the House of Apperson &amp; Deloach) &amp; Mr. Pickett written to on the subject. Mr. Deloach can fully inform you. There is still on hand a large quantity of and I hope to be able to make you another remittance.”

[Page 2]

“I am still without an overseer on either place and of course much harrassed &amp; troubled. Mr. Morrow I hope will return before long from Texas whither I sent him in December with about 30 negroes &amp; clothing &amp;c&amp;c. The negroes here are doing very well. None of them have left as yet. I am making my arrangements to make a crop hoping they will remain with me.
	I have no news to write as I never see a newspaper or see any one who knows more that myself. I endeavor to hear with fortitude the desolation which is sweeping over our poor country. Is there no statesman, North or South, who rising above the angry waves of party prejudice &amp; national animositis, can calm the raging storm?
	I have not heard a word from you or my children either directly or indirectly since I left you in August!!!. I have not language to express my feelings of anxiety and anguish. What can I do? What shall I do? Is there no way of hearing from you? Can you not get a letter to Memphis for me directed”

[Page 3]

“to care of Mr. C. DeLoach or Pickett. You perhaps had better send it to care of Mr. Claiborne DeLoach. He has frequent opportunities of sending it to me.
	The money which I remit to you I want you to use as I requested in my letters in Dec. I am trying very hard to sell something and I trust you will act with judgment. Do not hesitate or delay to do as I requested you. I am anxious for you to secure your Mother’s place. Tell Mr. Martin to write me fully about those papers, if she could do anything. Have they ever been sent to Little Rock or has she been able to do anything?
	I expect to remain here as long as I can do any good and until I hear from you. My own dear sweet wife! My heart is always with you. Not an hour passes but your trials are the subject of my thoughts. How I long to be with you as your time approaches. Do not give away to feelings of despondency, but be cheerful &amp; happy. Firmness &amp; nerve in the hour of trial will take away or alleviate many a rain.
	The uncertainty of how long our seperation will”

[Page 4]

“will continue overpowers me and my life seems to be a blank. Do write me your news how we are to manage to be restored to each other ever more. Can you come to me? Or can I, or must I, come to you? Write fully. Kiss my dear children for me &amp; do not let them forget they have a father who loves them as few parents love. I hope George &amp; Henry are studying &amp; improving themselves. Above all things, except being christians, I desire them to be educated gentlemen. Give my love to your our Mother, Pah &amp; also Mr. Martin &amp; family.
S	When you write direct your letter to care of Claiborne DeLoach at Memphis &amp; to care of Mr. Hudson, or D. Shepherd, on Arkansas River. Mr. Hudson lives on Col Barber’s place &amp; will take the trouble to send me the letter.
	I am exceedingly anxious to open a way of communication between us &amp; will wait with impatience to hear. When then this reaches you. I have heard nothing from Cad Catheby. Tell Irome Pillow to come to see me when he comes to Helena.
	I suppose Mr. Martin will be unable to visit the plantation. I wrote her fully about Mother here in Dec.
Good night.

					“Davis Lake – March 16th 1864
My Dear Sweet Wife: -
	I have written you several letters and sent them to Memphis to be mailed to you at Columbia, care of Mr. Houston Nashville – but I do not know that any of them have ever reached you – I do not know whether this will ever reach you, but I will write a few lines hoping perchance it may-
I have not heard one word from you or Columbia since I left there – A heavy cloud of the thickest blackness seem to hang between us, impervious to every ray of communication – It almost drives me mad – I cannot and will not stand it much longer  - What is property on anything else compared to one’s family? If I could only get one word that you were well &amp; happy &amp; that my children were also well, it would be the greatest relief to me – This long &amp; awful silence overpowers me with doubt, uncertainty and the deepest anxiety – Have you received my letters? If you have could you not send a letter to Memphis for me to – care of Pickett or Mr. C. DeLoach – Either would send it to me as there is frequent passing between here &amp; Memphis – If in no other way could you not send some one specially to bring it? – If I do not hear from you in a short time, you”

[Page 2]

“will see me regardless of consequences – 
I have succeeded in employing Mr. Arnold to take charge of this place and the negroes, I think, will remain here – not one has left as yet and they work some, or perhaps tolerably well under the circumstances – I am preparing to plant a crop both of corn and cotton on both pieces and if let alone by the Confederates expect to make 350 or 400 Bales of cotton – 
Early last November I made arrangements with a man named Shepard to send you and Mr. Martin ample funds and to write you – He has however failed to send you the money and I am now trying to make another arrangement with Mr. Hudson to let him have the cotton if he will send you &amp; Mr. Martin the money – I have directed him to deposit it with Mr. W. S. Pickett of Memphis – If he complies &amp; he sends you the money invest it in a residence or home for yourself – If your mother will sell her place buy it – I prefer it to any other – If she will sell tell her she can keep it so long as she lives or desires – have the Will made out to you  &amp; your children – 
Since I left you my life has been exceedingly hard &amp; disagreeable – full of troubles &amp; anxieties – “

[Page 3]

“The negroes have behaved so well that I feel that I ought to be happier and more thankful – But to be isolated, cutoff from every so social enjoyment, and not know which moment every thing around me may be destroyed by Jay hawkers on one side or the other – To be in constant dread of every thing, has nearly harrassed my life out of me – I am here between the two armies with only the bad &amp; ricious, left in the neighborhood – Who generally are ready to aid  &amp; assist the soldiers in any wicked or mean thieving or robbing [expeditions?] – I have not yet been molested personally, but i have been jay hawked in way of stock until I am used to it – My purse nor my watch have been yet demanded but I do not know at what moment day or night they may be – 
Why has not Mrs. Martin written me? – I do not know whether her papers have ever been sent to Genl Sheets at Little Rock – 
My thoughts constantly run on you and your situation and you approaching troubles – Oh darhling! My heart longs to be with you when that time comes be firm, patient &amp; courageous – Recollect to be “a hen in the strife” – If the lord spares you, we will”

[Page 4]

“be together in a short time thereafter at any rate – for either I will go to you or you shall come to me – As soon as I can fix up the business here on a safe basis I will leave and then you will hear from me wherever I may go and you can join me in visiting sister or Lainy’s family – If I can do so (and you can 	judge) I will visit Columbia – How would that suit you? Write me your views that I may act understandingly. – 
I do hope my boys are going to school and improving their opportunities – Tell them nothing will please me more than to find they study and improve themselves – Give my love to them &amp; Mrs Martin’s family – 
Has my daughter &amp; my little Lawrence forgotten they have a father – kiss them for me – 
Give my love and best love to your Mother &amp; Pet – Tell the old lady I often wish I could be with her – I have not seen or heard from Cad – 
In conclusion do try to get a letter to me – Send it to Memphis to care of some friend to be sent to Mr. Hudson or George Sexton [?] on Arkansas River for me – They go to the Gun boat at mouth of White River every day – 
James &amp; family are here &amp; well.

	Mary was not confined until the 28th of July and she is not able to start yet. We are preparing and Providence permitting we will start the 3rd of Sept. and as we cannot travel at night, we will be home about the middle of the month Our child is a daughter, healthy  and growing finely, Everybody”

“Monday morning 19th, All well Mary improving &amp; baby growing like a young gosling. Just 3 weeks old &amp; weighs 9 lbs 10 oz. The nurse is gone &amp; I have taken her place at night and let Mary sleep. I get sleeping about half the night. Will leave providence permitting two weeks from tomorrow.

Boston Aug 17th /61
My Dear Mother
	As channels of communication have been opened I send by two, in order if possible to let you know how we are &amp; that we will start for home as soon as the 3rd of Sept. Mary cannot travel before that time.
	On the 15th (last Thursday) I received a letter from Samuel dated July 17th and containing the sad intelligence of Fathers sever illness; although I have been anxious to get home, and wait with a good deal of impatience, his letter has increased my anxiety: But the time will soon roll around. As soon as the child was born, I wrote by Adanis”

[Page 2]

“and hope you have received it. I would have written oftener and sooner had I known that letters were carried through. I hope to hear from you again before I leave. Mary has got along as well as we could possibly expect. She has been up nearly a week. Her health improved up to the day she was taken sick, and she was stronger and better than she had been any time after the attack of Asthma last fall. She has a good constitution, and if I can only get her to Tenn. I have no fears for her health. The babe, Eleanor Gregg, grows finely and is getting fat, it was poor when born. Mary’s desires in regard to it have all ben realized but one. She wanted it should have black hair &amp; eyes &amp; look just like me in this she has been gratified. But in its”

“sex she has been disappointed as she desired a son. I am now making boxes for packing our goods &amp; chattles. We cannot take them along, but I want to pack them myself, So that I may know that it is well done. We will have two very large trunks and will take all we can in them. I will resign my place the last of this month. We are supplying ourselves with clothing, and by the time we get home we will not have very much money left; but will be out of debt almost, and can have an even start. If my dear Father still lives; tell him that, if God in His providence permits &amp; our lives are spared in a month or 6 weeks he  shall see me; for if anything should happen to prevent Mary from going, I will go alone:
	My health is good and has”

“been nearly all the time since I have been here.
	Mother Silsby sends her love to you. She is grieving at the prospect of parting with her children. From anxiety she manifests about me she evidently looks upon me as one of her own and she is in ecstacies over her little grand-daughter. The battle at Bull Run has cast a gloom over the north and had an effect upon the people similar to that of thrusting a stick into a beehive upon its inmates. They are claiming a victory at Springfield Mo. But there is very little said about it, and the particulars are kept back so much, that a great many are convinced that it was anything but a victory. They represent the forces of the Confederacy as numbering 23,000 &amp; the federals at 5,500. Quite a difference. Mary &amp; the baby join me in love to you all

“Dyersburg Tenn June 28th ‘61
My dear, dear husband,
	I received your letter by Mr. Watkins – I was just at my breakfast this morning when your last by Maj. Fowlkes came – you may be sure. I made a hasty meal of it - . Your letters are all I look for with any eagerness – not having you to look for. They come nearer supplying your place than any thing else. &amp; you cannot write too often. You must not be disappointed if you do not get one from me by every one passing, for I do not know if their going to Randolph. You know we live so far in the country, we do not hear much that is going on in town. I do not know how I will send [missing] but I must write at [missing] to chance, for an opportunity [missing]”

“We are getting along as well &amp; comfortably as usual, and only need your dear presence, to make us happy. But oh! We miss you so much, &amp; my anxiety is so great for you, that you are never one moment from my mind. And though I know God is able to protect you, where ever you are, still I cannot feel that “you will be as safe in the battlefield as in your peaceful home.” My only hope now is, that something will be done in Congress to still the tempest that is now threatening us, before it burst upon us with all its fury, and leaves thousands of hearts and homes desolate. I am rejoiced to hear that you are getting along so pleasantly – for it would be an additional trouble to me to know you were not comfortably situated – I understand that several of your company returned. How were they received:
	I had just put up my letter to go to the kitchen, &amp; mix”

The uniform will be sent to the river in the morning. &amp; I am sending you a box of edibles – I don’t know that it will be any better than you get. But will show that you are still thought of at home.
	Father and Mother are still very feeble, but are better than when you left. Johnnies old cough has returned on him. I am very uneasy about it – He is very well with that exception – Katie face appears to be entirely well, but it may break out again at any time.

“such a fine, lively girl, that she will be good company for Cousin Beck – for she can talk equally as fast – I will have to answer all your questions about home in one – every thing is getting along tolerably well. – The weather is so dry that our vegetables are suffering very much. You inquired about your bus. Mr. Howe had just finished taking a box to send you when your letter came. This is the second box that we have taken, it is not so nice as the first. I had intended writing you a good long letter in return for yours on Sunday – but Mr. Ledsinger has spoiled it all - &amp; I am so hurried I hardly know what I am writing.

“Dyersburg Tenn Aug 19th 1861
My own dear husband - ,
	We returned home with lightened hearts. Thinking that our noble Tennessee troops had been ordered to a safe retreat. Where we earnestly hoped they would have to remain. But our joy was suddenly turned into disappointment when the unwelcome tidings reached us the next day that you had been ordered back to New Madrid. I was flattering myself that if you remained at Randolph, you would be at home often – Now I have no hope of seeing you until the campaign closes. Which God grant may be soon, for this state of uncertainty and suspense is enough to wear away the stoutest hearts. &amp; though I try to meet it as bravely as possible, &amp; hope that all may yet be well. There are times when I feel as if I cannot endure it to the”

“end. It is some comfort to know you are meeting your troubles with so much spirit &amp; bravery. &amp; I can only trust to the God of battles to be with you in your trials.
	Mrs. Prince arrived yesterday. With your precious letter. I was at church. (Mr. Hall’s) when I saw her drive through town. I could scarcely curb my impatience, to remain in the church &amp; the sermon fell on a heedless ear. I thought I never heard such a long tiresome sermon. When I got home your letter was waiting me. &amp; never was so anxious to know whether you had got well or not. You would consider yourself of considerable importance if you knew how many wretched moments you cause me. Our trip home from Booth’s Point was as you anticipated a very unpleasant one. The morning broke upon us cloudy &amp; dull. &amp; after waiting two or three hours for Dr. McGaughey to visit a sick man”

[Page 3]

“we turned our faces homeward with the pleasant expectation of travelling home through a heavy rain. This however was escaped with only a slight shower, when a worse trouble arose. Dr. Mc. mule refused to go. After waiting about an hour &amp; half on him to get his mule exchanged, we started again. Got a mile or two from the river, when the Dr. got frightened again with his horse. After making  another exchange, which detained us an hour longer, we again started, arrived at home about three o’clock. Found all as well as usual, except Vickie. She was much worse while we were away. &amp; was still very bad when we got home. She has been improving for the last week though her mind is still as weak as a childs. I have but small hopes that she will entirely recover. You cannot realize what a sad thing it is to look upon such a wreck. She hangs upon me as Johnnie or Kate would do.”

“expecting the same caresses, &amp; the same treatment as I give them. “Sister Mary” is constantly on her tongue. &amp; must be all that is on her mind. Poor little Johnnie has paid dearly for his trip to see Pa. He has been very sick since he came home. He had high fever when we got home. &amp; it never abated for three or four days. Today is the first day he has been without fever. It is well you cannot see his dear little pale face, for it would haunt you all through the wars. He was not satisfied with his visit. He said he did not see his Pa enough, &amp; he wants you to come home. We have some fears tonight that Kate will be sick, as she is now asleep, &amp; with high fever on her. I have been trying to nurse them all well again, so that if there was the least possible chance of getting to see you again, I would make the attempt for like Johnnie I did not get to see you half enough.

“Dyersburg Tenn.
Aug 26 1861.
My dear husband -.
	I wrote you by Mr. Nash, but as he did not go as far as New Madrid, I do not know whether you received my letter or not – if you did not, you missed a rich treat. There was one from myself, &amp; enclosed was one from John to Mother. Cousin Beck also wrote the same time. I have not received your last, by Mr. Chitwood. &amp; of course I am in a perfect fever about it. Mr. C. gave it to Mr. Nash to bring home. &amp; report says he got tight &amp; left his saddle-bag on the road.
	It has been a long dull Sunday, &amp; have thought so much of you today, that I concluded to try &amp; relieve my thoughts by writing to you. I wonder where you are &amp; what you are doing this evening. I would”

Those that are dearest to us on earth are gone we know not where, &amp; no probability of hearing from them soon- I suppose this will be my last opportunity of writing, &amp; though I have nothing at all to write, I could not let it pass without letting you know that your darling little Johnnie has gotten almost well, &amp; Kate as well &amp; bad as usual. The rest of us are all well, except Vickie – she does not improve any - &amp; I very much fear never will. She will be a great charge on my hands, for she is not as capable of taking care of herself as Johnny is. But she is my sister, &amp; I will try to do my best by her. Though it is a sad charge. Mother is away today – spending the day with Mrs. Jakes -  other [?] has another daughter - &amp; Mother’s services as usual were called into requisition. She calls it Lucy Ellen. Through compliment to Mother.”

“Cousin Beck seems to be enjoying herself finely. Dr. Hibbitt called this evening &amp; from the way their tongues are running they have plenty to talk about. I am glad he called. With the exception of Mr. Hanks she has had no other visitor since she came. &amp; I am afraid her visit this summer has not been pleasant enough to induce her to come back.
	Sunday night – steals on me almost unawares &amp; cast a shadow on my heart as well as on the earth. The heavy pattering of the rain, causes me to think of you poor soldiers, who are probably exposed to it tonight, with no dry place to lay your heads. &amp; I feel as if I would so willingly exchange places with you if I only could. But alas, &amp; alas, I am only a woman, &amp; must enjoy the comforts, with which your hand has so fairly provided, and cannot share with you the privations &amp; hardships you endure.

“description of her visit. She seemed to enjoy it very much although she did have a sick husband to nurse. I was gratified to hear her report of you all being in good spirits it was one of my greatest troubles when I was there. I fancied you all looked very gloomy. Perhaps it was only because I felt so myself. How do you like your experience in marching so far? Didn’t you get terribly tired. I feel so spoiled when I see this great fat horse of yours standing around doing nothing &amp; you tramping on foot through mud &amp; water with those dear old long legs aching in every bone. I have been thinking seriously about sending him to you, but the uncertainty of you getting him &amp; not knowing whether you would like it. I will wait for orders from head quarters before I venture. Cousin Beck sends his love, &amp; says she will not bore you with a letter this time. I suppose she thinks mine will be as much as you can get through with. But I guess she is mistaken for I know my letters are interesting. 
If there is not much sense in them, because they are from home. I will still hope to hear from you frequently though from all accounts, it seems I have but a slender foundation to build a hope upon.

My dear husband – 
	I had began to be dreadfully anxious to hear from. &amp; had almost concluded to write you a second letter, when I received yours of the 18th by last Monday’s mail. You have never been so long writing before, &amp; did not know what to think of it. Never dreaming you were indulging in a feeling of pique [?] because I had not written sooner when you know you can’t possibly be as anxious to hear from me as I am from you. Don’t do so any more or I shall have to scold you &amp; you know I am a second Han [?] tippe for scolding. Be thankful I am that I have those dear little children for you to think about so much as only to find consolation in writing. As well indeed as they are my only consolation in separation from you. Kate”

He has got as far as “baker”: &amp; is so proud of it that he told me I must tell you when I wrote. &amp; I expect Pa will be equally proud to hear it.
	I am glad to hear you have your winter quarters up &amp; I know I shall enjoy your nice log cabin as much as you will. For instead of picturing you, sitting by an open fire exposed to all the inclemency’s of weather I can now have the satisfaction of knowing you are secure from the cold, the wind &amp; rain. &amp; if I could be equally sure that you were safe from the Lincolnites, I would be satisfied.

For I do not know that when you have it in your power, you are arbitrary &amp; tyrannical, but just the best &amp; dearest man in the world. Though it is your wife that says it. I almost felt like crying when you gave me so little encouragement to look for you Christmas. Like yourself I do not want you to come home without a furlough. For I think is a bad example for a Capt. to set. &amp; the men are practicing it to much already for the good of the army. About the letters you are to dictate &amp; I to copy, send it &amp; whenever you like. I am willing to do anything to get you home.”

[Page 4]

“though I do feel a little delicacy in going to Gen. Pillow about my private affairs. I suppose you will not thank me for my letter if you again neglect to give you particulars of home. John has moved to the country. &amp; is beginning to realize how hard the farmers have to work. LC. &amp; Berry have been hauling in his corn this week. I expect he will begin to think that being a man of family is not as easy a life as single blessedness. For it is work all day &amp; nurse the baby at night. We killed our hogs &amp; beef on Monday last. &amp; received the pork from Mrs. Foulkes two weeks ago. The weather has been so warm that I am in constant dread of losing it. We have bought no more corn since you left. I think if you could get a good price for Brownlow you had better sell him. We have to keep him in the stable all the time. He has got so foolish father is afraid either to drive or ride him, &amp; I shall not have any use for him in some time. &amp; until you return he is likely to be of very little service. &amp; you had better get mad again, you see it does”</dc:relation>
<dc:description>Four-page letter from Mary Guthrie Latta to her husband, Samuel, conveys her anxiety at not hearing from him and her disappointment both in his defeat for promotion to Lt. Colonel and in his inability to come home for Christmas. She also relates news of the family and household affairs. It seems Samuel plans to coach Mary to write a letter of appeal to Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow that might get Samuel sent home--possibly through a plea of hardship.</dc:description>

“Dyersburg Tenn Jan 25 ‘62
My dear husband.
	I have looked in vain for a letter since you left home. &amp; have thought so much about you that last night I dreamed I had received one &amp; as I can’t have a real letter to answer I will answer the one I dreamed of. I am glad it was only a dream though – for it contained this piece of bad news – “My term of enlistment will be out the first of June, &amp; you need not look for me home until that time. As it will be impossible to obtain a furlough under any pretence.” Now as your coming home is the only pleasure I look forward to. Such news if true, would throw a considerable”

[Page 2]

“damper over my feelings. But why have you not written? Did you get disgusted with me when you were at home &amp; concluded I wasn’t worth writing to? If you did I am very sorry, but will have to acknowledge it as a good excuse for not writing. But if the Lincolnites get you, please let us know. There have no events transpired at home or in town since you left that will be likely to interest you. I have not been outside the yard but once since the evening we went to John’s. Our lives glide on from day to day in the same even channel. Everything is so peaceful &amp; quiet. That were it not for the absence of so many familiar faces it would be hard to realize that war, &amp; all its attendant horrors, are”

[Page 3]

“pressing so heavily throughout the whole country.
	Mrs. Webb &amp; Mrs. Jakes called &amp; interrupted me this evening while writing, &amp; as they usually make very long visits, this was not an exception. &amp; I have missed my chance of sending my letter by tomorrow’s mail. But in the meantime I rec’d yours by Mr. Ledsinger, for which I am very much obliged, as I know my sleep will be much sounder  &amp; my dreams not disturbed in trying to decipher half erased pencil marks. I am sorry I caused you any uneasiness in my note about Kate. As it was altogether slight &amp; will not have a scar. But at the time I wrote I did not know the extent of her injury. &amp; in my alarm magnified a thousand fold.”

[Page 4]

“But you need not expect anything else that that her face will be terribly disfigured, for besides all the burns &amp; bruises she gets, she has got to bumping her head through the window panes. &amp; of course at such tricks the little imp will get her face cut all to pieces. She asked me this evening if I was writing to Pa. I told her I was, “told tell Pa I tiss him.” Was her message. Johnny’s is “tell him when I get up I am going to say my lesson.” He has dropped off to sleep after talking me out of patience. For I can’t very well talk &amp; write at the same time. I don’t think I ever saw a child so devotedly fond of a father as he is of you. He seems to think his Pa is all &amp; everything that any body ought to be, &amp; I can govern him almost entirely by telling him of what you would like him to do.”</dc:relation>
<dc:description>Four-page letter from Mary Guthrie Latta to husband Samuel expresses anxiety over not receiving a letter from him and the fact that this worry has infiltrated her dreams. She writes of receiving visitors, of the children's exploits, and of managing the children on her own.  She notes how the peacefulness of her passing days contrasts with the horrors of the war.</dc:description>

<dc:relation>[Page 1]

“Dyersburg Tenn April 6th ‘62
My dear husband.
	I received your last letter yesterday - &amp; having dressed Johnnie for church, nursed the baby to sleep sent Kate to the kitchen to keep her from crying to be dressed to go to preaching &amp; now while I have a few moments of silence I will sit down to write you, that all’s well. Two little words, but containing a world of welcome news to an absent parent. I wish you could see Johnnie this morning – he is looking so very nice. I made him a pair of new pants - &amp; with his hands stuck in his pockets, he struts about as if he were lord of all he surveys. Kate wanted to go to preaching. I told her when she got as large as Johnny she might go. She told him to turn around &amp; let her measure to see if she wasn’t already as big - of course Johnny’s dignity was very much insulted at the idea”

[Page 2]

“You see I have to write you of the doings &amp; sayings of the children to make out a letter, for I haven’t one bit of news – but let me not forget the baby. My child – the dearest, sweetest &amp; best of all – your children aint nowhere. She has grown very fast, &amp; is as fat as a little dumpling – laughing &amp; crowing as merry as a bird (if birds laugh) &amp; already knows its mammy. Don’t you wish you could see it?
	We went last Wednesday &amp; spent the day with John. He is busy as can be on his farm. He begins to look a good deal like a farmer, but I fear it will prove too laborious a business for him. When he comes in from work he looks completely exhausted. &amp; I don’t think he will be able to stand the warm weather at all. Mother has been out there several days making soap. She may be glad she has no more sons to marry – for she has had her own troubles with her daughters, &amp; has been indeed a true mother to us. She passed her sixty ninth birth day a few days ago, &amp; is now in her seventyth year. &amp; yet as stirring &amp; energetic as any of her daughters. May her”

[Page 3]

“remaining days be passed peacefully &amp; happily in our home. I received a letter from Cousin Beck the day before I got yours telling me she could not come at present. I wrote to her that she might probably get here on the Ben McCullough, but since then, I hear it has been pressed into the service. &amp; I believe is not to go farther than the Point. I would like very much to see her, still am not very sorry that her visit is to be postponed for awhile until we get something to eat. As I see my vegetables peeping out of the ground I think it will not be a great while before I have something nice. We had news that you were expecting a battle there on yesterday – Saturday – I have been very uneasy, for fear it might be so – but have tried to comfort myself by thinking all is not truth that we hear. But whenever the hour does come, all I can do is to trust in Him who alone is able to save, &amp; my hope is, that He may be your shield on the day of battle. You think you will not get home any more until your time is out – it is a good while to do without seeing you. But if you only”

[Page 4]

“get home safely then I will try &amp; be satisfied. I was in hopes there would be no necessity for your returning, &amp; I cannot say a word either for or against it – my own selfishness would urge you to stay &amp; home. The country needs every man. &amp; I fear every woman too to help it out of the struggle in which it is engaged. But if you have to reenlist can’t you avoid doing so until your time is out. Then you can stay at home as long as you please.
	The weather is getting so warm I expect you will be needing some lighter underclothes. If Capt. Fowlkes can take them, I will send them to you. If not by the first opportunity.
	Make a general proclamation to the soldiers, that if they value their lives they had better let you come home. For if they don’t Johnny says he is coming down there &amp; kill them every one. Father desires me to give you his love &amp; say he is living in hopes of seeing you again soon. The children all send a kiss. As I can’t have you I kiss your likeness instead, which I have had before me since I have been writing. Thinking when I see it what a precious man you are for them old Yankees to shoot at. Goodbye.
					Ever yours,

“Macon June 7th
Dear Cousin Sam,
	I received a letter yesterday from Dr. Nheu of the New Con Grays informing me that you were Captain of a company in their regiment. I had a letter from Cousin Mary not long since, but – she said nothing about your leaving home. So that you may be sure I was surprised. You have the knowledge that you are doing right to cheer you, but it is terrible that you were obliged to leave home. I cannot tell you cousin mine how distressed I have been ever since I received the news. I have been thinking of Cousin Mary and the children so much”

[Page 2]

“I know she is a brave true woman but it must have been a heavy trial to give you up. When will these sad days be over? I try to hope for the best but it is hard to see any “light behind the cloud.” I had a letter from Mother last week Lucy has lost the Office. I think the man if man he can be called that was mean enough to take it from her must have buried everything in the way of generous and noble emotions. This letter will be given you by Dr. Nheu. I trust you will form his acquaintance. A better nobler man I never knew. He has been very kind to me, indeed he is one of the best friends I had in Macon. He is also an excellent”

“physician,  but I hope and pray that you may never need his nor any one’s service in that line, while you are gone. I have another very good friend in the Macon Grays. Mr. Dougan, 1st Lieutenant I think you have heard me speak of him, both the gentleman mentioned have been very kind to me ever since I have been in Macon. Cousin Sam if you should get sick or wounded and want a nurse you have but to let me know, and I will go to you at once. You have always served just as near and dear to me as a brother. Never shall I forget your kindness to me when I came a stranger to a strange land. Which is now our home by adoption. I think I should”

[Page 4]

“go to Dyersburg soon after school closes. I shall write to Cousin Mary to morrow. If you have time let me hear from you if not I will hear through Cousin M. It is school time and I must close. Hoping and praying that you may be preserved from all danger, and soon be restored to your home. I am as ever your affectionate cousin.

“Macon Dec. 29th 1861
Dear Cousin Sam,
	Your kind letter was received some days since, but I have been so busy preparing for our grand entertainment that I have not had time to write. It is over now, &amp; I am truly thankful. Our net proceeds were seventy dollars. Which I have paid to the agent of the Southern Mothers in Memphis. Every one seemed highly pleased with the performances, which consisted of music, tableaux, dialogues, &amp;c. Well, I cannot say that I have “fought, bled and died for my country.” Still I think have endured nearly as much in assisting get up the affair. Live and learn is a wise maxim, but I never so fully realized its truth”

[Page 2]

“as since we commenced preparing for the concert. Christmas thus far has been very dull here. I suppose it is the same every place. The old year is almost gone and what a year of suffering it has been. How many tears of sorrow and anguish and prayers of agony it has witnessed. We can only hope and pray that the coming one may have better times in store for us. True everything looks dosy and gloomy in the future. While there is so much macowber in my composition that I cannot but think “Something will turn up.” Though for some days past, I have felt, that I was almost “floored” Our school is small. Mr. Jones has not been able to make any collections, consequently cannot pay his teachers. I have almost determined to resign at the close”

[Page 3]

“of the present session. If I do, I will go to Dyersburg. I have not heard from Cousin Mary in some time. I do trust you went home Christmas. I received the paper containing your letter. What a brave, suble fellow Mr. Sampson must be. I think he took more prisoners than any one I have heard of. Give him my best respects and congratulations on his success. I am sure my most earnest desire, is that you may never have another battle. It made me heart sick to read the accounts of “The Belmont Skirmish,” (as the Federals term it.) How many sad hearts it has made. Poor Mrs. Bheu is so distressed. It seems as though she cannot be consoled. You have doubtless heard of the death of Mr. Neal. Our community has sustained a great loss, in losing him. He was one of the most”

[Page 4]

“useful and enterprising men here. I feel that I have lost my best friend in Macon. No father could have been kinder than he was. Thus one friend after another departs. But how comforting and consoling the thought that there is one friend who will never leave us. If we only trust in him. I have an opportunity of sending this letter today by one of the Macon Grays, who has been home on the sick list for some time. I am going to write cousin Mary in a few days though I am not in her debt. I should be truly glad to hear from you every time, you have leisure to write. I know you are kept very busy and have little time for writing. Wishing you a “Happy New Year” and hoping that you may be preserved from all the ills and dangers of war. I am truly your friend &amp; cousin.

She relates that she may have to leave her teaching position at a small school in Macon because collections cannot be made to pay the teachers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Correspondence from Jane Smith Washington to William L. Washington, December 18, 1864</dc:title>
<dc:relation>[Page 1]

“Do not think of coming home, unless I write for you, you could do us no good here, your presence would only add to our cares. All our friends are as kind as they can be and I hope in a few weeks to be able to tell you that everything is satisfactorily arranged. Till then be hopeful and cheerful, and study as hard as you can. Your letters of 5th, and 10th, have been received Good bye God bless you my dear boy.

My dear Son.
	I suppose you have received Mr. Andersons letter containing an account of the occurrences at home last Wednesday and Thursday week. Friday morning (9th) was bitter cold and in coming up very early in the buggy with Dr. Dunn, my fingers were frost bitten and I was not able to hold a pen or even dress myself for nearly a week, and so asked Mr. A to write to you, which he very kindly did. I will try to give you a faithful history of a scene which God willing I hope never to witness again. But first in order to give you a clear insight into the causes which prompted the act I must review some occurrences which took place in our immediate”

[Page 2]

“neighborhood only two days previously. On Monday the 5th four men dressed partly in federal uniforms had robbed in open day Traughber, Red Burns, Squire Ayres, Ledbetter, Jim Morrow and several others. Dr. Dunn called by that afternoon and told us of it. The next day those same men robbed old Stroud Buck Darden and took Lon Polks horse. That night about 9 o’clock Dr. Dunn again stopped at the gate and told us to look out that those men were in the neighborhood and would pay us a visit. The next morning old Dick reported that they had been seen in the Vanhook field. All these things naturally put us on the qui vive, and we were looking every moment for the robbers. We and not a neighbor in five miles had ever heard that there was a horse presser in the country. We were all expecting robbers, but had no idea there was a federal in the country. Your Father had been at the Tobacco”

[Page 3]

“barn all day and about half past three, he came to the house with Joe and eat his dinner. He had just risen from the table when Joe and Irene came rushing in saying two robbers were at the stable trying to steal Ball. Your Father seized his gun and rushed out, saw one of the men leading Ball off from the stable door and fired upon him instantly. So rapidly did the thing transpire that before I could run to the wall, the shot was fired and the mans companion was galloping with all his might down towards the mill. Your Father and Granville mounted to go in pursuit of the fellow, who had jumped the Orchard fence and was making rapidly for the Chestnut lot Granville went through the Peach Orchard your Pa started rounding by the pond, and at the grannary came in sight of a squad who fired on him several times. He”

[Page 4]

“at once returned to the house, had Granville called in and prepared for defence expecting every moment to be attacked by the gang of robbers as we thought them to be. In the mean time the gang rode off in the direction of the Cedar Hill were gone nearly and hour, when they returned, rode to the stable where I had had the man locked up, and then turned and again went towards Cedar Hill. I had the stable door locked when the man staggered into it, because I thought he was only wounded and perhaps some one might be able to identify him and thus discover who composed the gang. He had on federal pants his other cloths were those of a citizen. While the men were still round the place, I wrote to Dr. Dunn to get some friends and come to our assistance and sent to Col. Downey for a guard. In less than an hour after Foster returned from Turnersville, Dr. Dunn came over with a Co from the 7th Ohio,”

[Page 5]

“Col Garrard, the whole command 160 men encamped there that night and saw the man, and heard the circumstances, and the Col remarked that your Pa was doing good border service, that he saw no evidence of the fellow having belonged to either army, and applauded you Father for his act. Col. Downey sent down a squad but finding us amply guarded by Col. Garrards forces they returned to Springfield. The next morning not fifteen minutes after Col. G. left the house, about twenty men of the 8 Michigan under Lieut. Crowley came dashing up to the house like demons and in an instant were swarming all over it calling for your Father with the most blasphemous oaths and abusive epithets, threatening to shoot him on sight. I took Lieut. Crowley to the room where your Father was, he abused him for every thing under the sun, but your Father never answered him a word except that he was not conscious of having done wrong, but that before a”

[Page 6]

“proper tribunal he would answer any questions. His calmness only enraged them more, I saw they would murder him if they took him from the house, and I and your Grandmother in tears and on our knees besought that man to send him under guard to Springfield, he scoffed at our prayers and drove us from him with oaths. They finally took your Father and started off with him but had not got to the top of Jinneys hill before they were overtaken by a squad of the 14th Illinois under Lieut. Evans and your Father was brought back again. Crowleys command returned also, and then began a scene which I shudder to recall. I stood by your Father all the time, feeling that his safety even for a moment depended upon me. The officers incited the men to greater fury than even then possessed them and after talking to them in a way to rouse their bad passions even higher left them without control to vent their fury at will. For two mortal hours,”

[Page 7]

“threats, curses, jeers and taunts as to his fate were heaped upon him and I, pistols were snapped in his face, and shaken over his head, my prayers and tears were made a scoff and jest, a band of indians could not have taken more devilish delight in tormenting a prisoner. Your Father stood confronting them calmly and fearlessly, steadily looking into their eyes, and they quailed before the steady gaze of an unarmed prisoner like cowards as they were. I felt the end was drawing near and taking my arms from around him, I started to seek an officer leaving the three little girls standing round his feet. I had not left him a second when I heard a shot and turning saw your Father staggering from the shock, but in one instant he had recovered himself and was grappling the pistol with both hands. I rushed in between them and clasping my darling round the neck placed my body between him and”

[Page 8]

“the man, who cocking his pistol would have shot again through me, had not a comrade caught his hand with the remark “you have done enough” I shrieked murder with all my power. Your Father stood as calmly defiant as ever. The children screaming round our knees, and those demons gloating over our misery. In twenty minutes or longer Lieut. Doyle of 8th Michigan came to us, and through his influence we were allowed to go to the house, where he helped me bind up the wound until the arrival of Dr. Dunn. One of the men who had most strongly threatened your Fathers life, came with us to the house, our self appointed guard and remained in the room with his gun all the time. While this had been transpiring the house had been pillaged from ground to cellar trunks broken open &amp; rifled, furniture chopped to pieces with axes, doors burst down , and your Grandma cursed and told if she did not give them 500.”

[Page 9]

“dollars they would burn the house over her d_nd old head. They robbed Granville of everything he had.
Now let me tell you how wonderfully God worked for our salvation, while these scenes were being enacted here, a man who had gone to Springfield to get a reciept for his horse, overheard the threats of those men and going to Col. Downey told him, to go down and save us if he could. Boyd heard the same rumors, Col. Wiley Woodard also heard them &amp; reported them to the Col. who at their suggestion and from the noble instincts of his own heart jumped into the saddle and with Boyd and an escort of 12 men, came under whip and spur through the near way to our rescue. Not one moment too early did he come, their plundering almost done, the next act would have been murder and fire as was proved by their firing the straw in the cellar, just after Col. Downey came.”

[Page 10]

“He saw the Lieut. And I do not know how he accomplished it but by asserting his authority as commandant of this post to hold prisoners charged with any crime he got your Father out of their hands and into his. Then I felt his life was measurably safe, but Col. Downey had but 12 men while they were 50 strong, and we feared that after night they might over power his guard and still work their will. To guard against any difficulty the Col. sent back to Springfield for reinforcements and after their arrival, left us a guard of fifteen men, and with the others brought your Father here. While Col. Downey was waiting for his reinforcements, the men of Crowleys &amp; Evans commands, began to burn the outbuildings Col. D. had only men enough to guard the house and we had to let them burn. The Woods, barn with the whole Tobacco crop was first consumed, then the shuck pens and corn cribs, then the large”

[Page 11]

“barn where the hay was kept. (you remember the barn and stable below the house) That set some of the negro cabins on fire but they were extinguished, then they burned the Rocky barn in which was stored, wagons farming implements, threshing machine shingles enough to cover the house, and  many other valuable things. The fencing caught from this fire, and but for the prompt exertions of Seargent Jackson (a negro) the whole place would have been consumed.
	I can never forget Col. Downey and noble Col. himself, to the privates in the ranks, deserve our warmest gratitude, you are indebted to them, through God’s good providence for your Fathers life. My children shall remember Col. Downey as their greatest benefactor.
	The case has been laid before Gen. Rassean, and Gen. Thomas, and they approve Col. D’s conduct throughout. We are staying with Gen. Garner, and he, his most excellent Wife and all”

[Page 12]

“his family vie with each other in kindness. Your Father is held subject to farther orders none of our friends anticipate any trouble. Most probably when the excitement subsides about Nashville his case will recieve attention. The bullet passed entirely through his arm above the elbow, but missed the bone, it is healing as well as we could desire. Boyd remained with your Grandma until day before yesterday, he will return there again. When our future movements have been determined on I will write you fully. For the next few weeks we remain in Springfield either here or at Aunt Susans. Grandma and the children are well. I hear from them every day. I wonder she did not die under this great distress but God has upheld her as He has done us all. Blessed be His name for ever more. My heart says Amen, in the fulness of gratitude to Him and the instruments he used to show His power.

“Greenvil Sept 18th 1862
Dear Pa

And I think there will several Companies be made up in this County in the next two weeks and what say you to me take the place of first Lieutennant in one of them for I have had a proposition made me and I have a notion of taken it if you are willing and Ma says yes. If I go at all it will be with a verry clever man by the name of Eason but I am a little affraid of the men that will volentier at this late date But there is some good Sothren men left yet and Eason knows all the men in this County as he has been a Merchant for several years in Greenvill
	Well I received your letter last night and found enclosed in it two ten dollar bills that I may kneed before long as I may have to go to Knoxvill about Monday and if so I will have to buy me a coat to wear and if I go to Knoxvill I intend coming home to stay a day or two if I can spare the time. But if I do not go to Knoxvill I can wate until next week for my coat. If want you to have it made in uniform stile with brass buttons strait Cotton &amp;c I can get me a coat made out of grey Janes here that will cost me about twenty five dollars and the Janes is fine and thick. And I was thinking of buying the cloth and sending it home but it will cost about three dollars a yard”

[Page 2]

“and another thing that I was wanting a coat fir is, I have been invited to a weding, by a young man who is aging to marry one of the Miss  Netherlands in Sulavan County and I would like to go and see some of my Couisns That I have never seen it comes of next Thursday and I may get my coat in that time. A coat here will cost twenty five dollars ready made at this place but I will have to buy it from the Jew as there is nobody has them here except Jews	I will buy me a pair of boots as the price is getting higher every week and I can get me a good pair for thirteen dollars  There is an Irish Bootmaker here that has taken a great fancy to me and he wants to make me a pair of boots  He went to Knoxville last week to get me some leather and he will not charge me any thing for making them except the price of the leather and he makes a very good boot.
	Cousin Robert Willson spent one night this week with me he is on his way to Sulavan to buy some flour and he thinks he can get it for ten dollars a barrel and I told him to buy me five at that price he said he would.
	I am nearly well again and havent any idea how long I will stay here if Martial Law is extended in Tennessee I will stay a good while. But if Rob resigns his place we will join Morgan as Capt Brittain has promised him he will give me a transfer to some other Company  Tell Willie &amp; Laura that I read their letters and I was glad to see that they were learning to write  Tell Laura to learn fast and for her and Willie to write to me again  I will not kneed any money unless I have to buy a coat   Your affectionate Son

“Bells Bridge July 29th /63
Dear Pa
	Your letter came to hand a few days since without date I was glad to hear from home and to hear that Rob had been there also to hear that Col Fain had taken Command of his regt again I think Rob will get along better but I was sorry to hear that Capt Brittain had resigned for I think Rob would get allong better with Fulkerson as first Lt than as Captain I read a letter from Rob the same day with yours He says that you are talking of moving into Georgia and he thinks it would suit you very well and I am of the same opinion for I think it is most too confining for you to stay in the store, any how while the weather is so warm and I think you can get along without working so hard and I think you &amp; Ma have done enough to rest a while. And I think “

“could get a house to live in in Georgia it would suit you better than to live in Cleveland though I do not know how you &amp; Ma would get along without some Daily paper to read you could buy you a pony and let Willy ride to the depot for your mail
	I would like verry much to be at home &amp; see some of the men from Vicksburg &amp; hear their account of the fight. I see that Vaughns Brigade is to stay in this department and I suppose they will see an easier time than at Vicksburg except the marching part off it. We are still resting at this place and I havent any idea how long we will remain here One of the regts belonging to Frazers Brigade has just come in it has been stationed at Knoxville ever since we went to Chattanooga the Brigade is at this time all together except one of our Companies at Strawberry Plaines though I understand”

[Page 3]

“that it will be here in day or two I have been trying to get to go to the Plaines so that I could get to see Rob I have failed so far, but I may succeed yet. Col Allen came to see me yesterday and returned to Knoxville to day. I never saw a set of men as well pleased as the men of this regt was when they saw him riding up His time of suspension will be out the 31st of this month and he says he will take command of the regt Then the rest of the officers have not been restored yet, and I think they will not be soon I have a notion of changing my position in the regt from Ord Sergt. to Waggon Master. The place of Ordnance Sergt does not pay me enough for the responsibility I have &amp; the other place will pay me the same and will have no responsibility besides I am furnished with a horse to ride”

“and can have a great deal more privilages Can go &amp; come when I please. I did not write to you any thing about my arm in my other letters. I tried the medicine which Dr. Ford gave me and I think that it healed the sore up too sudently and caused it to break out [under?] my arm. And it makes a verry sore place &amp; keeps me from doing any duty I am in hopes it will be well before we have to make another march I tried to get a furlough home until my arm got well but could not get it unless I would go to the hospittal at Knoxville &amp; I would not do that I could get to go to the country and stay a week or two if I chose but I believe I will not do it unless I get worse that I am now.

Dear Sir
	No doubt you have long ere this heard the melancholey tidings that you were deprived of an affectionate and worthey son &amp; your Family of a fond and loving brother, in the severe engagement of the 16th May when Southern chivalry charged the Enemy from a strong &amp; splendidly entrenched position at the Bluff (Drurys)
	I write not to give a history of battles but simply to inform you of the last moments of your son Capt. Rob. Rutledge as I had it from our minister who was with him in his last moments. I saw and conversed with Rob the evening before the fight He was quite cherful”

[Page 2]

“and said he was glad he had come to Va. As it was for the good of his Country The morning of the 16th we started on a charge about 5 o’clock and charged up a full plain road within 400 yards of the Enemy when they opened on us with Grape &amp; musketry Then Rob was struck by a Minnie Ball the Ball entering his left lung He was imediatily taken to the rear, where he was waited on by Ladies from Norfolk Va. to whom he conversed freely of his condition and future prospects. He at the same time being perfectly aware that he would soon die. He Lingered until 6 o’clock in the evening when he died so calmly &amp; as happily as if he was at Home. No doubt seemed to enter his mind as to his acceptance with his saviour”

[Page 3]

“He asked our Minister to pray with him said he had been a member of the Presbyterian church for some time &amp; that He was perfectly resigned to the will of God. His was a happy death and we cannot mourn for him, for our loss has been to his eternal gain A fiew Hours before he died a letter was handed him from his Wife which was read to him by Liut Yost of our Company when it was finished he said Thank God I have heard once more from Home His last words were of his family and Friends He expressed a wish that all should meet him in Heaven All concur in saying never did man die more resigned or Happily such my dear sir was the death of your Son We cannot regret”

Camp near Cumberland Gap April 1st 
Dear Wife
	I wrote Pa yesterday by Sagt John England asking my valicece sent me. I now write asking it not sent as yesterday evening I bought a trunk . One made exactly like the one Ophilia is using in your room I gave four dollars for it, it is somewhat worn but has a good lock and hinges and will answer me better than my valiece. We have moved from our old camps about one and 3/4ths miles Are in quarters lately ocupied by Hilliards Legien have a tolerably comfortable cabin, has a floor but is quite airy. Brit is sweeping it up and I can hardly write but hope you can read it We moved yesterday, was snowing occasienally all day. A small skift of snow on the ground now. Our situation I do not like because we are in a splendid place to be surprised A high hill on each side of us, I bought a trunk at four dollars a cot, a very nice one at two dollars and a quilt at two dollars. We will stay here all summer and I am going to try to live comfortable. last night was a swinger and I like to froze out , will buy another quilt and then I can have a good warm comfortable bed. Dr Atchly has resigned his place as asst Surgeon and starts home tomorrow. Sorry he has gone. He was a special friend of mine. The Tories have stoled all his corn since he left home. Some four or five hundred bushils, enough to make any man”

[Page 2]

“want to get home ant it? Do not know who will fill his place, have found out that Col Fulkerson did not oppose my being Asst Surgeon but I never knew that it was just one or two Lieuts. in the Regt that opposed it because I had knocked some of their friends out of that situation; They unknowingly unintentionally done me a great favor. The Lincolnites, Bushwackers of Harlan County have sent in a petition to Col Fain asking for a cessasion of hostilities it is signed by the Capt of the Bushwackers, and in their petition they invite all the Southern men that they have run away from Harlin to return to their homes, guarentieing them protection of lives and property. Col F. done thus much in subduing the enemy in his last trip to Harlin. Should this letter reach you before Sarg England sees you my other letter will tell you what we done on that trip (or at least they,) I am about sound again and hope I may stay well during my stay at this old Gap. We will move up into the Gap in a few days in our tents. And I think will stay there untill peace is made, if it ever is. A great many parolid North Western Deserters have passed through this Gap on their way to their homes. Say they will fight us no more. This is the 1st of Apr Tom Hoyl came down to our cabin and call me in a great hurry to see a sick man as both our Surgeons are on the other side of the Gap I went and found him sleeping soundly and sweetly, fooled warnt I? I paid Tom back with interest in about half an hour. About a dozen have come in today to see Capt Brittain dying with the cholic and found him up and well, and were told that their trouble was all for the 1st of Apr. such is our life and our fun, but our hardships ______

	May need a hat with my fine suit if I get it
Cumberland Gap Apr 5th 1863
Dear Wife
	I recd yours of March 31st 1863 on yesterday was truly glad to learn you were all well and it was with great pleasure I prerused your letter. My letters come so irregular that I hardly know when to look for letters from you. Last night was a very cold one and I froze out about an hour before day it is a cold bleak place out here, and does not suit me as far as climate and water is concerned but the way things now stand in the Army I believe I would prefer staying here to any where else until fall except it were on the Rail Road. You say that Pa talks somthing like coming to see me this Summer. I would love very much to see him but he cannot come without a great deal of trouble and probably would make himself sick he could not enjoy himself here because it is up hill both ways as it is downhill both ways in Ala. I want to see Pa but do not want him to undertake a trip to this place. Since the Alabamains, Gen Grays pets and the old rip himself have left we have been getting more to eat, also get a better quality have for the past week had splendid Flour &amp; Bacon and get Sugar at five cents pr pound and dried fruit at three cents pr pound, but fruit is not good, wish I could secure some Sugar to send home but there is no chance I have not been on duty for two weeks. Our left wing is under command of Maj Akin. That will account sufficently for my long release from duty. You say that I have a $500 bond and three $100”

[Page 2]

“interest bearing notes suppose that will include the $100 I sent by Mr. Edmundson. I want to try to have $1000 at interest or due me against the 16th day of May, at which time I will have served as a Lieut one year, and I want a little surplus to start on for my next year . If I were in Texas that much would buy me a right snug little home You and Pa seem to think that I am most wretchidy despondant because I cannot get home. I am tired of this war and tired of being seperated from the loved ones at home, but if God gives me health and I am not captured by the foe I will be at the side of the last man that will stand and contend at the point of the bayonett for our  homes and all that is near and dear to one in this life. I would be very happy to kiss the little baby Boy of mine that says his ugly Pappy has gone to Cum. Gap to shoot Yank. Also would be happy to see little Eva, hope she may have good health and be a good child to raise. In fact would be happy to see each any and all of you. We have drilled none since we came over here. Think Maj Akin will not drill us here if atall. Went out today and got a mess of wild greenes for dinner. They were superb to the palate of a soldier. I feel very well today but as for my health in general I fear it is on the decline. I would not weigh near so much as when I left home. Dr Atchly my special friend has left us. he applied for a furlough and it would not be granted and he resigned and went home. Write soon
Yours as ever RARutledge”</dc:relation>

“Cumberland Gap Apr 30th 1863
Dear Wife
	I recd a letter from Pa a few days ago and answered it I was happy indeed last night to receive a good long letter from you, but indeed sorry to hear my little Boy was still sick. I would love to be where I could attend to him and nurse him. And so for little Eva I can hardly think of her than just a little babe, not able to do any thing. You say she was trying to catch your paper and laughing while you were writing. Would love to nurse her and see her laugh. I would have been happy to have seen Green and your Father. I know it was a great gratification to you to be with them once more for a while. – Glad the Clarks and Jim Porter and Jess Kidd are into it. Suppose we will have more help. – Not much did you say? – You are mistaken about one of our Company dying in Cleveland. That Johnson was a R.R. hand and a Brother to Jim Johnson of our Company – I am highly pleased with the description of the farm that Gellespie has purchased for Pa. Think Pa ought to write Gillispe word to purchase the adjoining tract that he spoke of. I wish I were ready to get to Texas now. I will before long have a thousand dollars – if I should live to do so I expect to buy land in Texas with it. I now have just five dollars left, Lt Lane had a chance to send the $30.00 to me that I sent by him to buy me that cloth but did not do it. I can borrow some money to do me untill I draw. The Government is due me today $1.80 You seem to regret that you had to buy a calico dress for you and George on account of prices. Whenever you need any “

[Page 2]

“thing just buy it. Do not render yourself or the children uncomfortable on account of high prices. You and Pa seem to think there is not much danger of an invasion of East Ten. There is not much probability of an attact here until after the Tullahoma fight. Our Cavalry brought five prisoners in that were captured at Barbourville. Three were from Ohio and two East Tennesseans, one from Ohio was a Lieut. They say we will have work to do here shortly. They were very talkative and were wedded to their cause I asked the Yank Lieut if he saw any indication of peace he said that there was less prospect of peace now than ever before, he said he wished for peace and the whole Northern army were the same way. I believe from all the signs of the times that this war has just commenced I believe that more blood will be spilled, yet than has been spilled during this war. I write Pa about the probability of my being arrested for trying to get out of Grays Brigade. I am still at large but am at their service. McBrittain says for Pa to tell Lush Osmant to send him about $100 in his shinplasters and he will pass them off for him. We hear that the Linclonites are cutting up in Bradley. Stealing and pressing guns. The boys are writing to different portions of the county to get them to petition the authorities to let our Company come to Cleveland and rid the county of all such Tories. I want Pa to see if he can do any thing to get us there. Write soon with love to all. I am as ever yours &amp;c

He asks his wife to buy needed provisions without concern for price.

“Cumberland Gap Apr 19th /63
Dear Father
	Considering the signs of the times I thought that I would drop you a few lines concrning the times as to the part East Tennessee is to play in this great struggle. I want you and the family to keep out of the reach of the Yankees if human power can do it. It would grieve me almost as bad to hear that you had off passed from the land of the living as to hear you were in the hands of the Yankees. They would most certainly imprison you and as to what might befall the female portion of the family and the little children I can hardly bear my mind to dwell upon it a minute. Dispatches to this point and these that are deemed reliable show that the enemy are going to make a seperate struggle to take and hold East Tennessee. Burnside is at Lexington with a heavy force. This will be his base of operations for a while. it is my belief that they intend to invest East Tennessee and if they try they can take it. Only a small force is required to come in the rear of C Gap to make us all skedaddle or surrender It is a fact to plainly to be seen by the enemy that East Tennessee is but poorly provided with troops They have a chance to be as well advised upon the number and desposition of our troops as we ourselves. Should Burnside really make a move upon us at this place he will take the Gap. not by whipping us but by coming in our rear and cutting off supplies. five or six days would do the work Cleveland is a place the enemy will make a strike for as soon as possible, so as to gain both”

“R. R. I think your position is very safe at Cleveland and I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             want you to be prepared to leave for some point that is safer than Cleveland. Pa do not put off running untill it is too late I want you to run if you have to leave all our household goods. by going you can save all your money and every thing beside being insulted abused and starved to death. Keep posted and have every thing ready. If you cant get away any other way get a waggon or two and cut across into Georgia and get away from any R.R. I am not scared but the signs of the times all indicate that East Ten is to be made a battle ground if the enemy push on it is theirs for a time. We cannot help it. Troops are engaged at other points and I do not see where reinforcements are to come from. I am astonished that the Yanks have not made a raid into Cleveland before this it would be a very easy matter to accomplish it. There is new great probability of our being attacted here. It would not surprise me at any time to hear the enemys guns. We are now encamped on the North side of the Gap. Are in our camps, about 100 yards from the Breastworks and not far from the most important artilery, if the fight comes we will have the fun of supporting the batteries at the point where the enemy will try to take the Gap. Our Boys will fight well, and we will never surrender while human courage and endurance can stand it. Not many expect a fight here but I am”

[Page 3]

“see by the action of the officers in command that a fight is expected here soon. We were reinforced today by three Battallions of Infantry and one Company of Artilery and one of Cavalry Gen Gracy is here for a short time. I am well pleased with our Camping ground. The enemy cannot well surprise us where we are. We are very scarce of rations here at present. Hutch has just arrived and brought a letter from Nerva. Glad to hear you were all well. The enemy two Regts Strong are reported at Harlin Court House and fifteen hundred mounted men are reported as having passed through Morison Gap. Suppose they wish to get the Saltworks or Burn Bridges.”

[Page 4]

“Be careful where your money is so that you can always have a safe place to hide it Pa my honest convictions are that this war has just commenced. If I live I expect to serve out my full term of three years and have to enlist again. I see less prospect of the war ending now then ever. I think if you would try you might get a safer and cheaper place to live than Cleveland. I started my Grey Janes Pants and my two woolen shirts home today They will be either sent to you by express or be left at Coz Billy Ingles. I did not know when we might have to retreat and I cannot carry all my clothes so I thought best to pull off my Shirt and send home one is clean and the other dirty, if they are left at Coz Billy get the first one passing to express them Write soon
I am well Your Son RARutledge.”</dc:relation>

“Cumberland Gap May 21st 1863
Dear Wife
	I received your and Pas letter yesterday evening was glad to hear from you. it was handed to me first about an hour by sunset. Just as I was breaking the seal to read it Maj Akin rode up and told us that about five hundred Yankee Cavalry were in site. I had seen them half and hour before but supposed they were some of our own Cavalry. I had to pocket the letter and get the Company ready for action. Col Hart with about two hundred  Cavalry went out and offered the white livered blue bellies battle but they run. We were giving to throw a few Bombs among them and Col Hart was going to charge them, but we were too late getting ready. They came in behind our Pickets and wounded one severely and captured some. do not know yet exactly how many. About seventeen were missing last night. Just about dark I had got my paper out to write you when Lt Col Fulkerson called for me and ordered me to take our Camp out on Picket and hold the enemy in check if they should come until the men at the breast”

[Page 2]

“works could get ready to receive the enemy I took the Company out and posted them so we would have a good view of the road and made all the men lay down in line with their guns by their sides. I would allow no fire to be built and as I had sold my overcoat I would suffer with cold during the night, but I took a good smoke threw away some of the largest rock where I was going to lay, found a flat rock turned the soft side up for to lay my head on. Wraped my blanket around me put my head on my homade pillow hugged my musket up by my side and soon was in the land of nod. When I awoke it was near daylight. I had slept finely and comfortably. No enemy came to desturb our rest, and if they had come I should not have considered it much of a disturbance because I felt inclined to pass a few shots with them I was just going to write to Gam but if he has left Clinton I suppose I had better wait untill I hear from him. We were reinforced here yesterday by Hilliards Legion and a company of Artilery are coming in today The Yanks have just commenced with us here and I expect we will receive frequent visits from them during the summer. The trees are”

[Page 3]

“getting green now so that they can slip on us and bushwack our Pickets if the do nothing more. Harry Henry had a difficulty with one of Kanes Artilery yesterday. Harry shot at him four times. The fellow alas shot at Harry. The last time Harry shot they were not more than five or six feet apart. Harry would have killed him instantly but the ball struck a button and glanced, entering at the lower part of the breast bone and it is thought lodged down in the muscles of the side. The wound is now not thought to be mortal. There was no necessity of the fight. Harry was not arrested. What is to be done with Henry I do not know. You may tell Reeders folks about the fight but let the news be wrote home by some one else besides myself. Jim Henry is with us. he seems to be a very clever man. And is very pleasant and agreeable much more so than either of the others. Capt Brittains brotherinlaw, a Mr Runions has the Small Pox and is a short distance of the Capts family. They were with him untill he broke out. Capt is very uneasy and cannot hear from home I want Pa to see Dave Kincannon and find out all he can about Runions and Capt’s family and write me as soon as you can. Capt is about well again”

[Page 4]

“Tell George that I will send him some Goobers if I can get them and will send him a new dress if I can get it. Tell him he must be a good Boy, and not forget his Pappy. And tell him he mus kiss his little Sister for me. You talked about sending me some Pepper  I do not need Pepper untill cold weather. Sorry to hear that Ophilia and Laura had been sick. What is Milly Lucy and Nigger Em doing? Pa sold Agent $200 too cheap he was worth $600 easy these times I wrote to Levi Hoyle regarding Lawsens discharge I signed it and returned it to Curry and supposed it had been given to Lawsen, untill I learned better. A few weeks ago. I am going to send you three rings. One for yourself one for George (the plain one) and a little one for Eva. I fear George and Evas are too small but they are as large as my peace[?] of Gutta Perka would make. I will make Ophilea and Laura one apece some time if I can get the material. I made your ring all to notching it Brown notched it for me. I made Georges, and Brown made Evas. I had just understood that the Cavalry Picket that was wounded was shot was shot after he had surrendered A citizen piloted them in &amp; shot the man and after he he had shot him he wanted to shoot him again. Col Hart has gone out today to try to capture the citizen Hart will hang him if he catches him and is going to burn all his property. hope he will catch him 
I am well and as stout as usual
Write soon and give me all the news
Very Truly yours &amp;c RARutledge”</dc:relation>

“Uncle Sams. Apr 8th 1864
Dear Father
	I redc a letter from Minerva yesterday telling me that all the family were well with the exception of yourself. And as my letters will be of more interest to you than any one else upon account of locality I have concluded to answer Minervas letter by writing to you I wrote to Minerva a few days ago from Aunt Elziras. in that for you I gave the encampment of the different Brigades. for fear that the letter may not reach you I will tell you in this how we are encamped. Gen Buckner has resumed Command of his Division and has his Hed Quarters upon the hill we used to call the old Orchard. it is on the hill that is directly opposite the front end of Aunt Elziras house All around him are scattered Provost Guards and waggon trains &amp;c. Johnsons Brigade is encamped in the woods between the Old Buher field and the road. You remember that square of eight or ten acres it is now pretty much cut down. Graceys Brigade is encamped back of the plantation next to where Sam Millard and Aunt Elziras mother used to live. Laws Brigade is encamped about opposite the old clover field on Uncle Sams and the Old Edwards farm A Battallion of Artiliry is encamped in the woods directly back of the old White top place. Waggon Trains and Quarter Master and Company quarters are scattered all about on Uncle Sams and Aunt Elziras, and the Buher farm. The fences are all torn down in every direction, and Aunt Elzira and Uncle Sam I fear will be prevented from making any crop this year. Aunt Elziras Negroes are doing no good. They steal from her about as fast as they make. They have even been stealing and selling hay I do not know what the Citizens here are to do if we remain much longer where we are. Aunt Elzira sold her best horse to a gap soldier for $800.00 on a short credit and has never herd anything from the man since. I consider his note as worth nothing Felix Earnist is going to Richmond on some business and I gave him the note to try the young mans”

[Page 2]

“Father and see if he will pay the det, but I understand that he has been disenhereted by his Father for bad conduct and I fear Mr Earnest will not get the money for Aunt Elzira Aunt Elzira is in a great deal of trouble and I do not know how she will make out for the next year.
Went down and saw Uncle George Anderson and Aunt Elza a few days ago. They are all well, and are still living with John Anderson. The Country that we have evacuated is swept of every thing families almost everywhere have been robbed by the soldiers. They are robbing the Citizens around here of every thing they have to eat. The Country we have passed over is said not to have a Hog goose duck turkey or chicken or sheep left. Starvation is now staring many a poor defenseless Southern woman and many many poor helpless little children in the face Our Army is getting to be as much dreaded as the low down thieving Yankees. Some of the Alabamiens went a few days ago to a mill near here and found some ground Plaster in an old bolting chist and thinking it was Shirts they stold several Haversacks full of it, and after they had got it baked they said they had never seen such bread as that before. (this is a matter of fact) Tim Millers Brother of Capt Sam is dead. The funeral procession has just passed here a few minutes ago. Said to have died from excitement and trouble. I went up to Bristol a few days ago and got the promise of a shoe pattern. From Alf Carmack. For $16.00, his common price is $24.00. I staid all night with him They send their respects to the family Uncle George Andersons Aunt Elziras and Uncle Sams families, are all well with the exception of Catherine who is only slightly sick. They all send respects to the family. Hope Gamble will soon be exchanged and get a furlough to come home and stay with you for a while. I have not felt right well for several days but am knocking about, and drilling. Think we will leave here before long. Think at best the principal portion of the Army will shortly go to Va probably all but Buckners Division. Lt Brittian has returned.
You and Minerva must write soon

<dc:description>J. S. Burrow writes his brother from Chester County detailing his financial problems, his inability to collect money until cotton comes to market, his desire to move from Jacks Creek for better money-making opportunities, and his fear that he will eventually have to enter military service.  He  contends General Pillow will re-take Ft. Henry if he can muster enough troops.  He notes that unconfirmed rumors state Pillow has whipped the enemy at Fort Donelson.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Confederate earthworks protecting the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers fell to Federal troops in February 1862.  The attack from Union ironclads brought down Fort Henry on February 6, 1862, prior to the arrival of Federal soldiers overland.  A longer battle involving both army and navy was required to bring down Fort Donelson on February 16, 1862.  Thus, the North had its first major victory and entre into the heart of the South.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Tennessee General Assembly formed the General Claims Commission February 19, 1868, to compensate loyal citizens who suffered property losses at the hands of Union or Confederate forces and to pay unpaid wages.  The Commission operated through county claims commissioners and were to present the claims to the U.S. Government; however, the claims were recorded but not paid.  Wartime claims would be both recorded and paid through the Southern Claims Commission, formed in 1871.</dc:description>

<dc:title>John Thomas Wright Affidavit</dc:title>
<dc:relation>	“John Thomas Wright being duly sworn testifies as follows: There were two companies of cavalry organized in Lebanon, that became members of the 4th Tenn. Cavalry, commanded by Col. Baxter Smith. Company F was commanded by Capt. J. R. Lester and Company K was commanded by Capt. Jim Britton. I belonged to Company F from its organization until it was paroled by Charlotte, N. C. on May 3, 1865. On the record I made, I am now on the pension roll of Tennessee.
	Mr. Huse Burke did not belong to either of said companies, nor to the 4th Tenn. Cavalry: However, he had a brother, James Burke who did belong to Company F, and made a gallant soldier, and was killed in a charge at the battle of Chickamauga on September 20, 1863. If Mr. Huse Burke was ever tried or threatened to be tried by a Federal Court martial, it was as a citizen and not as a member of the 4th Tennessee Cavalry.

Sworn to before me, this 24 day of February, 1923.
