<dc:title>&quot;The Airman's Escape&quot;</dc:title>
<dc:description>&quot;The Airman's Escape&quot; is George W. Puryear's autobiographical account of his capture and escape from a German POW camp during World War I. His account appeared in the April 1919 (p. 452-462) and May 1919 (p. 615-628) issues of Atlantic Monthly magazine.  The pages were removed from the magazine and bound together into a booklet. The story is also reprinted (verbatim) as Appendix B in Harold Buckley's book &quot;Squadron 95&quot; (New York: Arno Press, 1972).</dc:description>
<dc:description>After completing pilot training at Issoudun and gunnery school at Cazaux, Puryear served a few months as a ferry pilot before being joining the 95th Aero Squadron on July 16, 1918. He was taken prisoner on July 26 and, after spending time in several POW camps, arrived at Villingen, Germany on September 15. Mass escape attempt made from camp on October 6. On October 11, Puryear swam across Rhine River at Waldshut, Germany to reach Switzerland, becoming first American officer in World War I to successfully escape from a German POW camp.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Both sides suffered appalling casualties on the Western Front. During the Third Battle of Ypres (1917), about 140,000 British soldiers were killed to gain five miles (or one soldier for every 2.25 inches). During the Battle of Verdun (1916), the French Army suffered 377,000 casualties and the German Army 337,000. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme (1916), the British Army suffered 60,000 casualties (roughly the population of the city of Franklin, Tennessee, in 2010).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Due to a shortage of American fighter planes, American fighter squadrons in France were given the French-built Nieuport 28 fighters beginning in March 1918. Due to a shortage of machine guns, the planes were equipped with only one gun each. While maneuverable and easy to fly, the Nieuport 28s had unreliable engines and were notorious for shedding the fabric on their upper wings in a steep dive. By the summer of 1918, American squadrons had replaced their Nieuport 28s with the SPAD S.XIII.</dc:description>
