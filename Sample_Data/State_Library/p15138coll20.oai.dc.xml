<dc:description>Two photographs of American POWs at Burg Trausnitz and the envelope of a letter from Mabel Martin of Memphis, Tennessee, to George W. Puryear while he was a POW.</dc:description>
<dc:description>On August 19 or August 20, George W. Puryear was sent by train with eighteen British and six American POWs from Karlsruhe to Landshut, Germany. The trip took two days. The Americans were imprisoned in Burg Trausnitz (a castle dating to the 13th century). The British were imprisoned in a separate camp in town. On September 14, Puryear was transferred with nine other American officers to the POW camp in Villingen, arriving there on September 15. He escaped from Villingen on the night of October 6 and reached Switzerland on October 11.  The letter is marked &quot;Opened By Censor&quot; and addressed: &quot;Lieutenant Geo. W. Puryear, 95th Aero Squadron, Group I, American Prisoner of War, Kriegsgefengenenlager [sic] Rastatt, Baden Germany.&quot; Puryear had already been moved from Rastatt by the time the letter was sent, so the letter was forwarded to Landshut, and then to Villingen. It presumably arrived at Villingen after his escape because it is also marked &quot;c/o Alfred I. Puryear, A.S. [Air Service], Paris.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nine photographs of George W. Puryear and unidentified American pilots. The top middle photograph was taken in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. Middle: Frederick H. Morlan and George W. Puryear standing in front of what looks like a large metal storage tank.  Individual photograph descriptions: 

1.) George W. Puryear standing next to a Nieuport 28 fighter.  
2) Four unidentified American pilots standing in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.   
3) George W. Puryear standing next to a SPAD S.XIII fighter.  
4) Unidentified American pilot standing next to a French Voisin V bomber.  
5) Frederick H. Morlan and George W. Puryear standing in front of what appears to be a large storage tank.   
6) Unidentified American pilot sitting in the cockpit of a fighter. Note the round mirror attached to the top wing above the cockpit (in order to see if there is an enemy plane behind one).  
7) George W. Puryear sitting on the bottom wing of a French Salmson 2 reconnaissance plane.  
8) American ground crew preparing a SPAD S.XIII fighter.  
9) Unidentified American pilot sitting next to an unidentified woman.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Puryear arrived at Issoudon for flight training on December 15 and received his commission on January 8, 1918. He was put on active duty on January 11. After completing his flight training, he went to Cazaux for aerial gunnery training on March 6. He then served as a ferry pilot from May-July. Puryear reported to the 95th Aero Squadron on July 16 and was taken prisoner by the Germans on July 26. On October 6, he escaped from the POW camp at Villingen, Germany, and he reached Switzerland on October 11.  The view in second photograph is looking northeast down the Rue Royale towards the Église de la Madeleine. Behind them is the Fontaine des Fleuves (Fountain of River Commerce and Navigation). The building on the left is flying an American flag. On the Rue Royale side of that building (at No. 3 Rue Royale) is the famous Maxim's restaurant, which opened in 1893.  It is possible that they were in Paris visiting George's brother Alfred I. Puryear. Alfred was also a lieutenant in the Air Service during the war, but he wasn't a pilot. He joined the Stock Records Sub-Division, Material Division, Supply Section in January 1918. The Material Division was headquartered at 45 Avenue Montaigne in Paris (just a few blocks west of the Place de la Concorde).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eight photographs and one postcard on page. George W. Puryear with an unidentified woman. Two of the unidentified woman. Two of the unidentified woman with Alfred I. Puryear. Unidentified monument. One postcard of an aerodrome at Pontlevoy, France. George W. Puryear next to a SPAD S.XI reconnaissance airplane. Unidentified pilot next to a Salmson 2 reconnaissance airplane. Individual photograph descriptions: 

1) George W. Puryear &amp; unidentified woman standing at the base of the Eiffel Tower.   
2-3) Unidentified woman (the same woman in photographs 1-5).  
4) Unidentified woman with Alfred I. Puryear. For brothers who were born 5 years apart, George &amp; Alfred looked remarkably similar, so it is often difficult to tell them apart in the photographs. Note that the woman is wearing the same dress as in photograph 1, but there are no pilot's wings on Alfred's uniform. He did not earn his pilot's wings until 1921.  
5) Unidentified woman with Alfred I. Puryear.  
6) Picture postcard of the aerodrome at Pontlevoy, France &amp; addressed to Lt. H. V. Harding. Presumably, the two photographs attached to the postcard are of Lt. Harding.   
7) George W. Puryear standing next to a SPAD S.XI two-seat (or &quot;biplace&quot;) reconnaissance airplane.  
8) Unidentified Army Air Service pilot standing next to a Salmson 2 reconnaissance airplane.</dc:description>

<dc:description>George W. Puryear flew with the 95th Aero Squadron from July 16 until his capture on July 26. While Puryear was with the 95th, the squadron was flying from an airfield at Saints, France (about 32 miles ESE of Paris).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an airplane was disassembled for shipment between stations, the serial number of the airplane was chalked on the separate parts. If the SPAD in the photograph is serial number B1374, it would later be shipped to Ellington Field (Houston, Texas) for use by the Mid-West Flight of the Victory Loan war bond drive. The small black characters are thought to identify the painting specifications.</dc:description>

3) A Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; flying over the coast, probably near San Diego.

4) Army Air Service personnel gathered around a wrecked JN-4, probably at Rockwell Field.                                                                                                                                                                                                           5) Unidentified Army Air Service observer pilot sitting in the rear cockpit of a JN-4 in flight. North Island, Coronado, and San Diego Bay are visible behind the tail of the airplane.

6) A dog standing next to the wreckage of a JN-4, probably at Rockwell Field.

7) Unidentified Army Air Service pilot in the cockpit of his airplane.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Naval Air Station North Island and the Army Air Service's Rockwell Field were both located on North Island until 1935 when Rockwell Field closed and the Naval Air Station took over the entire island. The body of water separating North Island from Coronado was called the Spanish Bight. It was filled in by the U. S. Navy in 1943. On February 27, 1920, Major Rudolph W. Schroeder set the flight altitude record in a LUSAC-11 by climbing to 10,093 m (33,113 ft).   The Packard-Le Pére LUSAC-11 was based on a French design but was built in the U. S. during World War I. The Army Air Service ordered 3,525 of the airplanes, but the orders were canceled at the end of the war. Only 30 were actually built. On February 27, 1920, Major Rudolph W. Schroeder set the flight altitude record in a LUSAC-11 by climbing to 10,093 m (33,113 ft).</dc:description>

<dc:description>The 103rd Aero Squadron was formed in February 1918. The first pilots in the squadron came from the disbanded Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps (American volunteer pilots who flew for the French). The squadron's insignia was the same as the insignia used by the Lafayette Escadrille. In April 1924, the 103rd was consolidated with the 94th Aero Squadron (&quot;Hat in the Ring&quot;). The unit is now known as the 94th Fighter Squadron and is based at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Photographs 1, 2, and 5-8 were taken during the Victory Loan war bond drive, April-May 1919. Puryear was a pilot with the No. 3 (Far West) Flight of the Victory Loan tour. The Far West Flight traveled through California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona putting on air shows to encourage people to buy war bonds. The commanding officer was Major Carl A. Spaatz, who later commanded the U. S. Army Air Force in the European Theater during World War II. He became the first Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force. On April 12, 1919, Puryear flew a Fokker D.VII in the air show at San Francisco, California, for the Victory Loan tour and a photograph of him flying the D.VII appeared the next day in the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper. He is quoted in the accompanying article giving a fantastical account of his escape. On April 15, 1919, he participated in an air show at Reno, Nevada, for the Victory Loan tour.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Spad B9911 had a white nose ring and landing gear struts. The fuselage was also over-painted, obliterating the roundel. It lacks any windshield. Lieutenant Colonel William Thaw flew this airplane in air show at San Francisco, California. Captain Hoover flew it over Sacramento, California, and Reno, Nevada. Captain Lowell Smith would turn it on its back due to a forced landing in Portland, Oregon.</dc:description>

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
SPAD B9911 was unique in having the British roundel painted out on the fuselage sides, and the roundels on the wings repainted in American colors of red outer, blue middle, and white center. The nose, landing gear, wheels, and gas tank were also painted white. This SPAD was later wrecked in Portland, Oregon, when the propeller broke while Captain Lowell Smith was performing stunts over the city.</dc:description>

A special cab-forward locomotive had been used to pull the train over the high Sierras between Sacramento, California, and Sparks, Nevada. This was necessary to protect the crew from suffocation in the numerous tight snow sheds and tunnels. However, a conventional locomotive (as seen here) was used for the remainder of the trip.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Carl A. Spaatz was the commanding officer of the 13th Aero Squadron during World War I. He was also the commanding officer of the Far West Flight for the Victory Loan war bond drive. He added the 2nd &quot;a&quot; to his last name in 1937 in an attempt to get people to pronounce it correctly (&quot;spahtz&quot;). During World War II, he commanded the 8th Air Force from May to July 1942. On July 7, 1942, he was placed in command of all U. S. Army Air Force units in the European Theater of Operations. In September 1947, he was appointed by President Truman to be the first Chief of Staff of the U. S. Air Force. He retired on June 30, 1948.

William Thaw II enlisted in the French Foreign Legion at the outbreak of World War I. He joined the French Air Force in December 1914 and flew with Escadrille 6, Escadrille 42, and Escadrille 65. He is credited with being the first American to engage in aerial combat in the war.  Thaw eventually transferred to Escadrille 124. Escadrille 124 was a squadron composed of American volunteers and was nicknamed the Lafayette Escadrille. After the U. S. entered the war in 1917, the Lafayette Escadrille was disbanded and Thaw became the commanding officer of the 103rd Aero Squadron. He died of pneumonia on April 22, 1934.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Puryear Album 1, page 42</dc:title>
<dc:description>Three photographs and one document on page. Document was written by George Puryear and is a chronology of his military service from the date he volunteered until he joined the 95th Aero Squadron. Top left: Nieuport 28 fighter bearing the insignia of the 95th Aero Squadron (kicking mule) and #11 on the side. It is captioned, &quot;George's Plane [he was] captured in.&quot; Top right: unidentified woman. Bottom left: Possibly George Puryear holding a girl sitting on the fuselage of a Fokker D.VII (Victory Loan war bond drive).</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Nieuport 28 was not the airplane George Puryear was captured in. The 95th Aero Squadron was initially issued Nieuport 28s but had switched over to SPAD S.XIIIs by the time Puryear joined the squadron on July 16, 1918. A copy of the official incident report related to his capture is in Album 3, page 39; it states that he was flying a SPAD S.XIII (factory #15033 and plane #24). However, he may have received flight training in the Nieuport 28.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Photograph of Charles A. Lindbergh sitting in the cockpit of his airplane, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis,&quot; before leaving on his trans-Atlantic flight from New York to Paris. It is captioned, &quot;The one place Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh feels most at home.&quot; The photograph was cut out of an unknown periodical where it appeared after Lindbergh's return to the U.

<dc:description>Lindbergh flew from New York to Paris on May 20-21, 1927. He was promoted to colonel on June 7, 1927, after returning home to the U. S. It is unknown who added this photograph to George W.

<dc:description>On October 17, 1922, a strong gust of wind caught the airship C-2 as it was being maneuvered out of its hangar. It struck the hangar door, tearing the &quot;envelope&quot; open and igniting the hydrogen gas inside. After the destruction of the C-2, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy began converting all of their airships to use non-flammable helium gas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Clippings from &quot;Le Miroir des Sports&quot; (a weekly French sports magazine, 1920-1968) about the Gordon Bennett Cup Race. Clippings contain photographs of the race, the pliots, and the airplanes. Clippings also include a table with information about all the previous Gordon Bennett Cup races. See the &quot;Additional Information&quot; section at the end of the collection finding aid for an English translation of this clipping.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Gordon Bennett Cup was an international airplane race created by James Gordon Bennett, Jr., owner of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; newspaper. It was run every year from 1909 to 1913. The 1914 race was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I and was not run again until 1920. Rules stated that the trophy would stay with the country that won three consecutive races. Joseph Sadi-Lecointe won in 1920; it was the 3rd consecutive time a French pilot won it, so the trophy stayed with the Aero Club de France.</dc:description>

<dc:title>&quot;The Airman's Escape&quot;</dc:title>
<dc:description>&quot;The Airman's Escape&quot; is George W. Puryear's autobiographical account of his capture and escape from a German POW camp during World War I. His account appeared in the April 1919 (p. 452-462) and May 1919 (p. 615-628) issues of Atlantic Monthly magazine.  The pages were removed from the magazine and bound together into a booklet. The story is also reprinted (verbatim) as Appendix B in Harold Buckley's book &quot;Squadron 95&quot; (New York: Arno Press, 1972).</dc:description>
<dc:description>After completing pilot training at Issoudun and gunnery school at Cazaux, Puryear served a few months as a ferry pilot before being joining the 95th Aero Squadron on July 16, 1918. He was taken prisoner on July 26 and, after spending time in several POW camps, arrived at Villingen, Germany on September 15. Mass escape attempt made from camp on October 6. On October 11, Puryear swam across Rhine River at Waldshut, Germany to reach Switzerland, becoming first American officer in World War I to successfully escape from a German POW camp.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Map of southern Germany and northern Switzerland showing the route George W. Puryear took on his escape from the POW camp at Villingen, Germany. Villingen is circled on the map. The places where he stopped to sleep are also circled, and the date in October 1918 when he stopped there is written next to each circle. There are two X's across the Rhine from Waldshut, marking where he came out of the river and the house where he was first given aid.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After completing pilot training at Issoudun and gunnery school at Cazaux, Puryear served a few months as a ferry pilot before joining the 95th Aero Squadron on July 16, 1918. He was taken prisoner on July 26 and, after spending time in several POW camps, arrived at Villingen, Germany on September 15. Mass escape attempt made from camp on October 6. On October 11, Puryear swam across Rhine River at Waldshut, Germany to reach Switzerland, becoming first American officer in World War I to successfully escape from a German POW camp.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Both sides suffered appalling casualties on the Western Front. During the Third Battle of Ypres (1917), about 140,000 British soldiers were killed to gain five miles (or one soldier for every 2.25 inches). During the Battle of Verdun (1916), the French Army suffered 377,000 casualties and the German Army 337,000. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme (1916), the British Army suffered 60,000 casualties (roughly the population of the city of Franklin, Tennessee, in 2010).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lieutenant George W. Puryear standing behind a Nieuport 28 fighter plane.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Due to a shortage of American fighter planes, American fighter squadrons in France were given the French-built Nieuport 28 fighters beginning in March 1918. Due to a shortage of machine guns, the planes were equipped with only one gun each. While maneuverable and easy to fly, the Nieuport 28s had unreliable engines and were notorious for shedding the fabric on their upper wings in a steep dive. By the summer of 1918, American squadrons had replaced their Nieuport 28s with the SPAD S.XIII.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Photograph of the Puryear family graves in Gallatin Cemetery festooned with funeral wreaths. The large headstone in the center is possibly marks the grave of William Pressley Puryear (1843-1913). To the right is George W. Puryear's grave (at the; foot is a small sign which reads &quot;G. W. P.&quot;). While the photograph appears to be taken in spring/summer, given the climate of Middle Tennessee, it is possible that it was taken in October 1919 shortly after George's burial.</dc:description>
<dc:description>George W. Puryear was assigned to the 9th Aero Squadron at Rockwell Field, San Diego, Calif., soon after returning to the U.S. from World War I.

It was then sent to Gallatin for burial on October 28. An article in the October 28, 1919 issue of The Tennessean newspaper describes the procession in Memphis from the train station to David's house.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Four photographs of Mt. Wilson north of Arcadia, California.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Ross Field in Arcadia was the site of an Army Balloon School. Some sources list the school as closing in 1919, but photographs and documents in Albums 2 and 3 show that it was still in operation as late as 1921. Alfred Pruyrear went to balloon school there, beginning in either late 1920 or early 1921. He made his first solo flight on July 8, 1921, flying from Arcadia to Glendora, California.</dc:description>
