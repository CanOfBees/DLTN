<dc:description>General order No. 226 issued from E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant General of the United States Army, describing the proper ration of pork, soft bread, hard bread, beans, vegetables, rice, vinegar, coffee, candles, soap, salt, and pepper for each soldier.</dc:description>

<dc:description>General orders are published directives issued by a commander, binding upon all personnel under his command.  Soldiers of the Civil War, especially Federal soldiers with more effective logistics operations, seldom went hungry. The ration as ordered in General order No. 226 was fairly typical of the Federal ration during the war, and, while it could be reduced when necessary, it was often fulfilled effectively, minus perhaps only a sufficient amount of vegetables.</dc:description>

June 20th 1864
Circular
To officers Comdg. Troops doing duty as Engineers or Pioneers.
	The act of Congress lately passed authorizing the raising of an Engineer regiment permits the enlistment of all men who are or have been doing duty as Engineers, Pontoniers, or Pioneers.
	The original act sent to Washington was drafted by me and limited the men to be enlisted to present and former members of the Pioneeer Brigade. The act as passed was re-written in Washington and was not seen by me until after it had passed both houses and became a law.
	It would be manifestly unjust to insist upon the use of the full authority conferred by the law and therefore I have instructed all recruiting officers to decline enlisting any men from the Michigan Engineers, the 58th Indiana, or the Engineer Brigade who are not ex-Pioneers. As it would be legal, however, to do so I have authorized them to enlist other than ex-Pioneers on the written consent of regimental commanders.

<dc:description>In the early days of the war, the Confederacy allowed a limited substitution system. The first Confederate Conscription Act permitted substitutes from men not legally liable to service at the rate of one man a month in each company. The Second Conscription Act required men with substitutes again be eligible to serve, leading to much dissension and legal action. By late 1863 the Confederacy abolished the whole system. Scholars have never accurately compiled the number of substitutes.</dc:description>

Men on &quot;extra duty&quot; were not always freed from infantry service, especially those serving as teamsters, but others serving in special positions, such as mechanics, hospital staff, and engineers, were deemed more valuable in those roles than in the role of an infantry private.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Much of Shelby County fell under Federal control following the Federal naval attack on Memphis June 6, 1862.  General Order No. 5 issued by Governor/Commander-in-Chief Isham G. Harris and Adjutant General W. C. Whitthorne on March 24, 1862, organized the state's Reserve Military Corps as required by an act of the General Assembly, passed March 18, 1862.  This general order was issued from the Executive Headquarters at Memphis.  Thus, it is assumed this reserve roll was recorded prior to the occupation of Memphis and subjugation of much of Shelby County.</dc:description>

The directions to the mustering officer printed at the bottom of the form highlight the multiple copies that were produced of Civil War official military forms.  In this case, four copies were to be made and sent to the appropriate entities on national and state levels to ensure proper recording of enrollment and payment.</dc:description>

	The Ordnance Property taken up on this Return was “unserviceable” &amp; Dropped was rendered unserviceable from no neglect of those having it in charge-during the battle with Hood at Nashville on the 15th-16th-17th &amp; 18th Dec. 1864. The Muskets &amp; Accoutrements were old &amp; much worn when first Received and as the “Quartermaster’s Forces” were ordered out with both arms and intrenching tools. The Arms and Ammunition were unavoidably damaged by the wet weather while the Forces were hurriedly throwing up intrenchments.
	The 3000 Cartridges received from Capt. C. H. Irvin A. Q. M. as per Invoice dated Dec. 20th 1864 were invoiced as B. &amp; B. Cal. Cg – But on examination were found to be only 1000 B. &amp; B. Cal.

The detailed list showed the numbers of officers, non-commissioned officers, enlisted men, surgeons, etc., available within each company. Reports were issued daily to ensure that an accurate count was always available.  The &quot;Senior&quot; in this unit's designation indicates that it antedated lower-numbered Tennessee regiments in the Civil War.  The &quot;154&quot; comes from its 1842 founding as a Tennessee Militia regiment that incorporated in 1860. With the war, the unit reorganized at Randolph in Shelby County.</dc:description>

This marked the first time in the state's history that African Americans were to be included as members of the militia.</dc:description>

At the end of that month, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to the Federal troops.

General Orders )
No 11		 )
	The following extracts of a letter captured in the skirmish of the 14th inst. and written by one of the enemy are published for the information of the Soldiers of the army.
Perhaps you would lend me your attention for a few moments and let me recount the adventures &amp; moves &amp; draws of this “Left-wing army of the Ohio” we the 117 Regt. Indiana Vols Infy six month men have lead a checkered life for the past two &amp; one half months. We’ve seen that Elephant in a shape that few Indiana soldiers have seen him. We had seen fighting some of us. Our Col was in all the Vicksburg fights as Maj of the 8th but fighting of the soldiering by a long shot as you are well aware. In the last ten weeks we have marched nearly 500 miles and for the past two months have never drawn full rations. When we got to Morristown we were put on quarter rations. We went to Greensville 65 miles N.E. of Cumberland Gap and drew no rations for three days. Then drew meal and ¾ rations of fresh beef without salt. Corn had been issued to us as rations and we have had for days at a time absolutely nothing but parched corn and beef. Forty rounds of parched corn in your Haversacks was an order from Sergt Berry to his squad about a month ago. And it has passed into the Regt as a general order for every march. We retreated from Greenville on a run to Bull’s Gap which we commenced fortifying and the paper stated our position as impregnable

[Page 2 of 3]

Before the Telegraph had given publicity to the news our impregnable position was evacuated and we are “Skedaddling” for Cumberland Gap. We had nothing to eat there for several days except a little and once or twice some parched corn. Our Brigade goes among the troops by the name of the Parched Corn Brigade Wilcox’s running Tigers. &amp; the Lank Expectant Hoosey. We have been four times in hearing of several sharp little fights one in sight. But never yet in a skirmish. We marched &amp; countermarched advanced and retreated and have killed a good many men by foolish running and unnecessary starvation. We went beyond Cumberland Gap into Ky. &amp; there we went two days with nothing to eat save parched corn &amp; meat which we foraged for. We drew some flour there that just lammed it to any thing you ever saw. If you would take the screenings from a flowering mill &amp; to one bushel add a peck of oats &amp; another peck of dirt &amp; grind it all &amp; you have a bushel &amp; a half of the kind of flour that was issued to us on Yellow Creek Ky. I have a specimen of the bread &amp; will save it until we the 117th Reg Ind Vol Infy.  – d—d six months (that’s or title, the swearing is not mine) are mustered out exhibited it in Indiana &amp; then send it to Barnum for his celebrated museum. Strady hast.
Quick ! Marching orders! We left Clich river on the 10th and advanced to the top of this mountain six miles from old camps. We are incamped right square in the gap where the wind whistles &amp; [blows?] &amp; cuts our cloths of our backs. It is awful cold here. Where at the base of the mountain it is as warm as summer. Rebs left here the day before we got here. They had several thousand at Beans Station

[Page 3 of 3]

The publication of the forgoing letter has been suggested by the knowledge of your own hardships &amp; perils &amp; that you might compare them with those of the enemy. And [see?] that they too have their privations which according to the writer of this letter far exceeds our own. If those who come upon our soil to invade us with the avowed purpose of subjugation can carry out their work under such trials, &amp; with such gayety &amp; cheerfulness as this letter exhibits far much more of that endurance, patience, &amp; hope should you have, who are resisting tyranny and are fighting for you honor your homes &amp; your liberty. Let it not be said that the heart of the invader is stronger &amp; stouter than the determination of you, who fight for your all.
	Your wants are known to your Gen and every effort has been made to relieve them. Supplies of clothing &amp; shoes have been ordered and are daily expected until they arrive you are called upon to support the signs of a severe and trying campaign, with the same manly fortitude &amp; patience that has always been so honorable to you

Research shows younger Civil War soldiers who saw more comrades die or who were POWs had increased physical and mental ailments later in life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>At the time of an enlisted man's discharge from service, his company commander would ordinarily furnish him with his certificate of accounts.  In this case, Bolton's information has been filed in duplicate at Dalton Hospital in Georgia, probably the place where he was treated and obtained the surgeon's certificate.   His post commander signs for him, rather than his company commander, indicating why he cannot furnish a descriptive roll or a final statement upon discharge.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Certificate of parole for Leander H. Russ, a cavalry escort of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, from Camp Chase, Ohio, issued by W. P. Richardson, Commandant of Prisons. The certificate includes a physical description of Russ and a notarized letter from Russ, signed in 1924, correcting his military record --the muster roll of Forrest's escort had incorrectly reported that he had deserted.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The parole certificate includes an oath to faithfully support the federal government and the proclamations of the President issued during the rebellion. This parole is not to be confused with the official oath of allegiance many confederate soldiers signed upon surrender in 1865, but it performs the same function.</dc:description>

<dc:description>By definition, a ration is the amount of food authorized for one soldier (or animal) for one day.  The Confederate government adopted the official U. S. Army ration at the start of the war, although by the spring of 1862 they had to reduce the amount because of food shortages that affected not only the military but also the entire Southern civilian population.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the Civil War federal officials recognized a need for new laws to deal with rebellious acts of members of the Southern population. Because treason seemed too strong an offense, and death too severe a penalty for many of the acts in support of the Confederate cause, the Congress passed acts of July 31, 1861, and July 17, 1862, that fixed penalties for the lesser crimes of conspiracy and rebellion. The latter act also provided for future pardon and amnesty.</dc:description>

The commanding officer usually called together a group of three officers to evaluate the property, determine the extent of the loss, and assign responsibility for the loss. The appointment of an inspector would follow, with that inspector assessing value and ruling on the property's condemnation or disposal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Four Catholic Dominican sisters from Somerset, Ohio, founded St. Cecilia as a female school in 1860, and the first class graduated in 1862.  Students from both Tennessee and other states displayed divided loyalties during the Civil War. The fall of the city in 1862 brought federal sentinels to the gates of the institution for the rest of the war. The guards proved a benefit to the academy, allowing it to remain open for the duration of the conflict.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The U. S. Army relied heavily on impressed goods while on campaign.  While the Quartermaster furnished rations and other goods for the army, many items, such as horses, mules, wood, and animal feeds, were often taken from local populations. The U.
