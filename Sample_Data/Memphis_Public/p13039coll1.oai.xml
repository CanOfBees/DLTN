<dc:title>African American Life in Memphis, Tennessee: A Compilation of Collections</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B4-B5</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The African American Life in Memphis, Tennessee collection touches on the vast contributions of African Americans in the Bluff City.  The papers address the early struggles of African American and reflect the rich and productive lives they have led in Memphis.  The extensive collection is divided into portions on the arts, business, medicine, politics and religion, and covers events from the beginning to the end of the 20th century.  The papers serve as a valuable resource for researchers who wish to understand the significant contributions African Americans have made to the city. -- African Americans have had an immeasurable impact on the arts in Memphis, and the collection contains a section of material on musicians, actors, visual artists and dancers who have lived in Memphis and traveled through the city.  This section also provides significant historical information on Memphis’ role in the development of jazz and the creation of the blues as a distinct musical form. -- The section related to business includes articles on individuals such as J.E. Walker, founder of Universal Life Insurance Company, which provide insight into the entrepreneurial spirit of African Americans in Memphis.  The portion of the collection devoted to medicine includes information dating back to the Memphis Cooperative Drug Company which was founded at the beginning of the century, as well as articles that relate to the creation of Champion Pharmacy in the 1980s. -- The papers include programs from various events sponsored by the local chapter of the NAACP.  Also included are several minute books from the historic Beale Street Baptist Church that date back to 1901.  The portion of the collection focusing on religion also contains numerous church histories, as well as an assortment of church anniversary booklets that also provide some information on individual families.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Catholic Human Relations Council Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Catholic Human Relations Council was founded in Memphis in 1962 in an effort to unite black and white Catholics in the city and to increase the role of the Catholic Church in the Civil Rights movement. Through the 1960s and early 1970s, the CHRC sought to increase communication and respect between people of different races and creeds. The members believed in the inherent worth of all people, and they were dedicated to brotherhood, equality and justice. They were committed to the Judeo-Christian heritage, and they worked to achieve full access and participation for all Catholics in the workings of the Church. The organization wanted the Catholic Church in Memphis to use its strength and influence to help bring about justice for all citizens of the city. -- The papers of the CHRC, which were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by a former officer of the organization, include meeting minutes, correspondence, membership rosters, newsletters, financial records, newspaper clippings and other records. This collection would be of special interest to researchers interested in the Civil Rights movement in Memphis in the 1960s and 1970s and grassroots movements committed to social justice.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Piggly Wiggly Grocery Store Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Piggly Wiggly Grocery Store Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center by Dr. James R. Johnson in 2008. Comprising 1.25 linear feet, the Piggly Wiggly Grocery Store Collection contains business reports, correspondence, news releases, newspaper and magazine articles, and photographs related to the development of one of the most successful grocery store chains in the history of the United States. In addition to material regarding the grocery store, the collection also includes information on the merger between Malone and Hyde and Piggly Wiggly Corporation in 1982 and the Piggly Wiggly Exhibit housed in the Memphis Pink Palace Museum which opened on July 18, 1980. -- On September 11, 1916, entrepreneur Clarence Saunders opened the first Piggly Wiggly grocery store at 79 Jefferson Street in downtown Memphis. Born in Amherst, Virginia on August 9, 1881, Clarence Saunders owned a successful wholesale grocery business before founding Piggly Wiggly. Unlike the grocery stores that Saunders’ had sold goods to, the Piggly Wiggly store allowed customers to pick and choose the merchandise they wanted instead of waiting for a clerk to provide service. Saunders’ self-service concept was so popular that within a few months he opened several other stores around Memphis. He soon spread Piggly Wiggly stores to other cities and by 1922 there were 1,241 groceries in forty states which did a yearly business of nearly $100 million. -- In 1922 Saunders lost control of Piggly Wiggly and declared bankruptcy after a failed attempt to control all of the corporation’s stock. In 1928 the Kroger grocery store chain acquired Piggly Wiggly, continuing to operate many of the stores until the late 1930s when financier W. R. Lovett of Jacksonville, Florida purchased controlling stock in the company. Lovett operated the Piggly Wiggly Corporation until his death in 1978. In 1982, Memphis-based Malone and Hyde, Inc., the nation’s fourth largest grocery wholesaler purchased the Piggly Wiggly Corporation. The grocery stores founded by Clarence Saunders revolutionized the way Americans shop for food and continue to provide self-service well into the 21st Century. -- Researchers interested in the history of Memphis businesses will also want to consult the Brennan-Thomas Collection, the Business Papers of Samuel B. Williamson, Napoleon Hill and Noland Fontaine, the Goldsmith’s Department Store Collection and the South Memphis Land Company Collection also housed in the Memphis and Shelby Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>General Gideon J. Pillow Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J12</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Gideon Johnson Pillow was born in 1806 near Columbia, Tennessee.  He attended the University of Nashville and went on to practice law in Columbia with his good friend James K. Polk.  Pillow and his wife Mary Martin Pillow had 14 children. -- Pillow was active in the Tennessee militia, and was named brigadier general by Polk at the beginning of the Mexican War.  He served as second in command to General Winfield Scott and took part in the siege of Vera Cruz and battles at Cerro Gordo, Chapleted and Contreras.  Pillow frequently clashed with Scott and charges of insubordination were brought against him amid the “Leonidas Letter” scandal.  This mysterious letter appeared in the Delta, a New Orleans-based journal, and praised Pillow’s actions at the Battle of Contreras while trivializing General Scott’s involvement.  The court failed to prove any connection between Pillow and the letter and he was acquitted by the military commission and exonerated by President Polk.  Pillow returned to Columbia to resume practicing law.  He later became active in national politics and was considered as a possible candidate for vice president in 1852 and 1856. -- Although originally opposed to secession at the outbreak of the Civil War, Pillow was appointed in 1861 as commander of the Provisional Army of Tennessee, which was headquartered in Memphis.  He supervised the construction of fortifications on the Mississippi River bluffs and trained troops for the defense of western Tennessee.  He was relieved of active command following the surrender of Fort Donelson in 1862 and spent the remainder of the war serving in the Conscript Bureau. -- Returning to Memphis after the war, Pillow again took up the practice of law and formed a partnership with former Governor Islam G. Harris.  However, the war left him deeply in debt and he was forced into bankruptcy.  His last years were spent running the Mound Plantation near Helena, Arkansas, where he died of yellow fever during the epidemic of 1878. -- The Pillow papers were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mary Lou Pillow on behalf of her late husband, Gideon Johnson Pillow, III, the general’s grandson.  Most of the papers date from the last years of Pillow’s life – 1870 to 1878, and include legal documents, correspondence and financial records.  The papers cover Pillow’s life as a landowner, an attorney and a family man.  The collection also includes two of the General’s leather cases and a rare copy of the Proceedings of a Court of Inquiry in the Case of Major General Gideon J. Pillow, the record of Pillow’s trial on insubordination charges during the Mexican War. -- In 1978 Mr. and Mrs. William W. Goodman donated a manuscript collection to the Memphis and Shelby County Room containing a series of letters and dispatches written by Gideon Pillow when he was commander of the Provisional Army of Tennessee.  The letters document Pillow’s efforts to raise and equip an army and his ambitious plan to invade and occupy parts of Kentucky and Missouri.  The Goodman collection also includes a steel engraving of Pillow by H.S. Sudd and a book containing a biographical sketch of Pillow’s early life and his personal statement before the military court during the Mexican War.  The papers donated by the Goodmans are housed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room with the other Pillow material.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Playhouse on the Square Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Playhouse on the Square Programs Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library &amp; Information Center by several individuals over many years.  The programs were then gathered together to create this collection. -- In 1975, Circuit Playhouse, Inc. acquired a building in Overton Square in Midtown Memphis. With $30,000 provided by Overton Square Investors for renovation, and with increased funding from the Memphis Arts Council, Playhouse on the Square was born. It was an offspring of Circuit Playhouse, Inc. which continued to produce the kind of adventurous theatre its audience had come to expect. Playhouse on the Square opened on November 12, 1975 with a production of “Godspell.” -- This collection contains assorted theater programs from 1975 through 2003.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The James J. Pleasants, Jr. Papers were donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center in the 1970s by the City of Memphis.  Comprising 8.75 linear feet, the Pleasants Papers cover the years 1947-1948 and include correspondence, government reports, blueprints, drawings and photographs related to Pleasants’ career as mayor of the City of Memphis.

<dc:title>Susanne Conlan Scruggs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R20-R21</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Susanne Conlan was born in Boston in 1863.  She came to Memphis in 1889 following her marriage to Thomas Murphy Scruggs, a prominent Memphis attorney who later became a judge.  Susanne Scruggs was active in the Progressive Movement in Memphis, and she worked tirelessly on behalf of disadvantaged people, especially children.  She focused on providing safe places for children to play, access to quality education and legal representation through a juvenile court system. -- Scruggs’ work toward improving education and conditions in schools involved the founding of Memphis Woman’s Public School Association, which helped provide free school books to children who could not afford them.  She also organized school lunch programs, was active in the formation of several Parent-Teacher Associations and served as president of the Central High PTA. -- Scruggs helped improve the health and welfare of children in Memphis by founding the Playground Association to provide safe places for children to play.  She also worked to establish the first children’s ward in the City of Memphis Hospital and centers to care for people suffering from tuberculosis and pellagra, a condition caused by a Vitamin B deficiency which was prevalent among the poor.  As the first president of the Children’s Protective Union, Scruggs found adoptive homes for many children, and through the “Friendly Visitor” program, she and other volunteers made visits to the homes of the poor to ensure that the children had proper care.  Additionally, Scruggs was instrumental in the organization of the Juvenile Court system and served as an officer of the Juvenile Court. -- The Susanne Conlan Scruggs Collection contains photograph albums, newspaper clippings, correspondence, photographs and other documents that describe Scruggs’s efforts on behalf of children.  The albums include a variety of photographs which show dilapidated housing and children playing in unsafe parks.  The correspondence includes letters Scruggs exchanged with educators, doctors, politicians and others involved in the health and welfare of children.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Price/Davis Family Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O12</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Davis family and the Price family were joined when Carolina “Callie” Price married William G. Davis in 1879.  William and Callie decided to raise their family in Gibson Station in Gibson County.  The Price/Davis Family Papers date from 1841 to 1937 and primarily consist of correspondence.  The bulk of the letters in the collection were exchanged between friends and family of William and Callie and their children.  Members of the Hammerly family of Alabama and the Rawlins family of New Orleans, who were cousins of the Price branch of the family, frequently wrote to the Davis family and to Callie’s brother, L.D. Price of Stanton, Tennessee, and these letters are also included in the collection. -- The letters represent the type of correspondence produced by a typical West Tennessee farming family.  The family members wrote to each other about farming, the weather and illness.  In addition to correspondence, the papers include essays, photographs, journals, newspaper clippings, records of business transactions and copies of sermons.  The collection was acquired through the generous gift of Mrs. Ann Stavley of Cordova, Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Julia Raine Collection of Correspondence and Music</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Julia Woodward, an important figure in the local and national music community, was born in Memphis in 1857.  She studied music at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and went on to become an accomplished composer.  She wrote the Tennessee Centennial Hymn, In Tennessee, while she was living in Brooklyn, New York and homesick for her home state.  A piece she composed for organ was played at a service in Westminster Abbey in London and her compositions were performed by well-known musicians including Victor Herbert and Sir Harry Lauder. -- Julia was living in Memphis in 1877 when she married Gilbert D. Raine, who was one of the founders of the Commercial Publishing Company and later published the News-Scimitar.  The marriage was evidently not a happy one.  In 1910 Julia wrote a pamphlet entitled In Nineteen-Ten: A Protest against Conditions in Tennessee, in which she laments the circumstances of married women.  The Julia Raine Collection of Correspondence and Music includes a copy of the pamphlet with a copy of the license for her marriage to Gilbert attached to the inside cover. -- Gilbert and Julia seem to have parted ways, yet Julia apparently changed her mind about marriage and went on to marry Joseph Henry Hawley in 1912.  Gilbert retired from publishing in 1914 and moved to Bartlett.  He spent the last two years before his death in 1924 at the Wallace-Somerville Sanatorium. -- Julia and Joseph moved around a great deal.  They lived together and separately in several residences in Memphis and also lived in Galveston and Houston, Texas.  Julia periodically went by the name Julia Hawley, but it was as Julia Raine that she became a Memphis radio personality.  At the age of 73, she began appearing on a successful weekly radio program known as “Grandmother’s Hour,”  which was broadcast from the WREC studios at the Peabody Hotel.  In addition to enjoying her success on the radio, Julia was active in the Beethoven Club and played the organ for a number of Memphis churches.  She often played piano in her home, and people walking by enjoyed her playing so much they called her ” The Lady Who Sings with Her Fingers.”  Julia died in 1937 at the age of 80 and is buried at Elmwood Cemetery. -- The Julia Raine Collection of Correspondence and Music has been held by the Memphis and Shelby County Room for a number of years, and it is no longer known who donated the material.  The collection consists of sheet music, articles and letters related to Julia’s musical career.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Papers of the Raleigh Community Council</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Raleigh Community Council (RCC) was formed in 1971 under the leadership of Donald “Don” R. Anderson to unite community organizations and focus their activities to better serve the Raleigh area.  The Raleigh chapters of the Jaycees and the Kiwanis Club joined with Parent Teacher Associations of area schools to pool their resources and coordinate planning to improve the community. -- The importance of the RCC became apparent in 1972 when the City Council announced that Memphis would annex the Raleigh area.  The RCC took an active role in protecting Raleigh’s interests during the annexation process.  The RCC’s cooperation with city officials and its limited participation in City Council activities helped facilitate a smooth transition for Raleigh into the Memphis city government. -- This collection of papers, covering RCC activity from 1971 through 1976, chronicles the first few years of Raleigh’s inclusion in the Memphis municipal system.  The collection is arranged according to the various projects undertaken by the RCC, including its vigorous efforts to preserve Raleigh’s historic sites, monitor zoning ordinances and provide adequate roads and traffic safety.  Of particular interest are files which describe the RCC’s attempts to have a major hospital constructed for the Raleigh area, which was accomplished in the building of Methodist Hospital North.  Also significant is the material relating to the implementation of busing to schools in the area beginning with the 1973 school year.  In addition, the collection contains the Minute Book of the Raleigh Utility District which covers meetings from January 4, 1967 through August 16, 1973, at which time the District functions, rights, duties and assets were by resolution turned over to the City of Memphis.  Many of the documents illustrate the efforts of Don Anderson, who demonstrated outstanding personal initiative and leadership skills in protecting the interests of the Raleigh community through the RCC.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Office Files of John &quot;Jack&quot; W. Ramsey</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G-98</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Jack Ramsay was born in 1901 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, but moved to the Memphis area as a small child.  He attended Messick School, Memphis University School, West Tennessee State Normal School (now the University of Memphis), and the University of the South.  He later earned a law degree from the University of Memphis Law School by attending school at night and working in the cotton industry during the day. -- Although he passed the bar, Ramsay never practiced law.  Instead, he stayed in the cotton business and went on to found the Ramsay-Austin Cotton Company.  He served as its president until 1962, when he entered politics. -- As an active member of an organization that was involved in the promotion of better government for Memphis and Shelby County, Ramsay served on a committee charged with finding suitable candidates to run for County Commissioner.  Ramsay was drafted to run for Commissioner by his fellow committee members.  He won the election in 1962, and was chosen to serve as Chair of the Commission. -- Ramsay planned to serve only two years, with the expectation that once a referendum could be held, consolidation of city and county governments would take place.  However, Shelby County citizens voted twice against consolidation.  Ramsay stayed on as Chair of the Commission until 1974.  He retired from county government in 1975, after supporting the restructuring of county government and serving as Chair of the County Executive Committee during the transition period. -- As both private citizen and public official, Ramsay was involved in professional, charitable and civic organizations, often serving as director, president, or chair.  He was particularly active in Junior Achievement and organizations relating to the cotton industry, agriculture and conservation. -- Jack Ramsay donated his office files to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1977.  The files include newspaper clippings, correspondence, meeting agendas and reports and a transcript and taped interview with Ramsay conducted by staff from the Memphis and Shelby County Room.  The papers contain numerous valuable insights into the day-to-day operation of county government and the relationship of the government with local business and civic organizations.  The papers illustrate Ramsey’s transition from business executive to effective county politician and describe his duties as Commission Chairman.  The papers contain material on numerous aspects of county administration including the development of Shelby Farms, industrial development, roads and traffic safety, the remodeling of the courthouse, the county budget, and tourism.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Bond Family Collection: A Bartlett Family</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Among the most prominent citizens of early Shelby County were three brothers, Samuel, John and Washington Bond. Samuel, born in 1804, was a practicing physician. During the late 1840s or early 1850s, he and his wife, Mary Lucy, built a splendid home called “The Avenue” in what is now the Ellendale section of Shelby County. The home, now called “Cedar Hall” for the trees lining the drive, still stands, and has been restored to appear much as it did when it was the residence of Samuel Bond. Samuel’s granddaughter, Kate Bond, who died in 1974 at age 88, was a prominent member of the Bartlett community. The “Flower Lady,” as Kate was known, was an avid gardener and supplied many of the hotels in Memphis, including the Peabody, with flowers. -- John Bond, born in 1808, earned his Ph.D. and became a respected educator and farmer. Washington Bond, who was born in 1814, served a year in the state legislature, practiced medicine and was a partner in the Bond and Odell Dry Goods store. Washington was also a successful farmer, and went on to win a medal for cotton at the London Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851. -- The Bond family helped found and donated the land for Green Bottom Church, which was later renamed Morning Sun Cumberland Presbyterian Church. They also played a large role in bringing the first railroad to Shelby County. The Memphis &amp; Ohio Railroad stretched from Memphis to Paris and the depot was named Bond’s Station. The Louisville &amp; Nashville, or L&amp;N Railroad, bought the Memphis &amp; Ohio Railroad and sponsored a contest to rename the community. The railroad chose “Ellendale” – a play-on-words of the abbreviation L&amp;N – as the winning entry. The Bond Family Collection includes correspondence, business and legal records and photographs. The papers provide insight into the issues and the difficulties encountered by farmers, store keepers and physicians of the time. Slaves of the Bond family were freed before the Civil War, but stayed on to work the land. Names of a number of the family’s field hands appear in the collection. -- The papers cover up to the early 20th century and include the William Sidney Bond scrapbook. William Sidney was a popular Southern author of the 20th century, and his scrapbook contains reviews, biographical notes, newspaper clippings and photographs. Also included in the collection are small photographs and other information on Kate Bond, the “Flower Lady.” -- The Bond papers supplement the information found in other family collections in the Memphis and Shelby County Room such as the Connor, Gilbert and Farrow collections and particularly The Ida Cooper Collection, which contains biographical information on the Bond family. Also of interest is the daybook of Washington Bond. The daybook, which covers the years 1837 to 1847, and lists patient names and the medicines he prescribed, provides a detailed record of medical treatment in the early 19th century. The manuscript has been transcribed, abstracted and indexed by Mary Louise Nazor and cataloged separately in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R18-R19</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Danny Thomas was one of nine children of Lebanese immigrants.  He was born Muzyad Makhoob in 1914 in Deerfield, Michigan and was raised in a loving, yet poverty-stricken home in Toledo, Ohio.  His name was Americanized to Amos Jacobs, but in 1940 he created his stage name by merging the first names of two of his brothers. -- In the late 1930s, Thomas was a struggling comic who felt his career had stalled.  His wife was expecting their first child and he had to decide whether to stay in show business or find another career that would support his young family.  Thomas prayed to St. Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes, and vowed to build a shrine to St. Jude if he found success in his career.  A short time later he achieved his first big break as a comic at the 5100 Club in Chicago. -- Thomas went on to achieve great success in show business.  He starred in the situation comedy Make Room For Daddy, which was later called The Danny Thomas Show.  He also produced The Andy Griffith Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show. -- After his career developed he discussed his vow to St. Jude with his friend, Cardinal Samuel Stritch of Chicago.  Thomas had heard the story of an injured black teenager who had bled to death because he was denied treatment at several southern hospitals.  “I decided that day I was going to build a hospital in the South where they would treat anybody – white, black, green, or sky-blue pink.”  Cardinal Stritch suggested that the hospital be built in Memphis where he had been a priest at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church.  Thomas first visited Memphis in 1955.  Groundbreaking took place in 1958 and St. Jude opened in 1962. -- St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has achieved international recognition as the world’s largest center for the treatment of childhood cancer and other catastrophic diseases.  St. Jude provides total medical care without cost to patients who are referred by a physician and who have a disease that is under study at the hospital.  It is the first institution established for the sole purpose of conducting basic and clinical research in catastrophic childhood diseases.  The research findings and accomplishments are freely shared with physicians and research scientists throughout the world. -- Although Thomas raised enough money through his own efforts to establish St. Jude, he turned to Americans who shared his heritage and founded ALSAC, the American-Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, which became the fund-raising arm of the institution.  For several years Thomas sponsored the Shower of Stars fund-raising gala for the hospital, and entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Sammy Davis, Jr. participated in the events.  In 1970 he began hosting the Danny Thomas Annual Golf Tournament which later became the Federal Express St. Jude Classic. -- Throughout his career, Thomas received numerous national and local awards for his work with St. Jude.  The city of Memphis showed its gratitude in 1966 by naming Danny Thomas Boulevard in his honor.  He was presented an honorary doctor of humanities degree by Christian Brothers College in 1968 and received the first Marguerite Piazza Humanitarian Award in 1989.  Danny Thomas died in 1991 and was entombed in a special crypt located beneath the golden dome of the hospital pavilion. -- The initial donation of material in this collection came from D.J.V. Simone, Director of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.  Additions to the collection have come from other sources, including the Archives of the Public Library.  The collection, which includes photographs, annual reports, brochures and newspaper clippings, documents the founding of the hospital and its expansion and describes the work of hospital staff in making Danny Thomas’ dream a reality.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Yellow Fever Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s Memphis was devastated by a series of deadly yellow fever epidemics.  The disease, which was spread by mosquitoes, caused nausea, vomiting and delirium and destroyed cells in the liver, which cause the victim’s skin and eyes to yellow.  At the time of the epidemics, it was not known what caused yellow fever, and cannons were set off, piles of debris were burned and the wooden streets were covered in lime in hopes of stopping the spread of the disease.  Many religious groups and fraternal organizations, including the Howard Association, a group made up of young businessmen, dedicated their time and energy to providing relief to the sick and the dying.  Numerous clergy members and nuns worked tirelessly to help the sick, and many died while providing aid to others.  The 1878 outbreak, during which between 30,000 and 50,000 people fled the city and over 5,000 died, was the deadliest of the epidemics.  The economy and population of Memphis was so devastated by the yellow fever epidemics, the city lost its charter and was declared a taxing district until 1893. -- The Yellow Fever Collection is comprised of a diary, correspondence, telegrams, newspaper clippings, death notices, a scrapbook and texts from memorials to those who died during the epidemics, particularly the medical professionals and nuns and clergy members who lost their lives while helping bring relief to others suffering from yellow fever. -- The Yellow Fever Collection also contains four additional collections or donations which have been organized and indexed in a single finding aid to assist those who are researching this catastrophic event in the history of Memphis.  The Reverend Charles Carroll Parsons Collection, The Reverend Louis Sandford Schuyler Collection, The William Teasley Berlin Family Letters Collection and The Howard Association Collection each relate to the epidemics in Memphis and are referenced in one finding aid along with the material gathered in The Yellow Fever Collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Order of the Alhambra Talavera Caravan #32</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Order of the Alhambra was founded by William Harper Bennett in Brooklyn, New York in 1904 as a Catholic fraternal and social organization.  The founders named the group after the Alhambra Palace in Grenada, Spain, where the Moors surrendered in 1492 to Ferdinand and Isabella after having occupied Spain for almost 800 years.  In addition to its social function, the Order of the Alhambra worked to raise funds to preserve Catholic historical sites in America.  Branches of the organization, called Caravans, which were each given a name of Moorish origin, were established throughout the United States and Canada. -- The Order of the Alhambra Talavera Caravan, #32 was established in Memphis in 1915, and many prominent Catholic men became members.  Membership declined during World War I and the passage of prohibition meant that members could no longer enjoy alcoholic drinks during meetings.  National officers encouraged Caravan members to remember that that the organization had important goals other than imbibing and interacting socially, and some local leaders attempted to rally the inactive members.  Yet the effects of the war and declining interest in the elaborate, complicated and highly-structured activities of the group led to its demise.  There is no evidence that Talavera Caravan, #32 existed after 1919.  The papers of the Talavera Caravan, #32 include letters, receipts, and meeting notices and brochures from other Caravans.  The collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by an unknown donor. -- The International Order of Alhambra remains an active fraternal organization dedicated to assisting people with mental retardation by providing education and support.  Their mission also includes preserving Catholic history by identifying, conserving and commemorating Catholic landmarks, people and events.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Tennessee Valley Authority Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R28</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Paul Coppock joined the Commercial Appeal as a cub reporter in 1929, and during the thirties he reported on Memphis and Shelby County government.  In the early 1940s he became city night editor, and it was during this time he began to write “The Night Desk,” a question and answer column.  He became an editorial writer in 1952 and served in that position until his retirement in 1972.  He continued to contribute to the paper, however, until 1982,  writing the Sunday column, “Mid-South Memoirs.”  This column and his interest in Memphis history gave rise to three books, Memphis Sketches, Memphis Memoirs and Paul R. Coppock’s Midsouth. -- Summing up his career on his retirement from the Commercial Appeal, Coppock stated, “I think I worked hardest and got the most satisfaction in helping defeat the proposed Dixon-Yates power plant.”  Coppock’s long-time interest in public utilities, particularly as they affected Memphis, led him to write about and collect material related to TVA, Memphis Light Gas &amp; Water and related subjects.  This material was compiled as The Tennessee Valley Authority Collection and was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1972 by Coppock just before his retirement from the Commercial Appeal. -- In 1954, it was proposed that the Dixon-Yates power plant be built in West Memphis, Arkansas, as an alternative to TVA to provide a power source for Memphis.  The federal government, including President Eisenhower, supported the construction of the Dixon-Yates plant to guard against power shortages in Memphis.  Yet the citizens of Memphis, led by Mayor Frank Tobey, opposed the abandonment of TVA as the provider of the city’s power.  Tobey testified before Congress to contest the Dixon-Yates contract, and the Thomas Allen Steam Plant was built in Memphis as a TVA facility to provide expanded power resources for the city.  The contract for the construction of Dixon-Yates was eventually defeated, and Memphis continued to use TVA as its power source -- The battle over the Dixon-Yates contract is well documented in The Tennessee Valley Authority Collection, which consists of news clippings and editorials from the Commercial Appeal and other newspapers, as well as a variety of related articles, reports and correspondence.  Construction of the Thomas Allen Steam Plant, the evolution of the Memphis, Light Gas &amp; Water Division, and issues such as disputes over financing and tax payments are documented in newspaper clippings and copies of financial and feasibility studies.  Also included is general information on public and private utilities which was provided by the utility companies themselves or clipped from trade publications.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Theatre Memphis Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R28-R29</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Theatre Memphis Programs Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center by many individual donors over several years.  Consisting of programs from performances at Theatre Memphis between the years 1975 and 2007, the collection provides invaluable information on the operation of community theatre in Memphis.  Each program includes the names of the director, cast and crew as well as information on the production. -- Theatre Memphis was established as the Little Theatre in 1921.  For several years, plays were performed in a variety of locations in Memphis including Germania Hall and the Nineteenth Century Club.  In 1929, the Little Theatre was headquartered at the Pink Palace Museum Playhouse where they would remain until the mid-1970s.  When the Pink Palace closed for renovations, the theatrical company opened their own venue on Perkins Extended in East Memphis.  Changing their name to Theatre Memphis, productions resumed in 1975 and have continued to the present day.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Frank Tobey Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J1-J10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Frank T. Tobey was born in 1890 in Memphis and attended the Memphis Military Institute, Christian Brothers College and Captain Collier’s School.  He pursued studies in engineering at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, South Dakota State School of Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota and then at the University of Washington at Seattle.  Upon completion of his studies, Tobey formed an engineering partnership with E.H. Porter, and at his partner’s death, moved to Huntingdon, Tennessee, where he served as chief engineer for 32 drainage districts. -- Tobey began his career with the city of Memphis in 1924 as the chief of an engineering survey party.  He became chief clerk in the City Engineering Department in 1928, and then became the Comptroller.  In this position, Toby conducted numerous financial studies and surveys.  He served as Comptroller until 1951, when he was elected to the office of Commissioner of Finances and Institutions with the support of the extremely powerful and influential political leader E.H. Crump. -- In this same election, Watkins Overton, who held a weak alliance with Crump, was elected mayor of Memphis.  Overton went on to resign as mayor in 1953 in the wake of a falling out with Crump over the firing of Stanley Dillard as the City Personnel Director, who Overton had personally appointed.  Tobey was chosen as Overton’s successor as mayor with Crump’s support. -- Crump had closely controlled how the mayor’s office was run, yet shortly after Tobey assumed office, Crump became ill, and was not accessible to Tobey for advice on how to serve as mayor.  Tobey established an open-door policy in the mayor’s office and began to increase his number of public appearances.  These practices helped increase Tobey’s popularity, yet alienated him from Crump, who felt Tobey was no longer committed to his political organization or willing to accept his advice. -- Despite being at odds with Crump, Tobey went on to enjoy great success as mayor.  One of his major accomplishments was the defeat of the contract for the construction of the Dixon-Yates power plant.  The plant was to be built in West Memphis, Arkansas to provide an alternative to TVA as the power source for Memphis.  The construction of the Dixon-Yates plant was strongly supported by the federal government, including President Eisenhower.  Mayor Tobey traveled to Washington to testify before Congress in protest of the Dixon-Yates contract, and the measure was defeated.  While serving as mayor, Tobey earned a reputation for being an unusually kind, thoughtful and intelligent political leader.  Sadly, Tobey died suddenly of a heart attack in 1955, just two months before he was to run for re-election for mayor against Overton. -- The Frank Tobey Papers consists of material from Tobey’s three years of service as mayor of Memphis.  The collection can be divided into three basic groups: the growth of Memphis, race relations and municipal government.  The office files include information on the Board of Education, the police and fire departments, MLG&amp;W, consolidation, the Park Commission, city finances and Citizens for TVA, which opposed the Dixon-Yates contract.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Trezevant Family Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>John Timothy “J.T.” Trezevant was born in 1814 and came to Memphis when he was twenty one years old.  J.T. became a lawyer in 1836 and served as the second mayor of South Memphis in 1847.  He also achieved prominence as a railroad builder.  In 1852 he oversaw the construction of the Memphis &amp; Ohio rail line, which linked Memphis and Louisville. -- J.T. and his wife, Eleanor Louisa Beattie, had eight children.  Their fourth child, Mayre Beattie Trezevant, was born in Memphis in 1846.  He enlisted in the Confederate service in 1861 as a private and was quickly promoted to Lieutenant.  After the war he became a leading lawyer in Memphis.  He and his wife, Sue Simmons had several children: Nellie, Fannie, Roy, Hamilton, Mayre Brooks, who became a successful writer and cartoonist, Suzanne, who married E.H. Little, the president of the Palmolive Corporation and Stanley, who was a leading banker in Memphis. -- The Trezevant Family Papers provide information on several generations of Trezevants.  The collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1979 by Eleanor Trezevant McKinney and contains material from the years 1862 to 1930.  The papers include items such as letters, personal papers, newspaper clippings and numerous short stories by Mayre Brooks Trezevant.  Most of the correspondence relates to family matters such as illnesses, marriages and deaths.  The collection also includes two books of poetry and two scrapbooks which contain newspaper clippings on the Trezevant family and current events such as the Civil War, the Nat Turner insurrection, yellow fever, and the struggle to obtain voting rights for African Americans.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Ernest B. &quot;Tony&quot; Vaccaro Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Ernest B. “Tony” Vacarro Collection contains mementos reflecting a career of more than thirty years as a reporter for the Associated Press.  Photographs taken from Vaccaro’s scrapbook and from an album given to him when he retired as president of the National Press Club are the highlights of the collection.  Correspondence from various Washington figures, most notably President Harry S Truman, and newspaper articles by and about Vaccaro are included in the collection, as well as invitations to numerous receptions and parties hosted by major political figures of the time.  Finally, there are several speeches, as well as Vaccaro’s introductions of speakers at the National Press Club luncheons during his tenure as president of this prestigious organization. -- Born in Memphis in 1905, Tony Vaccaro attended Maury Elementary School.  He left Central High School, apparently without graduating, to take a job as a copy boy.  The following year he became a cub reporter for The Commercial Appeal, then moved to Nashville to work as a political reporter for the Associated Press.  He returned to Memphis as a correspondence in 1931, remaining here until 1938, when he was assigned to Washington. -- As a member of the Senate press corps, Vaccaro came to know Harry S Truman when he covered an investigative committee headed by the then-Senator.  The association served him well.  On Truman’s first trip to the White House after the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945, Truman offered Vaccaro a ride, which gave Vaccaro the opportunity to be the first person to interview the new president.  Vaccaro recorded the activities of six presidents; it was Truman, however, whom he knew as a friend and poker companion. -- While still comparatively new to his position in the Washington press corps, Vaccaro was chosen by his fellow reporters to head the White House Correspondents’ Association in 1948.  The following year he broke the “old school” tradition of the National Press Club by becoming a member of the Board of Governors, and in 1954 served as president.  During his tenure, outstanding national and world figures appeared as speakers at the club luncheons.  After his retirement, he was honored with election to the Hall of Fame of the professional journalism society, Sigma Delta Chi.  Vacarro retired in 1969 and returned to Memphis, where he remained until his death in 1979.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Roane Waring Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R7-R8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Roane Waring was born in 1881 in Memphis.  He graduated from Christian Brothers College and received a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1902.  Returning to Memphis to practice law, he represented the Memphis Street Railway in several lawsuits.  Through this early relationship, Waring established an association the Memphis Street Railway that resulted in him being named president of the company in 1934. -- Waring began a second career in the military with his enlistment in the Tennessee State Guard in 1903.  When America entered World War I, Governor Thomas Rye appointed Waring commanding officer of the 2nd Tennessee Infantry Regiment.  Waring fought in the Battle of St. Mihiel and the Muese-Argonne offensive and was promoted to Colonel and awarded the Silver Star for gallantry.  Because of his knowledge of the military, he was appointed as a special consultant to the war department and advised on issues related to soldiers returning to civilian life. -- After the war, Waring was active in organizing the veterans’ group that became the American Legion.  He served twice as state commander of the organization in Tennessee and during World War II was elected national commander.  In addition to his nationally recognized work with the American Legion, Waring’s civic involvement included two terms as president of the Memphis Chamber of Commerce, membership in Rotary and service on the Shelby County Election Board. -- Roane Waring headed the Memphis Street Railway Company for 24 years, retiring at the end of December 1957.  He died in Memphis in 1958 and was remembered as a man devoted to serving his city and country. -- The Roane Waring Collection consists of material related to his service as an attorney, American Legion member and president of the Memphis Street Railway Company.  The bulk of the material relates to the American Legion.  Also included are papers from his law firm, Waring, Walker, Cox &amp; Lewis and correspondence with Memphis political leader E.H. Crump, U.S. Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, and Tennessee governors Prentice Cooper and Frank Clement.  Finally, the collection contains many photographs of Waring touring military facilities, speaking at American Legion conventions and working at his desk.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Rabbi James A. Wax Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O1-O4, O13-O14</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>James Aaron Wax was born in 1912 in St. Louis.  Wax entered Washington University at St. Louis in 1930 and later transferred to Southeast Missouri State College, where he received a Bachelor’s degree in 1935.  Encouraged to enter the rabbinate by a Christian clergyman who recognized the young man’s gifts, Wax entered Hebrew Union college in Cincinnati, where he was awarded the Bachelor of Hebrew Letters in 1939 and the Master of Hebrew Letters in 1941. -- Following ordination, Rabbi Wax served congregations in Glencoe, Illinois and St. Louis.  While serving the congregation in Glencoe, he married Helen Louise Goldstrom in 1945, and they went on to have two sons, Jonathan Ira and James Aaron, Jr.  The Wax family moved to Memphis in 1946 when Rabbi Wax was called to be the Associate Rabbi of Temple Israel.  He served as co-Rabbi with Dr. Harry Ettelson until 1954, when Dr. Wax was given the position of Senior Rabbi, which he held until his retirement in 1978. -- In addition to his work as a member of the clergy, Rabbi Wax took an active role in civic and community leadership and served with many organizations, including The Tennessee State Board of Mental Health, the Memphis Ministers’ Association, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Democratic Party and the Urban League.  He also served as a teacher at the Memphis Theological Seminary and helped found the Christian Institute at Temple Israel to improve Jewish-Christian relations.  Rabbi Wax’s deep dedication to justice led him to take a courageous stand on civil rights in the turbulent period following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. -- The Rabbi James A. Wax Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Dr. Wax in 1987.  The extensive collection contains a wealth of information on Rabbi Wax’s involvement in a wide variety of community organizations such as the Tennessee State Board of Mental Health and the National Conference of Christians and Jews.

<dc:title>Brennan-Thomas Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Harry W. Brennan was born in Nashville in 1869. As a young man, his interest and ability in math led him to study engineering, and his first business venture was in the field of engineering and contracting. He moved to Memphis in 1904 with his sister Anna, and they joined their brother Joseph, who was working for the Commercial Appeal. Once in Memphis, Brennan discovered promising opportunities in real estate. With financial backing from his brother and other investors, Brennan developed a number of successful residential subdivisions, including Red Acres. He dedicated 120 acres from the land for Red Acres for construction of Galloway Park and Golf Course. -- Brennan provided leadership in many civic activities. For 15 years he actively promoted the Chamber of Commerce and published and edited the organization’s weekly journal Civic Affairs. An advocate of the state highway system, Brennan was appointed by Governor Malcolm Patterson to serve on the Tennessee Highway Commission. He also recognized the city’s importance in the national cotton market and supported the establishment of textile milling in Memphis. With his brother Joseph, he built and operated the ballroom and swimming pool in East End Park, which was a leading recreational facility for many years and the site of numerous annual festivals. -- James Albert Thomas, Jr., a native Memphian, was a realtor and served as Vice President of Boyle Investment Company for most of his business career. Later, he went into business with his son, James Albert Thomas, III, who organized Newsouth Capital Management. Thomas was an early resident of the Red Acres subdivision and took a leading role in forming the Red Acres Neighborhood Association. His interest in the history of Red Acres led him to research early deeds and land records of Shelby County. He was also concerned with zoning issues, crime prevention, University of Memphis expansion and Memphis Park Commission decisions that affected Galloway Golf Course. -- The Brennan—Thomas Collection incorporates two smaller collections related to these two individuals that each focus on the Red Acres Subdivision and Galloway Park. The papers span the years 1908 to 1993 and contain significant information on Chickasaw Gardens, including a historical account of the neighborhood written by James A. Thomas, Jr. Also in the collection is a directory of householders in Chickasaw Gardens covering the years 1926 to 1981. -- The collection includes audits and official documents associated with Brennan’s many real estate developments. The material also contains information on early Memphis subdivisions including Hyde Park, Belmont Park and Richland Place, which were developed by the Brennan Real Estate Company. A scrapbook compiled by Brennan includes newspaper clippings which describe his leadership roles in business, civic and government activities. The material related to James A. Thomas includes minutes of meetings of the Red Acres Neighborhood Association, correspondence, and zoning and planning studies. The Brennan—Thomas Collection provides a unique history of Galloway Park and Red Acres from their initial development on the outskirts of the city to their present-day position as a residential oasis in the heart of a major urban area.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Business Papers of Samuel B. Williamson, Napolean Hill and Noland Fontaine</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The firm of S.B. Williamson and A.S. Hancock, Grocers and Commission Merchants, was established at 49 Front in Memphis around 1850.  Like similar businesses of their day, they sold a variety of items including groceries and farm supplies, and also served as cotton factors – plantation owners would often pay for their purchases with cotton. -- In 1856, Hancock sold his interest in the business to his partner.  By early 1862, Noland Fontaine was working for Williamson, and in 1863 the business changed its name to Williamson and Hill.  Williamson, Hancock and Fontaine were each periodically involved in the business and over the years the firm had several different names reflecting the involvement of the partners.  In 1875 a change in the current of the Mississippi River caused the building which housed the company’s cotton to fall into the river.  However, the business continued to exist for another quarter of a century.  After this time, the partners seem to have been occupied with their other pursuits, and the company went into liquidation. -- S.B. Williamson was involved in a number of business activities in addition to the business on Front.  He was an investor in the Bank of West Tennessee at Memphis, the Hernando Insurance Company and the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Co.  In addition, he owned several lots on Union, Madison and Main Streets in Memphis, as well as land in several counties in Mississippi and Arkansas.  Williamson married Mary E. Eanes in 1845, and served as an alderman of Memphis from 1848 to 1849. -- Noland Fontaine married Jennie W. Eanes in 1864.  He served as a member of the Memphis School Board in 1873 and also served as a director of several banks and as president of the Factors Insurance Company.  He is best remembered as the owner of the Woodruff-Fontaine House, which he purchased from Amos Woodruff and which is located in the Victorian Village neighborhood. -- Napoleon Hill was born in Maury County, Tennessee and grew up in Marshall County, Mississippi.  As a teenager, he worked in a dry goods store, and then joined the California gold rush.  He did not find success as a gold miner, but spent several years operating a trading post for other miners.  Returning to Tennessee, he married his childhood sweetheart, Mary Woods, and established a grocery business in Memphis with Charles Dorian.  Hill was a founder of the Union and Planters Bank and served as its president.  He also served as one of the first directors of the Cossitt Library, and was instrumental in soliciting book donations for the library.  An investor in railroads, coal mines and insurance companies, he also owned a major cotton warehousing business and served as president of the Memphis Cotton Exchange. -- The business papers of Williamson, Hill and Fontaine were originally donated to the Cossitt Library, but were transferred to the Memphis and Shelby County Room when its manuscript collection was established.  The papers, which include promissory notes, correspondence and documents related to bankruptcies, real estate transactions and the sale of slaves, reveal important information about business practices during the period.  Promissory notes were used almost as currency and were passed from business to business.  Bankruptcies were frequent occurrences during the post-Civil War period and the buying and selling of real estate was a major business activity.  The papers also show the rise in the price of slaves over time and the important role of the Mississippi River and cotton in the economy of the Mid South.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Marshall Wingfield Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K21</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Revered Marshall Wingfield was a distinguished minister, historian, author, poet and a passionate activist for peace and justice.  He was the senior minister of the First Congregational Church in Memphis from 1937 to 1958 and served as president of the West Tennessee Historical Society from 1938 to 1961.  During his long and productive career, he wrote numerous books and articles on religion and history. -- Wingfield was born in 1893 on his father’s tobacco plantation in Franklin County, Virginia.  Although his father wanted him to be a doctor, Wingfield realized early that he wanted to be a preacher, and as a child would gather other children around him as he stood behind an ash-hopper to “preach.”  As a young man, Wingfield sustained a serious injury that crushed bones in his neck, and he spent three years confined to his bed in a cast.  During the long recovery period, he was tutored rigorously by a neighborhood physician.  This superior education allowed Wingfield to enter college several years early.  He received a Bachelor’s degree from Texas Christian University in Forth Worth and a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary in New York. -- In 1912 Wingfield was ordained to the ministry of the Disciples of Christ Church in Virginia.  As a young minister, Wingfield lectured extensively on religious and racial tolerance and many of his lectures were featured in local newspapers.  After serving as a minister in Virginia, Wingfield spent several years at the First Christian Church in Amory, Mississippi.  While there, his volume of sermons, Forces of Destiny, as well as a collection of poetry, Translating Christmas and Other Poems, was published. -- Shortly after arriving in Memphis in 1937, Wingfield was asked to conduct a weekly book review program on radio station WMC.  In 1945 he was asked to host a weekly religious news broadcast on WMPS that continued for the next twelve years. -- In 1944 Wingfield organized the Memphis Round Table of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.  His continuing commitment to justice inspired him to write a powerful sermon, “The Implications of the Atomic Bomb,” which he delivered in August 1945 at First United Methodist Church in Memphis, while his wife, Marie Gregson Wingfield, also a minister, read the same sermon to the members of First Congregational Church.  The sermon, in which Wingfield stated that “man has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge before eating of the Tree of Life,” and [his] mentality has run too far ahead of his spirituality,” appeared in the Congressional Record in December 1945.  Wingfield was recognized for his work on behalf of peace and justice with a testimonial dinner given in his honor by the Sertoma Club in February 1952, as well as the establishment of a human relations scholarship in his name at Memphis State University. -- The Marshall Wingfield Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Reverend Wingfield and additional material was later given by his wife, the Reverend Marie Gregson Wingfield.  The collection includes photographs, articles, poetry, book reviews, letters, newspaper clippings and lectures reflecting Wingfield’s deep and varied interests in travel, history and social justice.  Also included is a nineteen-page bibliography of his works, an entry on Reverend Wingfield from Who’s Who in America, and programs from the 1952 Sertoma Testimonial Service for Dr. Wingfield at the Peabody Hotel.</dc:description>

<dc:title>George Sparks Little Theatre Wartime Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J12</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>George F. Sparks came to Memphis in 1943 to serve as director of the Memphis Little Theatre, replacing Fred Sears, who had joined the army.  Sparks, a thirty-one year old from Emporia, Kansas, had experience in both acting and directing. -- Sparks received his undergraduate degree with a major in speech from Kansas State Teachers College at Emporia.  He received his master’s degree in speech and theater at Northwestern in Chicago in 1941, and went on to direct productions at the high school and college levels, and acted in some productions himself.  In addition, he served a year in the armed forces before receiving a medical discharge. -- During his tenure with the Memphis Little Theatre, Sparks directed and designed the sets for such plays as You Can’t Take It With You, Love From a Stranger, The Philadelphia Story, and The Torch Bearer.  Even though he faced the wartime problems of lack of transportation and a shortage of staff, his productions were acclaimed for being highly entertaining. -- The George Sparks Little Theatre Wartime Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mr. Sparks in 1977.  Included in the collection are photographs and stage drawings from a number of productions presented during Sparks’ tenure as director of Memphis Little Theatre, as well as programs from the plays and newspaper clippings about the theatre, its personnel and the productions.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Witzmann-Gamble Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R32-R34</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Emile Frederick Augustus Witzmann was born in Germany in 1841 but lived his young adult years in Paris.  He spoke seven languages and was known throughout his life as a voracious reader of books, enjoying reading them in their natural languages.  After graduating from school in Paris, Emile moved to Madrid, where he taught modern languages and music.  After Madrid, Witzmann moved to England where he taught students from the Mid-South.  In 1866, Emile Witzmann moved to Memphis where he got a job teaching music and languages.  It was in 1872 that Emile founded E. Witzmann and Company, a music store based in Memphis that sold pianos, organs, and other musical instruments as well as sheet music for various instruments. -- Following Emile Witzmann’s death in 1914, Witzmann and Co. continued to be run by his wife Suzie and his son-in-law Fred O. Gamble.  Fred Gamble traveled the country selling pianos before he became vice president of Witzmann and Co. music store.  It was during his time traveling that he began to court and eventually marry Mary Louis Witzmann, Emile’s daughter.  While traveling the country, Fred kept in touch with Mary Louis by writing hundreds of letters to her, sometimes more than twice daily.  Their courtship right up through marriage is documented in these hundreds of letters.  It is this correspondence between Fred Gamble and Mary Louis that make up the bulk of this collection.  Frederick Gamble, Jr. donated the collection to the library in 1983.  Besides correspondence between Fred O. Gamble, Sr. and his wife Mary Louis, the collection includes the following: diaries, business cards, newspaper clippings, bills and band statements from Witzmann and Co., photographs, and telegrams.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Jerry O. Potter Sultana Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K29-K30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Sultana left Memphis on April 27, 1865 carrying three times the number of passengers for which it was designed.  Tragedy struck later that evening when the boilers ruptured, causing the steamer to explode.  Many were killed immediately from the blast, but others were crushed or died from burns, hypothermia and drowning.  Sadly, most of the victims were former prisoners of war who had been interned at the notorious Andersonville and Cahaba Prisons for captured Federal soldiers during the Civil War. -- The sinking occurred just after the surrender of the Confederacy, the assassination of President Lincoln and the death of John Wilkes Booth, and was largely forgotten until the 1992 publication of Jerry O. Potter’s The Sultana Tragedy: America’s Greatest Maritime Disaster. -- Potter, a Memphis lawyer, became interested in the sinking of the Sultana after seeing a painting of the event in a local bank.  Initial research into the destruction of the steamer revealed very little.  Newspaper articles found from 1865 conveyed the enormity of the disaster, but the few modern books written about the event did little to detail the extensive loss of life.  Potter decided to uncover the facts behind the ill-fated Sultana and her 2,300 passengers and bring their story to light.  After a decade of extensive research, he published his book, which became one the most respected works on the subject. -- Potter, a native Tennessean who grew up in Milan, earned a degree in history from the University of Tennessee at Martin.  While a student, he won the Tennessee Historical Commission Award for earning the highest marks in history, and was awarded an internship by the Tennessee Valley Authority to conduct historical research on the state.  From this research, Potter published a study entitled “Problems relating to the Socio-Economical Development of Northwest Tennessee 1819 through 1900.”  Potter went on to earn a law degree from Memphis State University in 1975 and became a partner in The Hardison Law Firm in Memphis. -- Potter donated the research materials from his book to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 2005.  The collection consists of photocopied documents and correspondence used to write the manuscript, as well as numerous photographs.  Included are documents pertaining to the court martial of Frederic Speed, the only person brought to trial following the Sultana disaster.  In addition, the papers contain the proceedings of the Washburn and Dana Commissions’ investigations into the loss of the Sultana.  Also included are various items such as unit rosters, published articles, correspondence and other pieces of information gathered by Potter over time.  Some material that was not included in Potter’s book, such as genealogical information, photographs and information received through correspondence with other researchers is also contained in the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Paul Coppock Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O8-O10, O16-O21</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Paul Coppock was born in Greenfield, Indiana, and during his youth lived in Virginia, New York, Nebraska, and Illinois. He attended Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, and planned to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a history teacher. Instead, he became a journalist. His first full-time job was with the Indiana Post. After this newspaper folded, Coppock moved to Memphis and worked a year with the Memphis Press-Scimitar. In 1929, he became a cub reporter for The Commercial Appeal, reporting on Memphis and Shelby County government. -- In the early 1940s, Coppock was promoted to night city editor. While holding this position, Coppock originated “The Night Desk,” a question-and-answer column about the history of the Mid-South. The column, which first appeared in 1946, continued for 21 years. In 1972, Coppock retired from The Commercial Appeal, but continued to write a weekly article entitled “Mid-South Memoirs.” This human interest column, also centered on local history, ran until 1982. Coppock’s writings were compiled into a book called Memphis Sketches and a three volume set of books entitled Memphis Memoirs. Coppock was greatly admired by the people of the Mid-South, and his writings were a consistent source of insight into Memphis history, people and events. -- Paul Coppock’s papers were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1992 by his wife, Helen McPheron Coppock. The collection consists primarily of material from Coppock’s career as a journalist, including numerous notes, photos, booklets, brochures and a photocopied edition and original manuscripts for his book, Memphis Sketches. The Coppock collection also includes 21 scrapbooks which contain a complete series of “The Night Desk” columns. The extensive collection provides information on the subjects of Coppock’s numerous columns related to Memphis and the Mid-South, including annexation, Beale Street, cemeteries, the Mid-South Fair, hospitals and biographical information on many Mid-Southerners, such as E.H. Crump and the Church family. A comprehensive index to Coppock’s columns and other materials he collected can be referenced in the finding aid to the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Beale Street Development Corporation Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B6</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Beale Street Development Corporation Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 2005 by Thane Wheeler.  Spanning the years 1972 to 1985, the collection contains correspondence, government reports, land records, legal documents, and newspaper articles related to the operation of the Beale Street Development Corporation during the formative years of its existence. -- In 1973, the not-for-profit Beale Street Development Corporation was formed to assist entrepreneurs wanting to open businesses on the famous thoroughfare.  At that point many of the historic buildings on Beale Street had been destroyed owing to a federal urban renewal project and the City of Memphis hoped to secure additional federal funds to rebuild the street into an entertainment district.  As a result, in 1978 city government awarded the Beale Street Development Corporation a $2 million restoration grant, and in 1982 the BSDC signed a 32-year lease with the city to co-develop and manage the property with Elkington &amp; Keltner Properties, Inc.  Although plagued by controversy, the Beale Street Development Corporation helped save a national historic landmark and oversaw its transformation into one of Memphis’ most popular tourist destinations.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Everett R. Cook Oral History Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G22-G28, G32-G35</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Oral History Program began in the early 1960s when former Tennessee Governor W. Browning agreed to be interviewed on audio tape by Memphis State University professor and archivist Joseph H. Riggs. This interview was very successful, and the program was expanded to include taped interviews with people from Memphis and Tennessee including Abe Plough, Blair Hunt and George W. Lee. The program also includes tapes of conversations with individuals associated with events such as the funerals of Martin Luther King, Jr., and William Faulkner and interviews conducted through the Neighborhood History Project about Memphis neighborhoods including Cooper-Young, Greenlaw, Buntyn-Messick and Vollentine-Evergreen. Interviews were also conducted on race relations, the Memphis mayoral campaign of 1967, the school lunch program, the Tennessee Poetry Society and the Memphis Blues Project. Also included are interviews with individuals who were instrumental in the history of music in Memphis which were conducted by Margaret McKee and Fred Chisenhall for their book, Beale Black and Blue. -- The Oral History Program tapes also include the memoirs of General Everett R. Cook, who had a successful career as a businessman and a military officer. As a businessman, Cook owned his own cotton company and formed E. R. Cook &amp; Co., which was later known as Cook Industries, Inc. During World War I, Cook served in the 91st Aero Squadron, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He served as a lieutenant colonel during World War II, and served as deputy chief of staff under General Carl Spaatz in the U.S. Air Force. He achieved the rank of brigadier general in 1948. -- General Cook was also a dedicated civil servant. In 1953 he was elected to the Tennessee Constitutional Convention, and he served as chair of the Auditorium Commission and as a director of Eastern Airlines and Plough, Inc. The Everett R. Cook Convention Center was named in his honor in 1974, and he was awarded honorary degrees from Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College) and Christian Brothers College. -- Cook’s memoirs were installed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1972. Transcripts of the tapes were adapted into a hardbound book, Everett R. Cook: A Memoir, and General Cook contributed 1,000 copies to be sold to benefit the Oral History Program.</dc:description>

<dc:title>National Coalition of 100 Black Women Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N5</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The 100 Black Women’s Club began in New York City as a grassroots effort to address social issues and affect change within the community.  Over time, the club reached out to other black women in order to mobilize themselves into a visible and influential force.  In 1971, this regional community officially organized as the Coalition of 100 Black Women. -- By its 10-year anniversary, the organization had amassed approximately 900 members from within the New York metropolitan area.  Due to its effective role modeling structure and programs, black women outside of New York wished to duplicate the Coalition’s work throughout the country.  The Coalition, under the direction of President Jewell Jackson McCabe, relaunched in October 1981 with chapters in 14 states and the word ‘National’ in its name.  By 1986, the NCOBW boasted of 47 chapters in 19 states and national membership of over three thousand. -- The original spirit of the Coalition remains the same today.  With more than 7,000 members in 25 states, it remains dedicated to rebuilding black communities and providing resources for at-risk black women. -- Founded on October 24, 1981, the Memphis Chapter works to empower and inform the black women of the Memphis area by holding several conventions and programs throughout the year on topics ranging from financial planning to HIV/AIDS awareness. -- The collection contains articles concerning the Memphis Chapter’s community involvement, membership lists, and information regarding the various programs and charity events.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Josephine Wainman Burson Collection: A Life in Public Service</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K28</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Josephine Wainman Burson, community leader and social activist, was dedicated to significantly improving the quality of life for women, underserved individuals and minority populations. Her career focused on community service and political activism, especially by serving with women’s groups, where she utilized her organizational skills to provide employment and educational opportunities and break down barriers. She served in a variety of organizations, including local Democratic women’s clubs and Hadassah, the largest Jewish women’s organization in the United States. -- Burson was born in 1915 and attended local schools and Memphis State College. In 1937 she married Leo Burson, a young law student at St. Lawrence University in New York. Leo Burson, who went on to become a well-known Memphis attorney and businessman, received many honors and shared his wife’s passion for political activism. The Burson’s two children, Linda Burson, a physician, and Charles W. Burson, who served as Tennessee Attorney General from 1988 until 1996, were greatly influenced by their parent’s activism and commitment to social justice. -- Josephine Burson attributed much of her public success to the skills she acquired through her work with Hadassah. A highlight of Burson’s exceptional efforts to improve the quality of life for others was her serving as Commissioner of Employment Security for the state of Tennessee. Appointed to this position by Governor Buford Ellington in 1967, Burson was the first woman and the first Jewish person to be appointed to the cabinet of a Tennessee governor. She was one of only three women in the United States to hold such a position at that time. -- Following her term in state government, Burson spent 20 years with Memphis Senior Services, where she served as vice-president for communications. At the time of her retirement, Burson had spent more than 50 years helping to expand opportunities for women and improving the quality of life in the communities she served. -- The Josephine Wainman Burson Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mrs. Burson in 1999. The material in the collection dates from 1967 to 1970 when she served as Commissioner of Employment Security. The papers consist of correspondence, government documents, publications, newspaper clippings and news releases. -- Materials relating to Burson’s role in state government include documents on the education and training activities of the Department of Employment Security. Also included are Department of Employment Security papers regarding labor matters such as benefits or employment requests, as well as materials that pertain specifically to services for women, youth and individuals with special needs. -- In addition to professional documents, the collection includes correspondence relating to Burson’s wide-ranging activities in Hadassah and other local and national Jewish organizations, which took her across the United States, to Europe, and to Israel. Also included are personal letters and speeches she made to a variety of organizations. -- The collection provides information on the role of a woman involved in diverse and important fields of activity at a time when women were beginning to assume leadership and administrative roles previously available only to men.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Register of the Henry A. Montgomery Family</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R1-R2</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Henry A. Montgomery was born in Fermanagh County, Ireland in 1829.  At fifteen he began an apprenticeship with Thos. Karnahan &amp; Sons, a timber, slate and iron dealership.  He immigrated to Canada in the spring of 1848 and moved later that year to Brown County, Ohio.  By the time Montgomery applied for U.S. citizenship in 1851, he had married Maria Jane Dugan, a native of Ohio.  The young family moved to Tennessee shortly after the birth of their daughter Julia, the first of Henry and Maria’s six children.  The Montgomerys lived a short time in Somerville before settling in Memphis, where Henry became involved in the telegraph business. -- His early efforts involved direct control of all phases of the introduction of telegraphic communications into the Memphis area, but by the late 1850s, Montgomery was dealing primarily with the construction of telegraph lines.  Through his efforts, Memphis became a junction for Morse communication.  Unfortunately, the pressure of larger companies and the effects of the Federal occupation of Memphis during the Civil War forced Montgomery out of the telegraph business.  He sold his interests to the Southwestern Telegraph Company, which later merged with other regional companies to form Western Union. -- After leaving the telegraph business, Montgomery explored other ventures, including lumber, dry goods and cotton speculation.  His achievements in business brought prosperity and social recognition to Montgomery and his family.  By the mid-1860s, the Montgomerys had become a part of the social elite in Memphis had and earned a reputation for being hospitable and concerned about community affairs. -- After Maria’s death in 1870, Montgomery continued to be active in the civic and business affairs of the city.  He was elected Fire and Police Commissioner in 1884 and served as president of the Memphis Jockey Club.  He was also the principal promoter and financial investor in the Montgomery Park race track.  It was while serving in his role as business and community leader that Henry A. Montgomery died dramatically on October 20, 1887.  Immediately after welcoming delegates of the Waterways Convention to Memphis and to the Montgomery Park races, he fell dead on the speakers’ platform.  After his death, Montgomery’s children continued the family tradition of involvement in civic affairs and served in local organizations such as the Nineteenth Century Club, the Tennessee Club and the Memphis Jockey Club. -- The identity of the donor of the Montgomery family collection is unknown.  The papers, which span the years 1853 to 1942, contain materials which reflect the social history and personal relationships of the Montgomery family.  Also included are business papers relating to Henry’s experiences in the telegraph business and documents which list Memphis businesses and costs of living in the second half of the nineteenth century in this area. -- The collection includes papers about Henry’s granddaughter, Montgomery Cooper, which detail her attempts to establish herself as a rare book dealer and include her correspondence as Literary Editor of The Commercial Appeal in the 1920s.  In addition, the papers include materials related to Henry’s daughter, Jennie Montgomery Jones, which were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room as a separate gift.  The majority of these items are legal documents concerning property, business papers from the family’s cotton business, and bills and receipts from the 1870s and 1880s for living expenses from the family’s mansion, Montgomery Place.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Robert L. Waller Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Dr. Robert Lee Waller was born in 1924 in Memphis.  After graduating from Booker T. Washington High School in 1942, he entered the United States Navy, where he served until the end of World War II.  After leaving the navy, he enrolled in Howard University and graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  He received Master of Arts degrees from Howard University and Memphis State University, and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Education from Western Colorado University.  In addition, he was twice granted a Fulbright Fellowship to study in Brazil, Liberia and Nigeria.  He was also an NDEA Fellow in American history at the University of Chicago. -- Dr. Waller spent more than twenty-five years as a teacher and administrator in the Memphis public schools.  After his retirement, he accepted a position as Associate Professor of history at LeMoyne-Owen College and served in this position for eight years.  He was also named Director of the Interdisciplinary Center for African and African American studies at LeMoyne-Owen.  Two days before his death in 1990, Dr. Waller was appointed Professor Emeritus of African American Studies. -- During his career as a teacher in Memphis, Robert Waller was a familiar figure in the Memphis Public Library.  After his death, his sister, Viola Waller Amos, donated his professional papers to the Memphis and Shelby County Room.  Material found in The Robert L. Waller Collection traces the career of Dr. Waller from the time he left the navy after World War II until his death.  In addition to correspondence dating from 1946 through 1981, there are academic papers submitted for classes at several institutions or published in various journals.  The collection also includes diplomas, certificates and plaques recognizing Waller’s achievements and photographs of Waller.  Finally, there are obituaries and tributes paid to him after his death in 1990.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Dr. R.Q. and Ethyl H. Venson Cotton Makers' Jubilee Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B27</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Dr. Ransom Q. Venson was a native of Rapides Parish, Louisiana.  In 1912 he graduated from Meharry Medical School in Nashville and then moved to Memphis to establish a dental practice in this city.  In 1934, he married Ethyl B. Horton, a native Memphian, who was born in 1908.  Ethyl grew up in the area near Collins Chapel and went on to earn a degree from LeMoyne College.  Throughout their marriage, Ransom and Ethyl were committed to serving their community in a variety of ways. -- During World War I, Dr. Venson served as a commissioned officer in the Medical Corps.  After returning to his dental practice in Memphis after the war, he was a leader in the founding of Autress Russell American Legion Post 27, which was for many years the largest African-American post in the world.  He held every office in the local American Legion organization and was also active on the national level.  Dr. Venson was also an active Mason and a member of the Elks.  He  was honored for his service to the community in 1972 by having a high-rise housing development for senior citizens on Beale Street named after him. -- Ethyl Venson was the first woman and the first African American to be appointed to the board of the Memphis Housing Authority in 1966, and she went on to be elected as chair of the board in 1972.  Also in 1972, Governor Winfield Dunn appointed her to the Tennessee Commission on the Status of Women.  Ethyl also devoted her time to serving with the American Red Cross, the Memphis Urban League, the Memphis Heart Association and the Girls Club. -- The Vensons are perhaps best-known as founders of the Cotton Makers’ Jubilee, which was established in 1935 as a parallel organization to the Memphis Cotton Carnival, which had been established in 1931 but did not provide for social participation by African American Memphians.  Dr. Venson served as director of the Jubilee until his death in 1970, while Ethyl served as the organization’s first queen in 1935, and served as director from 1970 to 1985. -- Through the many activities of the Cotton Makers’ Jubilee, particularly the selection of a King and Queen and a royal Court, the organization provided an opportunity for African Americans in Memphis to enjoy their own parties, parades and celebrations.  Over the years, the Jubilee continually expanded its activities, including many for school children. -- The Dr. R.Q. and Ethyl H. Venson Cotton Makers’ Jubilee Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Ethyl Horton Venson through the Shelby County Historical Commission and additional material was given directly to the Memphis and Shelby County Room.  The collection includes thirty six Cotton Makers’ Jubilee programs from 1937 through 1991, which list the Jubilee royalty, the directors, financial supporters and others associated with the organization in various capacities.  The collection also contains correspondence about the Jubilee which Ethyl Venson received from local and national officials, including several Tennessee governors and two U.S. presidents.  In addition to material related to the Jubilee, the papers contain letters from civic and business leaders pertaining to Ethyl Venson’s many years of service to several community organizations, including the Memphis Housing Authority, the Bluff City Dental Society, the American Red Cross, the Memphis Urban League and the Memphis/Shelby County Mental Health Association.</dc:description>

<dc:title>W.W. Busby's Letters</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R31</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>W. W. Busby was born in 1893 and spent his early years in the Memphis neighborhoods known as Meacham’s Shinertown and Pinch. His father, John Busby, owned several markets in Memphis before the family moved to Texas in 1904. W.W. Busby attended Market Street School and St. Mary’s Catholic School. He graduated from Chamberlain-Hunt Academy in 1912, and attended The University of Mississippi. His versatile career included stints as a railroad man in Chicago, a hotel man in Arkansas, a sailor, and a Mississippi cotton farmer. At the time Busby wrote the letters in this collection, he had retired except for working occasionally as an accountant in Eudora, Mississippi. -- The collection of letters written by W.W. Busby was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Paul Coppock, longtime Night City Editor of The Commercial Appeal. Busby and Coppock began corresponding after Coppock requested information about the Creeping Bear murder, which was believed to be the last killing in Memphis of a white man by a Native American. The two men developed a unique relationship in which they wrote about many different aspects of life in Memphis around the turn of the century. Coppock donated these letters so that researchers might gain insight into Memphis during this time in history.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Britton Duke Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Britton Duke Papers are a chronicle of an early Germantown, Tennessee, family. The papers were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Louise Duke Bedford, great granddaughter of Britton Duke, and her nephew, Edward C. Duke. The collection primarily consists of correspondence and business papers which belonged to Britton Duke. Duke, a prominent cotton planter and civic leader, owned property in Shelby County which was adjacent to the Nashoba Plantation, a utopian community founded by Frances Wright. The Duke property, which ran from Massey Road in East Memphis to Poplar Estates and from U.S. Highway 72 to the Wolf River, joined Nashoba on the east. -- Britton Duke immigrated from Scotland Neck, North Carolina, to Shelby County in 1830. He was accompanied by his second wife, Mary Louise Duke. On their way to Pea Ridge (sometimes called Pea Mount and now a part of Germantown) the Dukes delayed their trip at LaGrange, Tennessee, where their first daughter was born. Once he arrived in Shelby County, Duke immediately established himself as a leading citizen of the area, where he often acted as an agent or witness for his less wealthy and illiterate neighbors. -- Britton and Mary Louise Duke had seven children. Britton was very interested in the education of his own family and served as a long-time school commissioner for the 11th district of Shelby County. The papers include correspondence relating to his role as school commissioner, school schedules and receipts for the Duke children’s tuition and school supplies. -- The collection, which was previously called The Duke-Bedford Family Papers, serves as a valuable resource on the Nashoba Plantation and Frances Wright. The collection includes a receipt written to Duke for $20 for timber cut from Nashoba, an 1854 newspaper advertisement for Nashoba and correspondence regarding the Nashoba land. In addition to numerous receipts for farming equipment and household supplies, the collection provides important information on slavery, including bills of sale for slaves which list the slaves by name.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Martha Hamilton Embree Courtroom Art Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>MC</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In 1994, Martha Hamilton “Ham” Embree, noted Memphis artist, donated a large collection of watercolor courtroom drawings she was commissioned to do by local television stations to the Memphis and Shelby County Room. A pioneer in television animation, Embree was the courtroom artist for CBS News and its Memphis affiliate, WREG-TV, Channel 3. Embree’s drawings gave visual reality to trials that could be covered by courtroom reporters but not photographers. -- The collection includes images from important trials from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Drawings from trials such as the James Earl Ray evidentiary hearings, the Judge David Lanier trial, the Deborah Groseclose murder trial, the Congressman Harold Ford case and the Dr. George Nichopolous trial are significant from both a legal and historical standpoint. The Ray hearings, related to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Nichopolous case, with its sensational testimony related to Elvis Presley’s drug dependence, involved world-famous individuals. -- Embree was born in Como, Mississippi. After graduating from Mississippi State College for Women in 1943, she moved to Memphis and enrolled at the Memphis Academy of Art, where she received a certificate in commercial art in 1944. She and her husband, Edward Embree, were a part of the city’s “art group” that included well-known artists such as Dolph Smith, Nancy Bogatin, Mimi Dann, Billy Price Hosmer and Carroll Cloar. -- From 1954 to 1976, Embree managed the Studio of Advertising and Art with Nancy Bogatin. In 1977 the agency merged with Jan Gardner &amp; Associates, a firm headed by Jan Gardner and Margaret Lowery. Embree assumed the position of senior vice-president and creative director in the new organization, which handled some 31 local, regional and national accounts. -- A large body of Embree’s watercolors depicting the rural South appeared in the Ford Times. Her work was also published in national magazines such as Psychology Today, Ebony and Mademoiselle. One of her best-known pieces of art was the Les Passes’ 1979 New Year’s Eve cabaret program cover, a montage that featured many of the area’s best known music personalities including W.C. Handy, Elvis Presley, Bessie Smith and Marguerite Piazza. -- Exhibits of Embree’s regional art were held in several Mid-South towns and included studies in oil, egg tempera, acrylic and opaque watercolor. Her childhood in the Mississippi Delta was reflected in her Southern themes, and she and her husband Ed traveled throughout the South searching for subjects to capture with their art. Embree was a talented portrait painter, and one of her most significant pieces was a study of Edwin Hubbard, the late jazz flutist. Her portrait work also included studies of Native Americans, children and ordinary people of the rural South. -- After Embree’s death in 1996, her friends organized an estate sale of art pieces in her home. A selection of this work was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room prior to the estate sale. These pieces include oils, watercolors, egg tempera, crayon, charcoal and pencil studies. Stored with the courtroom drawings, these additional pieces demonstrate Embree’s substantial talent.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis - Enschede Ties</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N1</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Prior to World War II, Enschede, the largest cotton manufacturing city in the Netherlands, and Memphis, the Mid-South’s cotton-exchange center, maintained firm business ties.  Enschede, situated six miles from the German border, was completely devastated during the war.  With its cotton mills destroyed and many of its citizens left destitute, it needed outside assistance to recover. -- During a transatlantic telephone call in early 1946, the mayor of Enschede, John van Hatem, suggested to Memphis Mayor Walter Chandler that Memphis adopt Enschede to help the city recover from the war.  This call was followed by a visit to Enschede by Francis Hickman, editor of the Memphis Cotton Trade Journal, who was touring Germany at the end of the war at the request of General Eisenhower. -- Although Mayor Chandler doubted that Memphis had the resources to adopt another city, he assigned the relief effort to the Memphis International Center.  The hard work of W.R. Herstein, Executive Director of the Memphis International Center, made the campaign a success.  3,000 friendship boxes were prepared and sent by the children of Memphis to the children of Enschede, followed by shipments of clothing and 10,000 tins of canned food.  These efforts led to the creation of a strong bond between the two cities. -- Memphis and Enschede continued to maintain close ties after the war relief effort through numerous visits by citizens of each city to their sister city.  The strength of this connection was clearly demonstrated in 1953, when the most devastating flood since 1421 swept over the Netherlands.  Although Enschede was not directly affected, the Memphis Flood Relief Committee began collecting money for victims of the flood.  By mentioning that the funds collected would be transmitted directly to the Mayor of Enschede, who would then channel them to the proper Dutch authorities, the organization collected a total of $14,526.09.  A comparison of this figure with the grand total of approximately $16,000 collected in the whole state of Tennessee clearly demonstrates the strong bond of friendship that had developed between the Memphis and Enschede. -- The Memphis – Enschede Ties collection contains correspondence relating to the adoption of Enschede by the people of Memphis, including letters exchanged between the mayors of the two cities.  The papers provide details about the gifts made to the people of Enschede after the war such as lists of items and amounts of monetary gifts shipped to the city.  The collection also includes numerous newspaper clippings on the relationship between Memphis and Enschede and letters relating to flood relief efforts undertaken by the people of Memphis in 1953. -- In 1957, Ethel Schroeder, Vice-President of the International Advisory Council, Inc. wrote to Frank Ahlgren, editor of the Commercial Appeal, requesting information on the ties between Memphis and Enschede.  Schroeder felt that the connection between the two cities was a good example of the type of relationship President Eisenhower was trying to promote through his People-to-People program.  Letters exchanged between Schroeder and Ahlgren are included in the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Evergreen Historic District Association Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G8, G16-G21</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Evergreen Historic District Association is the current name of a civic organization started in 1969, but the first Evergreen association began in 1909 as the Woman’s Evergreen Improvement Club.  The boundaries of the community have changed somewhat over the years, but basically Evergreen includes the area due west of Overton Park, the north-south dimensions corresponding to those of the park.  In the early decades of the 1900s, the Evergreen neighborhood was a very fashionable suburban neighborhood, with comfortable family homes sitting next to elaborate mansions.  During and after the war, many homes turned into rooming houses and there was an exodus to the newer suburbs to the east.  In the 1960s and 1970s, Evergreen residents (as part of the Mid-Memphis Improvement Association, along with other interested parties) successfully fought against the intrusion of the I-40 expressway, though not before the demolition of a 56-acre swath of homes to make room for “The Corridor.”  By 1985, the Mid-Memphis Neighborhood Association had succeeded in having Evergreen declared a National Register Historic District.  Realizing their name should reflect that status, the group made a final change to the Evergreen Historic District Association (EHDA).  The Corridor was successfully redeveloped during the 1990s, with noteworthy adherence to redevelopment guidelines which maintained the architectural and stylistic integrity of the neighborhood.  The Evergreen Historic District Association Collection contains materials from the latter half of the 20th century and the first few years of the 21st.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Farrow Family Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Kathryn Farrow was born in 1883 to Catherine Gooch and George Ferdinand Farrow. She was a schoolteacher for many years, and her father was a civic leader who helped to organize a public school system in Whitehaven. -- George Farrow’s father, Lemuel Farrow, came to the Whitehaven area around 1848 with his wife Sophia and their children. Lemuel and his sons, George and James Marion, were landowners and cotton planters. -- The Farrow Family Papers consist primarily of correspondence exchanged between members of George Farrow’s family. Most of the letters relate to routine matters of health, weather conditions and social activities. The papers include a series of letters between Catherine Gooch Farrow and her daughter, Kathryn, who lived in various places in Tennessee and Virginia while completing her education. Kathryn returned to Whitehaven, then known as White Haven, around 1914 to become a teacher of history at White Haven High School. Both Kathryn and her mother were interested in tracing the Gooch family history, and the collection contains correspondence and other papers related to their genealogy research. -- The collection also includes documents accumulated by George Farrow during the course of his service as a member of the school board and several items related to Kathryn Farrow’s career as a teacher. These papers provide detailed information about the development of the public school system in the area. Receipts and statements of accounts related to the Farrow family’s cotton business are also included in the collection. In addition, the collection contains several contracts with farm workers. These items give details on the price and weight of the Farrow’s cotton as well as identifying the workers responsible for picking and processing the cotton. Finally, the papers include more than 100 receipts for various purchases typical of a large family. Most of the receipts are for the purchases of staple goods, many of which were bought from the same companies that handled the family’s cotton.</dc:description>

<dc:title>William Teasley Berlin Family Letters Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S30 (Part of Yellow Fever)</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>This small collection of letters was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1985 by Dexter Muller. The letters in the collection provide a great deal of information about the life of the Berlin family and the loss they sustained upon the death of William Teasley Berlin in the yellow fever epidemic of 1879. The letters are stored in the Memphis and Shelby County Room with A History of Yellow Fever in Memphis and several other small collections related to the yellow fever epidemics in Memphis. -- During the Civil War, William Berlin served in A Company of the 17th Cavalry in West Tennessee. Following the war, he was senior partner of W.T. Berlin and Company, a real estate and mortgage company. He lived with his wife, Clorinda, two young daughters, Lillian and Maye, and his two teenage sisters, Lucy and Mollie. -- It is an especially poignant that William Berlin, having survived the Civil War and the yellow fever epidemics of 1873 and 1878, died in the 1879 epidemic. The winter of 1878-79 was mild, and later scientific research confirmed that the aedes aegypti mosquito, which carried the disease, was able to survive the winter in barns, homes and other sheltered locations. The return of hot, humid weather in the summer of 1879 brought another outbreak of yellow fever. The reason that fewer people died in 1879 arises from the fact that a case of the viral disease confers immunity, and nearly every person in Memphis contracted yellow fever in 1878. The devastating 1878 yellow fever epidemic that raged in Memphis and throughout the Mississippi River Valley was a disaster of such magnitude that it has overshadowed the significant epidemic in the late summer of 1879. The 500 or more victims of the 1879 epidemic represented about ten percent of the death toll of 1878, which largely accounts for the fact that this outbreak of yellow fever in Memphis has received scant attention.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Firestone Tire and Rubber Company Memphis Plant Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Material in the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company Collection provides important information on the company that at one time was the largest manufacturer in Memphis, employing thousands of individuals working in a facility that covered several hundred acres in North Memphis.  The parent company in Akron, Ohio, was founded in 1900 by Harvey S. Firestone, Sr., one of America’s great business entrepreneurs.  The Memphis Firestone plant was built in 1936 and incorporated the Murray Wood Products Company plant, which was owned by Fisher Body Corporation.  This facility was the initial unit for the new Firestone tire manufacturing operation.  Raymond C. Firestone, one of the founder’s four sons, was transferred from California to head the operation of the Mid-South facility.  The Memphis plant grew rapidly, soon out-producing its early goals, and the communities of Frayser and New Chicago were developed to provide homes near the Firestone operation for the company workforce.  In 1956, the Firestone Company advertised its Memphis plant as the “largest single tire producing unit in the world on 35 acres of floor space, producing 1 out of every 17 tires manufactured in the U.S.”  The ad pointed out that the Memphis plant employed some 4,000 men and women and contributed more than $25,000,000 annually to the local economy.  Growth continued through the 60s and 70s, but the plant was forced to close in 1983.  The collection includes one box of print materials and one large album of photographs, which depict all phases of tire manufacturing and production at the Memphis plant.  In addition to the materials in this collection, the Memphis Information File contains more than one hundred newspaper clippings on the Firestone Company, and the Memphis Room Photograph Collection includes 34 photographs, many showing the initial 1936 construction.  The Memphis Room also has bound copies of the company’s annual reports from 1938 through 1973.  This material provides an important historical record of the company’s significant role in the economic history of Memphis.  Materials in this collection were donated to the Public Library after the close-down phase of the Firestone plant had been completed.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Official Papers of William B. Fowler</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N14-N15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The William Fowler collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Fowler’s grandson, John W. Fowler, in 1985. William Bingham Fowler, born in 1886, served the city of Memphis as an engineer over a span of 69 years. During this time, he was responsible for turning Memphis from a town of “cobblestones and wooden blocks” into a city of paved streets and interstate highways. He accomplished all of this while serving under eleven different mayors, including the illustrious E.H. Crump. -- Fowler began his career with the city as a water boy in the sewers in 1900. While attending Memphis High School, he received an appointment to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. However, after a short time he returned to Memphis. Except for his brief stay at the academy, he never attended college, primarily for financial reasons. He acquired his substantial engineering skills while on the job. -- In 1907 Fowler married Sydney Shepard, who died ten years later of scarlet fever. The year of his first wife’s death, Fowler became superintendent of the Memphis park system. While serving in this position, he helped design and develop the Memphis Zoo. Fowler went on to marry Margaret Williams, a former teacher and school principal from Lucy, Tennessee in 1921. Margaret Williams Fowler became the first chair of the City Beautiful Commission and was also active in the Nineteenth Century Club, the Memphis Council of Parent-Teacher Associations, and the Tennessee Daughters of the American Revolution. -- After working for the city for several years, Fowler went into business for himself. His business, Koehler-Fowler Construction Company, failed because of the shortages caused by World War I. He then returned to work for the city, where he continued to serve until 1969. -- On September 1, 1918, Fowler was appointed Assistant City Engineer. Just nine months later, he was promoted to City Engineer, a position he held until his official retirement in 1962. In 1937 he and his staff designed a 16 million dollar system for controlling flooding from the Mississippi and Wolf Rivers and Nonconnah Creek. He was also responsible for over 400 miles of sewer systems, which alleviated sanitation problems. Under his guidance, roads throughout the city were widened and paved, and improvements such as the Avalon viaduct on Poplar were added. -- In 1955 Fowler designed the routes for the interstate highway through and around the city. His tenure with the city and his relationships with other officials were not always secure. During the flood of 1937, Mayor Watkins Overton fired him for not being at his desk in a time of emergency – he had gone with Mr. Crump to observe the levee outside the city limits on Third Street. He was quickly rehired. In the 1940s, Fowler had been responsible for the paving of Peabody Avenue, on which Crump lived. A huge crack developed into a pothole in front of Crump’s home. Crump was so upset that he would not approve Fowler’s appointments for seven years. -- Even after his retirement at age 75 in 1962, Fowler continued to work for the city as a consultant. He worked with the same secretary and used his former office, his same desk and drew the same salary of $434 a month as he had done before. -- The Official Papers of William B. Fowler include correspondence with city officials and other associates from 1927-1957, and miscellaneous items such as reports, papers and campaign brochures. The contents of this extensive collection also include materials related to the career of Margaret Fowler, such as meeting minutes from the Memphis Council of Parent-Teacher Associations, scrapbooks, photographs of Memphis City Beautiful Commission activities and yearbooks from the Commission and the Nineteenth Century Club.</dc:description>

<dc:title>FreeWorld Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J10, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>David Skypeck and Richard Cushing were playing with The Midnight Syncopators every Wednesday night at Lafayette’s Corner in August of 1986, but by November the horn players had left the band. They played on even though members continued to leave the group. One night veteran jazz saxophonist Herman Green and trumpeter Nokie Taylor walked in off the street, pulled out their horns and started playing with the band in the middle of a set. -- This initial jam session led to a number of subsequent collaborations. In September 1987, Cushing and trumpeter Willy Waldman approached Green about forming a new band. They were joined by guitarist Clint Goodwin, Chuck Fields and sound technicians Dave Aron from Sun Studio and Vince Pratt, who occasionally played rhythm guitar. -- FreeWorld played its first gig at the South End restaurant in October 1987 and the band quickly became a local favorite. The initial set lists were made up of an eclectic mix of songs by other performers, but it was not long before the band members began writing original material. FreeWorld’s music blended jazz, soul, blues, funk and psychedelic rock, and improvisation was the key to the band’s identity, with each performance taking on a distinct personality depending on the current lineup. -- FreeWorld’s first self-titled CD, released in 1993, was a local hit and gave the band opportunities to perform frequently. Unfortunately, the group began to unravel as its frenzied touring pace wore on the members. The band had numerous personnel changes over the years but continued to gain exposure and popularity. The band embarked on two European tours in 1993 and released several successful CDs including You Are Here, Diversity and Live From Memphis. -- FreeWorld also collaborated with numerous guest artists and recording professionals including veteran sound technician Jim Gaines, who began his career at Stax, guitarist Calvin Newborn, John Fishman and Page McConnell of Phish, violinist Peter Hyrka, Bono from U2, Kenny Neil, The Radio Kings and Ivan Neville. In addition to enjoying commercial success, the members of FreeWorld were presented with numerous awards by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS). -- FreeWorld members also acted as movers and shakers behind the scenes in the music community, becoming involved in numerous side projects and promoting up-and-coming acts as well. Band members, most notably Richard Cushing, were active in local organizations such as NARAS and the Shelby County Music Commission. -- FreeWorld achieved wide-ranging commercial and critical success, but its reputation was largely built on its live shows that received a great deal of press coverage. Because of this, newspaper and journal articles reviewing works and updating fans on the group’s status provide an excellent source of material to outline the band’s history. Richard Cushing, the executive producer, lead vocalist, bassist, co-songwriter, musical director, band leader and business manager maintained a collection of items relating to the band since its founding. These materials were given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Cushing in 2005. -- The FreeWorld Collection is primarily made up of copies of press releases, sound recordings, video recordings, photographs, posters and miscellaneous documents outlining the development and history of the band. This chronologically arranged collection not only gives a history of FreeWorld, but also gives insight into the Memphis music scene from the late 1980s to the early 21st century.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Future Memphis, Inc. Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J10-J11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Future Memphis, Inc., was founded and incorporated in February 1961, when a group of business leaders meeting over lunch decided that the city needed an organization to determine what efforts could be made in business, education, the arts, or in any other aspect of life in Memphis to move the city forward. The charter members were Walter P. Armstrong, Jr., R.H. Allen, Rose L. Bartlett, Hubert A. McBride and John J. Doggett, Jr. In June 1961, Future Memphis, Inc., announced the names of its directors and named Frederick F. Riley as the first executive director. -- At the first meeting of Future Memphis, Inc., the members adopted ten objectives for the organization. These objectives included providing a source of sound backing for worthy projects, obtaining the opinion of successful business leaders on problems of community interest, coordinating and supporting efforts of other organizations, providing a non-political avenue of approach for industrial developers, providing means for gathering data and supporting a broad economic study and long-term development plan. The group also sought to encourage the development of new industries, support the expansion of existing businesses, promote sports and cultural events, develop public relations and advertising for the city and maintain a non-partisan interest in honest and efficient government. -- Future Memphis, Inc., was instrumental in creating the proposal for the mayor-council government which began in 1968, vigorously supporting the routing of Interstate 40 through Overton Park in 1976, establishing the Airport Authority and founding the Memphis Community Foundation (now the Community Foundation of Greater Memphis). The organization also produced a comprehensive city-county consolidation study, provided partial funding for the feasibility study for the National Civil Rights Museum in 1985, developed the Memphis Crime Report in cooperation with The Commercial Appeal and Guardsmark in 1987 and established the Literacy Foundation. -- The organization “formed for the purpose of promoting the welfare and orderly future development of the city of Memphis, Tennessee, and its environs” worked quietly behind the scenes for 34 years before voting in June of 1995 to cease operation on July 31, 1995. New nonprofit groups had begun to support many of the causes that Future Memphis had contributed to over the years, and a more complex business environment in the city led to the loss of some top leaders. -- The Future Memphis, Inc., Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1995 by executive director Edward O. Williams on behalf of the members of the organization. The collection contains correspondence, contracts, memoranda, proposals and reports related to the civic activities of Future Memphis. The collection includes information on the Charter of Incorporation and City Development, crime, annexation, the consolidation of Memphis and Shelby County government, Memphis City Schools and the Center City Riverfront Plan. In addition to this collection, the Memphis and Shelby County Room also houses the papers of Frank Holloman, who served as executive director of Future Memphis from 1972-1980.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Gayoso House and the Gayoso Hotel Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In the mid-19th century, the Gayoso House was known up and down the Mississippi River for its elegance and hospitality. Nestled in a grove of trees above terraces and landscaped gardens, it had a view of the river for fifteen miles. From the inn’s own wharf, the rich and famous entered the hotel over a red carpet. -- Construction of Gayoso House, which was founded by Robertson Topp, Archibald Walker, and William L. Vance, began in 1842. Its chief designer, James Dakin, was one of the foremost architects of the day and the designer of the Gayoso’s greatest rival, the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans. -- The hotel was named for Governor Manuel Luis Gayoso de Lemos, Spanish governor of the Natchez district, who was known for his hospitality and appreciation of beauty. The owners of the Gayoso attempted to carry on the traditions associated with Governor De Lemos. -- However, as years passed the famous landmark fell on hard times. By 1876, according to a quote from the June, 23, 1876, Commercial Appeal, it was “partly inhabited by a low class of people, and the stench that pervades the halls and rooms is perfectly horrible; indeed it is a pestilential breeding spot.” -- After a fire in 1879, there was apparently an effort to return the Gayoso House to its former glory. In 1885, as a part of this attempt, a grand piano was ordered for the price of $1,450. Despite these efforts, there was talk of demolishing the building before a second fire completely destroyed it in 1899. -- On the first anniversary of the fire which had destroyed its predecessor, ground was broken for the new Gayoso Hotel on the spot of the original hotel. When the hotel opened in 1904, it featured an elaborate grand piano bearing the Gayoso crest. The new Gayoso also featured a series of murals by Alonzo Wells which depicted the cross-country journey and death of Hernando de Soto. -- The Gayoso Hotel was sold to the Goldsmith family in 1948, and the building was gradually incorporated into Goldsmith’s Department Store. The Gayoso closed its doors on December 31, 1962, but the history of the Gayoso House and the Gayoso Hotel remains a part of the city’s heritage. -- The material in this collection comes from the Gayoso Hotel Scrapbook, which was compiled by Margaret Francis from memorabilia collected by hotel owners and managers. The material includes newspaper clippings, photographs, a menu, a key and hotel stationery.</dc:description>

<dc:title>E.W. Mason Church of God in Christ Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G29</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The E.W. Mason Church of God in Christ Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center in 2008 by Elsie Washington Mason’s niece, Mrs. Cenetta J. Lee.  Consisting of church records, correspondence, photographs, a scrapbook and sermons, the collection chronicles the history of the nation’s largest African American Pentecostal denomination.  In addition, the material also details the life and ministry of church founder Bishop C.H. Mason and his third wife Elsie Washington Mason. -- Born into slavery on a plantation near Memphis on September 8, 1862, Charles Harrison Mason founded Saint Paul Church in 1897 in Lexington, Mississippi.  Ten years later, in 1907, Mason attended the Asuza Street Pentecostal revival in Los Angeles and was profoundly influenced by the experience.  After five weeks in California, Mason relocated to Memphis where he incorporated the Church of God in Christ.  Mason served as presiding bishop of the church until his death on November 17, 1961.  By 1917, Mason’s denomination had spread to several cities including Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis.  In the 1920s and 1930s, COGIC became one of the fastest growing churches in the world as it expanded into Africa and the Caribbean.  COGIC continued to grow throughout the 20th and 21st centuries and by 2007 its worldwide membership stood at 6.5 million.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Papers of Memphis Mayor Walter Chandler</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N15-N32, O29-O30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Walter Chandler, who served as Mayor of Memphis during World War II, and then again briefly in 1955, was born in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1887. He moved to Memphis as a teenager and attended public schools. After earning a law degree from the University of Tennessee in 1909, he served as Assistant Attorney General of Shelby County and as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Chandler served as a U.S. Army Captain during World War I, and participated in the Muese-Argonne Offensive and the Battle of San Mihiel. Following the war, Chandler served as a member of the Tennessee Senate and was appointed as the City Attorney for Memphis in 1928. While serving in this position, Chandler began his professional association with Edward Hull Crump, who dominated Memphis politics for decades. -- Chandler served three terms in Congress before being encouraged by Crump to run for mayor of Memphis in 1940. After serving as mayor for six years, Chandler entered private law practice. He served on the boards of the Cossitt Library and LeMoyne College, and served again briefly as Mayor from October to December of 1955 after the death of Frank Tobey. -- The Papers of Memphis Mayor Walter Chandler consist of materials from his professional life. The material is organized chronologically, and begins with newspaper clippings from the 1930s, including some articles written by Chandler. The papers include office files and photographs from his service as mayor during World War II. During the war, an army supply depot and Navy base were located in Memphis, and the city served as headquarters to the Second Army. The expanding role of the city during the war is addressed in these materials. -- Throughout his career as mayor, Chandler was associated with and influenced by E.H. Crump. Chandler’s papers include correspondence between these two leaders, which provides insight into the authority of Crump’s political machine in the city of Memphis. -- This collection does not include materials from Chandler’s brief service as Mayor of Memphis in 1955. Materials from this period of his service are included in the papers of Mayor Frank Tobey, which are also located in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Roberta Church Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R9-R10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Sara Roberta Church, daughter of Sara Parody Johnson and Robert Reed Church, Jr., was born in Memphis into one of the nation’s most prominent African American families. Her grandfather, Robert Reed Church, Sr., was acknowledged as the South’s first African American millionaire and her father, Robert R. Church, Jr., had been the leading organizer of the Memphis Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which received its charter in 1918. Roberta Church was educated at LeMoyne Normal School, an elementary and high school, which later became LeMoyne College. She continued her education at Northwestern University in Chicago, where she received Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in social sciences. -- Proudly following in the footsteps of her distinguished family, Church was active in politics and worked for social justice. After her father’s sudden death in April 1952, she ran in his place for a position on the Republican State Executive Committee of Tennessee and was elected, making her the first African American woman to be elected to public office in Shelby County. Following the election in 1952 of Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Church was appointed Minority Groups Consultant in the Department of Labor. She next served in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, overseeing various federal and state programs. -- Church served in other prominent national positions during her nearly 30 years of public service in Washington until her retirement and return to Memphis. After her retirement, Church continued her involvement in a wide range of activities and organizations including the Shelby County Historical Commission and the Phillis Wheatley Society. Church was especially interested in Elmwood Cemetery, where several Church family members are buried in the mausoleum. -- Perhaps the most significant undertaking of Church’s retirement years was her sustained effort to have Church Park restored as a memorial to her grandfather, Robert R. Church, Sr. When it was built at the turn of the 19th century, beautiful Church’s Park, was the setting of Church’s Auditorium, which was one of the largest in the South. Many prominent individuals appeared at the auditorium, including President Theodore Roosevelt and Booker T. Washington. However, the auditorium had become dilapidated and been torn down, and the park had fallen into disrepair. Roberta Church worked with other Memphians to have the park restored, and it was re-dedicated in 1987. -- Materials in the collection were given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Roberta Church over a period of several years and include personal and business correspondence, photographs, awards, newspaper clippings, greeting cards and memorabilia. Much of the collection relates to Church’s career in government service and her active role in the National Republican Party. Also included in the collection is extensive information on Roberta Church’s efforts to restore Church Park. Portions of the collection pertain to Church’s family members, including her aunt, Annette Church, sister of Robert R. Church, Jr., and Mary Church Terrell, older half-sister of Robert R. Church, Jr. -- The papers of the Church family, including those of Robert R. Church, Sr. and Jr., Annette Elaine Church and some papers belonging to Roberta Church were given by Roberta Church to the University of Memphis in 1976. Researchers may wish to visit the Mississippi Valley Collection at the University to view this extensive collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Circuit Playhouse Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Circuit Playhouse Programs Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center by several individuals over many years.  The programs were then gathered together to create this collection. -- The Circuit Playhouse was formed in the summer of 1965 when Jackie Nichols and Walter Slaughter formed a troop of student actors to perform in churches and civic centers.  The first production was A Life in New York by Anna Cora Monatt.  Professor Ray Hill was the director.  Various Broadway productions were presented during the next four summers. -- In 1969, the old Memphis Civic Ballet Academy closed and was available to rent.  The decision was made to rent and to incorporate.  The Fantasticks was the first official production on November 20, 1969. -- In 1971, the rented building was sold.  A new home was found at 1947 Poplar across from Overton Park.  Overton Square, Inc. invited Circuit, Inc. to move to the vacated Lafayette Music Room in 1975, but the offer was turned down.  In 1981, the board of directors voted to purchase the Ritz-Guild-Evergreen movie house at 1705 Poplar as a new home for the theater.  Circuit Playhouse remains at this location. -- Customers interested in the development of theater in Memphis may also wish to consult the Theatre Memphis Programs Collection, Playhouse on the Square Programs Collection, Memphis Open Air Theater Collection and the Ethel Taylor Maxwell Collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Civil War Letters and Documents Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B26</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Civil War Letters and Documents Collection is a compilation of several small groups of papers acquired by the Memphis and Shelby County Room at different times and from various sources. The collection includes correspondence, business documents, government papers and other miscellaneous pieces. It also includes a personal diary, veterans’ reunion memorabilia, and an extensive collection of Harper’s Weekly prints. The varied material in the collection provides several distinct views of the Civil War period. -- The most significant group of papers is those pertaining to Dr. Robert Wood Mitchell, a prominent Memphis physician. These documents were donated by Willie Ayers, Dr. Mitchell’s great-nephew, and relate primarily to Dr. Mitchell’s military service as a surgeon during the Civil War. Included in these papers are two pre-war naval documents, a parole certificate, an amnesty oath, and a few post-war Confederate memorial postcards. A journal of surgical notes compiled by another Confederate medical officer, Dr. J.S. White, provides an additional view of a surgeon’s duties during the war. -- The collection also includes copies of four letters written by Dabney Minor Scales to his father related to his service in the Confederate Navy aboard the Flag Ship Savannah, the Steamer Arkansas, and the C.S.S. Shenandoah. The letters were donated by Scales’ daughter, Mrs. Yates Welford, and include detailed accounts of skirmishes at sea and a sketch of the Arkansas. -- A very important piece in this collection is the diary of Pickney Latham, a member of the Fourth Regiment of Tennessee Volunteers. The diary begins April 25, 1862, near Corinth, Mississippi, and ends on July 16 of the following year. There is also a hand-written letter to his sister, a photograph of Latham and a number of related newspaper articles. -- The collection also includes examples of Confederate bills used throughout the war, state and city notes dated prior-to and after the war and private issue notes from the years 1861 and 1862. Several documents in the collection seek to authenticate a battle-scarred tree trunk taken from the area of Brice’s Cross Roads, where General Nathan Bedford Forrest led his troops into battle. Pieces of the tree were to be sold in an effort to raise funds for a memorial monument to Forrest. Also included is a copy of a manuscript letter by General Forrest. A scrapbook of unknown provenance contains newspaper clippings, the majority of which date from the years 1860 to 1865. The compiler included articles that detail both pro-union and pro-secessionist arguments. Most of the articles appear to be from Memphis newspapers. Material on veterans’ reunions is comprised of pamphlets, programs, ribbons and medals. -- Finally, the collection contains an index of Harper’s Weekly Civil War prints that are included in the photograph and print collection of the Memphis and Shelby County Room. Harper’s Weekly, a leading 19th century periodical, was distributed nationwide, and its publication survived well into the 20th century. Harper’s Weekly relied heavily on images, and its weekly Civil War issues were eagerly sought around the country. Following the war, a compilation of selected issues was published as Harper’s History of the Great Rebellion, and several of the prints in the collection are from this publication. In addition, there are items from Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly and The London Illustrated News.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Howard Association Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S30 (Part of Yellow Fever)</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Roane Waring donated The Howard Association Collection to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1973. The collection consists of two important pieces relating to the history of yellow fever in Memphis. The first is the 1879 minute book of the Howard Association of which Roane Waring’s father, Thomas Roane Waring was secretary. The second piece is a large framed portrait of the members of the Howard Association in 1878. An inner circle on the portrait contains images of the ten members who gave their lives serving the sick and dying of the Memphis area. The collection is housed with A History of Yellow Fever in Memphis and several other small collections related to the devastating yellow fever epidemics in Memphis. -- The minutes, which are dated from August 10, 1879, through April 1880, address the workings of the Association, and reveal the impact that yellow fever had on the people of Memphis. The minute book covers business matters such as a change in the by-laws, investigation of various complaints, appeals for funds, instructions to Howard Association doctors and the ordering of supplies for the sick. -- The minutes include a motion that only yellow fever patients would be cared for, and in order to curtail expenses, supplies would be furnished only to yellow fever patients. The minutes from September 10 authorized $10 “for the burial expenses of Mrs. Maggie Bennett, late a nurse of this Assn.” The minutes of April 5, 1880, contain a great deal of history on the Howard Association’s work in the 1878 epidemic and the desire of the organization to publish reports on its work, “along with reports on the work of the Citizens Relief Committee and the other charitable and benevolent Assns of our City that were collaborators with us in that epidemic and such other information pertaining thereto as might be of interest to the public at large.”</dc:description>

<dc:title>Robert Cohn Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Robert Cohn was born in Bremen, Germany, in 1874. He moved to Memphis at the age of 26 and began working in the cotton industry. He then shifted his focus to the operation of the Heart’s Delight Dairy and Poultry Farm at Forest Hill, which served as a source for practical experience for agricultural high school students in Memphis. Cohn also served briefly as business manager and treasurer of the A.B.C. Trailer Truck Company. Cohn was an impassioned patriot, frequently writing patriotic essays. He also used his talent for writing to support flood control measures and to call attention to the needs and struggles of farmers. He was instrumental in establishing a Red Cross Chapter in Memphis and is considered the father of the national “Plant-a-Garden” movement. In addition, he served as a Mason and Shriner and was a member of the City Club. -- The Robert Cohn Papers consist of essays, pamphlets, speeches, and newspaper clippings related to Cohn’s interest in farming, flood control, World War II and patriotic issues. Cohn sent the material to Toof Brown of S.C. Toof and Company so that a book could be compiled from the material after his death. The collection was found among the belongings of Mr. Brown after his death and was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mr. Lester Presson.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Annie W. Conner Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B5</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Little is known about Anna (Annie) W. Conner; however, more can be ascertained about her ancestry. John O’Connor, the first of Annie’s ancestors to settle in America, migrated from Ireland in 1745 and settled in Culpeper County, Virginia, and several generations of Annie’s direct forbearers lived in northern Virginia. The O’Conners were active in land speculation and eventually owned land in several states, including property on what is now McLean Avenue in Memphis. Annie’s father, Charles Conner, married Eloise Colman of Brownsville, Tennessee, around 1853. He died near Brownsville in 1863, and Annie was his only surviving child. Eloise remarried L.C. Gillaspie (interchangeably spelled Gillespie), who became Annie’s guardian and the administrator of Charles Conner’s property in Tennessee. -- The Annie W. Conner Collection offers a glimpse into the lives of this family of land owners and speculators during the middle period of the 19th century. The collection, made up primarily of personal and business correspondence, provides insight into the economic and political concerns and problems of the South during the period. Much of the correspondence was written by Annie Conner’s uncle, William Conner, who wrote about his negative opinion of the Know-Nothing party, and his regard for the new Republican Party, the Whigs, and the Democrats – political views which were shared by many large landholders of the region. -- The Annie W. Conner Collection, which was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Jane Hosmer Teal Rogers, serves as a valuable resource for researchers of the South during the mid-1800s. The papers contain information about agriculture such as crop conditions and prices and the effects of weather on farming. The collection also includes letters in which family members discuss buying and selling slaves. The papers provide insight into the economy of the period through documents such as a will, a deed, and receipts for many items such as land, medical care, room and board, and gravestones. Charles Connor’s letter in which he writes to his mother to ask for approval to marry a young woman, and Eloise Conner’s letter in which she states her belief that a woman takes more risks than a man in marrying, give insight into social customs and beliefs of the period. The collection includes references to matters which greatly affected the lives of people in this time period, including disease (references are made to a cholera outbreak among a farmer’s group of hogs and yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis), death and religion.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Marie Connor Aviation History Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K21</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Donated to the Memphis Public Library in 1989 by Marie Connor, the collection contains a wide range of aviation news and memorabilia from the Memphis area.  These include articles clipped from local newspapers about aviation events and history, flyers and advertisements put out by southern air companies, newsletters, press releases, speeches dealing with specific aviation events in the area, and index cards filled with Connor’s personal notes from research and interviews regarding local aviation history.  The collection also contains a large album of pictures, ranging from close-ups of planes through the ages to the changing outerwear of stewardesses to famous local pilots such as the noted aviatrix Phoebe Omlie.  The collection includes several miscellaneous items such as an early ticket clarifying one’s status as an aviation student and an invitation for an “aviation dance” from 1918 and printed on material from the wing of a plane. -- While composed mostly of secondary sources, this collection provides an abundance of information and history related to aviation in the general Memphis area.  These include newspaper articles about the first flight in the city in 1910 and photos and memorabilia added from the World Runway Grand Opening at the Memphis Airport in 2000.  Contemporary coverage of crucial events also provides significant historical insight into the development of aviation as a critical southern industry.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Ida Cooper Genealogical Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J24-J26</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Ida Cooper, daughter of Mary Magdalene Black and John Henry Pitts, was born in 1895. She married Howard Wilbur Cooper in 1920, and had two children, Virginia Joyce Cooper Appling and Howard Wilbur Cooper, Jr. -- Mrs. Cooper lived in Shelby County in the Arlington community and worked as an accountant at Ellendale Utility. Her particular interest was in the historical backgrounds and genealogies of old families – primarily in the Morning Sun, Ellendale, and Bartlett communities of Shelby County. She researched and recorded information on many family and church cemeteries, and this information has been alphabetized and listed in Gravestone Inscriptions From Shelby County Cemeteries, Volume III, which is available in the Memphis and Shelby County Room. -- The Ida Cooper Genealogical Collection, which was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by her daughter, Joyce Appling, consists of Mrs. Cooper’s correspondence and notes concerning family genealogy and community history. The extensive collection contains information about families, land, houses and burials gathered from her many visits with various families and a lifetime spent corresponding with other genealogists and saving records on family and community history. Ida Cooper died in 1982 in Heber Springs, Arkansas, and was buried at Morning Sun Presbyterian Church Cemetery. Her collection of papers, clippings and correspondence serves as an especially valuable resource for researchers interested in the history and genealogy of Shelby County.</dc:description>

<dc:title>E.H. Crump Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B28-B35, C1-C32, F1-F21, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Edward Hull Crump was born near Holly Springs, Mississippi, in 1874. He was raised by his mother, Mollie Nelms Crump, after his father, a cotton planter and former Confederate officer, died during the yellow fever epidemic of 1878. When he was 19 years old, Crump moved to Memphis determined to succeed in business. After struggling to find work, Crump was hired as the bookkeeper for a carriage making company. He went on to found the E.H. Crump Company, a large and successful insurance firm. In 1902 he married Bessie Byrd McLean, and they had three sons: Edward, Jr., Robert and John. -- Crump first pursued his political ambitions when he sought the position of director of the Memphis Business Men’s Club in 1904. In 1905 he ran for a seat on the board of public works supervisors, the lower body of the bicameral legislative council. Voters elected Crump by an overwhelming majority, beginning one of the most celebrated and controversial political careers in 20th century America. -- In September 1907 Crump resigned his seat on the board of public works supervisors to successfully run for the board of fire and police commissioners, which was the upper body of the legislative council. Crump then went on to run a successful campaign for mayor in 1909. During his five year term as mayor, he enacted many progressive reforms, including the creation of a juvenile court, improvement of public health services and the regulation of utilities. -- Crump’s greatest political handicap was his refusal to fully enforce prohibition. Tennessee outlawed the sale of liquor in 1909 and anger over the mayor’s anti-prohibition policy contributed to his ouster from the mayor’s office in 1915. However, this did not weaken his political ambitions. Six months after his ouster Crump was elected county trustee, and from that position he continued to gain political power. -- In 1930 Crump was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where he served through 1934. Crump was a strong supporter of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and voted for every piece of New Deal legislation during the president’s first hundred days in office. Roosevelt’s gratitude for Crump’s support benefited the citizens of Shelby County greatly. By the end of the 1930s, over $15 million was spent locally by the federal government on welfare and relief and an additional $6.4 million was spent on construction. Crump was again elected mayor of Memphis in 1939 but served only a few minutes. He resigned in favor of Congressman Walter Chandler immediately after taking the oath of office. Crump ran in Chandler’s place so the congressman could remain in Washington to vote for President Roosevelt’s neutrality legislation. -- Late in his career, Crump abandoned the Democratic Party and aligned himself with the States Rights Party, which caused him to lose political clout. Crump experienced one of his greatest defeats when voters elected anti-Crump Democrats Estes Kefauver for the U.S. Senate and Gordon Browning for governor in 1948. However, Crump remained a powerful political force in Tennessee until his death in 1954. -- The E.H. Crump Collection contains correspondence, government reports, campaign advertisements and other material from the years 1910 to 1954. The papers include information on prohibition, Crump’s ouster from the mayor’s office, and several card file indexes which list city employees by ward. The papers contain lists of people who received gifts from Crump and numerous photographs of Crump, his family and associates. Also included are magazine and newspaper articles from publications such as Colliers, The Saturday Evening Post and Time magazine which document the evolution of Crump’s national image.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Captain Rees Vernon Downs Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B9-B10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Captain Rees Vernon Downs Papers were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Captain Downs’ sister, Bess Jenkins. The primary emphasis of the collection is river steamboats. The collection contains scrapbooks devoted to stern and side-wheeler boats which were compiled by an individual named F.L. Wooldridge. The collection also contains a manuscript list of steamboats compiled by the “River Historian” Wooldridge, which lists the name of the steamboat, the number of cylinders, boiler size, physical dimensions, line and fate. The remainder of the collection is comprised of Captain Downs’ personal mementos. -- Captain Rees Vernon Downs was a born and bred river man. He was born in 1878 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and spent his early years on the Arkansas River. After studying mechanical and electrical engineering at the University of Arkansas for two years, he began working on steamboats. He began as a cub on the Eugene, a Memphis and Little Rock packet, and was eventually granted his first government license to pilot the Arkansas River in 1900. He went on to hold pilot and master certification on portions of the Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas and Ohio Rivers. He was a master of the Wolf River from its mouth at the foot of Beale Street to the North Second Street Bridge in Memphis. He served as a pilot and captain of several river boats, including the Lucille Now land, the Georgia Lee, the Fred Harold and the Kate Adams. In 1912 he was appointed a U.S. steamboat inspector in St. Louis, and he became the first superintendent of the Federal Barge Line out of St. Louis in 1918. Captain Downs retired in the 1930s, but renewed his license in 1942 and was prepared to assist in any war efforts. -- Captain Downs lived in Memphis from 1920 until his death in 1955. He served as a charter member of the Propeller Club and was active in the Engineers Club, Pilot Club and the Memphis Area Chamber of Commerce. He was a member of the Vestry of St. James Episcopal Church in Memphis and served as Director of the church’s University of Practical Living. He is buried in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Art Association Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N2-N3, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Memphis Art Association was organized in 1914 by Florence McIntyre, a local artist and supporter of art education in Memphis, and members of the Nineteenth Century Club, a local women’s club dedicated to community-wide philanthropic activities.  The association was established to promote the serious study of art and encourage interest in the fine arts.  During its initial years of operation, the association hosted exhibitions and lectures and met at the homes of various members. -- Rosa Lee, an art patron and a good friend of Florence McIntyre’s, encouraged the Memphis Art Association to form a school to provide art education through free classes.  The association opened the James Lee Memorial Academy of Arts in 1925 in Rosa Lee’s home at 690 Adams Avenue, with McIntyre serving as the director. -- The James Lee Academy offered courses for credit, teacher training and children’s classes.  The school was supported by dues and donations, and the classes were free to the public.  Courses offered included drawing, painting, design, theater arts, pottery, jewelry making and commercial art. -- Florence McIntyre continued to head the James Lee Academy until 1936 when a split occurred between the staff of the academy and the board of directors of the Memphis Art Association.  The disagreement resulted in the formation of the Memphis Academy of Arts, which changed its name to Memphis College of Art in 1985, while the James Lee Academy continued to offer free classes.  The James Lee Academy changed its name to the Free Art School of the Memphis Art Association in 1942 and ran until shortly after McIntyre’s death in 1963. -- Business and financial records, correspondence, photographs, lectures, essays and newspaper clippings make up The Memphis Art Association Collection.  The bulk of the materials date from 1916 to 1962.  The collection documents the activities of the Memphis Art Association, the James Lee Memorial Academy of Art and the Free Art School.  The collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 2003 by Victoria Hyrka Wilson, a student at the Memphis Art Association’s Free Art School.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Belle Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N3</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In September 1942 a new B-17 Flying Fortress was delivered to Bangor, Maine, to a crew of ten men led by Captain Robert Morgan.  The airplane was named the Memphis Belle in honor of Margaret Polk, Captain Morgan’s fiancée in Memphis. -- The Belle and her crew were sent to England to join the 91st Bombardment Group of the United States Eighth Air Force.  Their first mission was to bomb the locks at Brest, France on November 7, 1942.  After completing twenty-five missions, the Belle and her crew were sent back home for a “twenty-sixth mission,” which was a bond-selling tour throughout the United States. -- The Belle was the first B-17 bomber to successfully complete twenty-five missions and also the first bomber to return all of her crewmen home.  During the missions the crew dropped sixty tons of bombs in France, Germany and Belgium; shot down eight enemy fighters (and probably five others); damaged a dozen more; and flew approximately 20,000 combat miles.  The crew was decorated fifty-one times, with each member receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and three Oak Leaf Clusters.  Sergeant John Quinlan also received the Purple Heart for a minor injury he sustained in battle. -- Mayor Walter Chandler of Memphis obtained the Memphis Belle for the city on July 16, 1946 from an aircraft scrap yard in Altus, Oklahoma.  The purchase price was $350. With time, interest in the plane waned; and in 1950 it was given to the American Legion. It was taken to the Legion hut on the grounds of the National Guard Armory, where it remained for several years.  In 1977 it was removed to the new Air National Guard facilities at the Memphis International Airport, where it was partially refurbished by Memphis Area Vocational Technical Aviation School students.  Later in 1977 it was relinquished to the Air Force, who loaned it to The Memphis Belle Memorial Association, a non-profit organization.  The Belle was then housed for several years in a pavilion on Mud Island.  In 2003 the Belle was relocated to the Millington Airport.  A new museum to house the plane is planned for the area around Forest Hill-Irene Road and Bill Morris Parkway. -- The Memphis Belle collection was compiled from a number of sources.  While some of the donors are unknown, Mr. Frank Donofrio contributed many significant items to the original contents.  The collection includes maintenance records for 1942 and 1943 and correspondence which primarily addresses the city obtaining the plane or securing shelter for it.  Newspaper articles included in the collection address the condition of the plane or the attempts to find a permanent facility to house the aircraft.  Film reviews and post cards are also included in the collection.  A large poster of the Belle is housed with other posters in the Memphians During War Collection in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Civic Clubs - Jackson Boulevard and Rozelle Clubs</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N3</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>During the period between the world wars, civic or improvement clubs flourished as a way to provide service and entertainment to neighborhood residents.  At one time there were twenty-five clubs in Memphis which were loosely connected through their association with the Council of Civic Clubs.  These clubs were instrumental in persuading the city to improve and extend streets, provide better streetcar service, build schools and parks, and maintain healthful sanitary conditions.  There were few matters of local public interest which were not affected by the efforts of civic clubs.  During the depression the clubs provided neighborhood relief, and their meetings frequently included entertainment programs which served as a forum for local talent. -- This collection contains minutes, correspondence and other papers from two of these clubs – the Rozelle Civic Club and the Jackson Boulevard Improvement (later Civic) Club.  The collection was compiled from two separate gifts to the library.  Materials from the Rozelle Club were donated in 1980 by Stoy Bailey and the Rozelle/Annesdale Neighborhood Association.  Marion T. Gatti contributed most of the materials from the Jackson Boulevard Club in 1980 and added additional papers in 1987.  These materials provide insight into community relationships and the concerns of the clubs and present an important vignette of Memphis history.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Crippled Children's Hospital and School</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N4</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In the days before antibiotics, vaccinations, and public awareness of disease-related birth defects, many children in the Mid-South suffered from severely crippling illnesses such as poliomyelitis, tuberculosis of the spine and osteomyelitis as well as congenital defects such as clubbed feet and other deformities. -- In 1916, Dr. Willis C. Campbell, a nationally recognized orthopedic surgeon, approached the Good Deeds Circle of the Kings Daughters about undertaking the organization and management of a hospital to serve the needs of crippled children from Memphis and the Mid-South.  Throughout its sixty-three year existence, the Memphis Crippled Children’s Hospital and School cared for many hundreds of children without any cost to their families. -- Contained in this collection are annual reports, correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs and a brief history of the yearly operation of the institution.  The materials provide valuable information on the most active years of the Memphis Crippled Children’s Hospital and School.  These documents were a gift from Ellen D. Sugg of West Point, Mississippi.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Reverend Charles Carroll Parsons Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S30 (Part of Yellow Fever)</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Charles Carroll Parsons, Rector of St. Lazarus-Grace Episcopal Church, died September 6, 1878 while serving the people of Memphis during the terrible days of the 1878 yellow fever epidemic.  Although he had served the congregation less than three years, he was respected and admired by the church members and the community at large.  Parson’s popularity was especially significant because he had served as a commissioned officer in the Union Army during the Civil War, and his congregation was made up of a large number of former Confederate officers and leaders, including Jefferson Davis. -- Parsons was born in 1838 in Elyria Ohio.  He was raised in a prominent Ohio family and received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1854.  Upon graduation, Parsons and his Northern classmates were immediately assigned to various Union military units. -- Among the battles in which Parsons played an active part were the battles at Shiloh, Corinth, Stones River, Perryville and Richmond, Kentucky.  He received numerous commendations and promotions on the field.  While on leave of absence following a serious illness in 1862, he married Celia W.G. Lippett of Brooklyn, New York. -- Following the Civil War, Lieutenant Colonel Parsons served at several forts in Indian Territory.  He then returned to the Academy at West Point, where he served as an Assistant Professor for two years.  In 1868, Parsons met Charles Todd Quintard, second Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee.  The two men formed a close friendship, which inspired Parsons to study faith and religion.  In 1870 Parsons resigned his military commission to become a priest in the Episcopal Church.  He was ordained at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Memphis by his friend and mentor, Bishop Quintard. -- Parsons served at St. Mary’s of the Highlands in Cold Springs, New York and the Church of the Holy Innocents in Hoboken, New Jersey.  While in Hoboken, his young wife, Celia died.  Brokenhearted, Parsons moved to Memphis, where he became Rector of St. Lazarus-Grace in 1876.  In 1877, Parsons married Margaret Britton, niece of George Harris, the Dean of St. Mary’s Cathedral.  At the beginning of the yellow fever epidemic, Parsons sent Margaret and two of Celia’s sons to Margaret’s family plantation, Annandale to escape the effects of the disease.  After succumbing to yellow fever, Reverend Parsons was buried in Elmwood Cemetery next to Louis Sanford Schuyler, a priest who also died of yellow fever while serving the people of Memphis. -- The Reverend Charles Carroll Parsons Collection is stored in the Memphis and Shelby County Room with A History of Yellow Fever in Memphis and several other small collections related to the yellow fever epidemics in Memphis.  The papers include Parson’s obituary, letters and information on Parson’s military career.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B11-B25</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>A small group of people organized as Citizens to Preserve Overton Park with the goal of preventing Interstate 40 from intersecting Overton Park.  CPOP, as the organization became known, successfully stopped the construction of an east-west segment of the interstate.  It was a decades-long fight involving local, state and federal governments and eventually the Supreme Court of the United States. -- CPOP’s biggest weapon in its fight to prevent I-40 from going through Overton Park was literally its smallest—Anona Stoner, Memphis newcomer and CPOP secretary.  Mrs. Stoner saved most of the first collection of materials that the Board of CPOP donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center, including a complete file of CPOP’s minutes, treasurer’s reports, finances and correspondence.  President Arlo I. Smith’s materials also came with the first donation, but several other people also had collections they eventually contributed to the library, including: Sara Naill Hines, Treasurer; Mary Evelyn Deupree, for herself and husband, Vice President William Deupree; Sunshine Snyder, member and plaintiff; Irma O. Sternberg, member and author; Franklin Wright, Professor of History at Rhodes College; Agnes Bowe, President of Mid-Memphis Improvement Association; and Waldo Zimmermann, author and frequent letter-to-the-editor writer.  Covering the 1950s to the 1990s, the bulk of the items are from the 60s and 70s. -- CPOP spent many years trying to prevent Interstate 40 from going through Overton Park and the extensive correspondence is evidence of both their failures and final success.  Often a lonely voice of opposition, the Citizens to Preserve Overton Park refused to accept the seemingly inevitable progress of the United States Interstate System or at least the 7.6 mile segment that intersected Overton Park.  CPOP struggled against the combined forces of the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, Tennessee's United States Senators and Congressmen, several Tennessee Governors, the Tennessee Highway Department, the Memphis City Council, Memphis Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Business Association, The Memphis Commercial Appeal, The Memphis Press-Scimitar and many other opposition interests.  And yet, after decades of skirmishes and battles, Overton Park is still intact.</dc:description>

<dc:title>T.H. Hayes Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R22</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Thomas Henry Hayes, Jr., was born in Covington, Tennessee in 1902. His father, Thomas H. Hayes, Sr., founded T.H. Hayes Funeral Home, which was the oldest African American-owned business in Memphis when his son joined as funeral director in 1928. In 1933, T.H. Hayes, Jr., co-founded the Union Protective Life Insurance Company where he served in various executive positions until it was acquired by Universal Life Insurance Company in 1980. -- Hayes was appointed to the Memphis Transit Authority in 1964. He served as Vice President from 1966 until his resignation in 1970, and during his tenure was instrumental in the hiring of many of the city’s first African American bus drivers. Hayes assisted in the organization of such African American-owned businesses as the Memphis Mortgage Company and the Mutual Federal Savings and Loan Association. He also served for many years as a trustee of Metropolitan Baptist Church where he was a member for more than 50 years. -- Hayes is perhaps best known for being the owner of the Birmingham Black Barons baseball team of the Negro American Baseball League from 1939 to 1951. During these years Hayes and his managers recruited and developed numerous internationally known baseball stars including Willie Mays and LeRoy “Satchel” Paige. Mays, who was recruited by Hayes as a student at Fairfield High School in a suburb of Birmingham, played for the Black Barons for a year and a half before being discovered by talent scouts. -- The popularity of Negro baseball reached its height during the years of Hayes’ involvement, and his importance in the sport cannot be overstated. An article in the collection states that Hayes’ contributions to opening baseball to African Americans are more significant than those of Jackie Robinson. -- Thomas Hayes, Jr., had an impact on the lives of many until his death in 1982. He served as an example of a man who did not let the prejudice of others keep him from being a success as a businessman or from making a positive contribution to the city. -- The T. H. Hayes Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by his wife, Helen M. Hayes. The collection consists of correspondence, magazines, photographs, contracts and other memorabilia relating to Hayes’ ownership of the Birmingham Black Barons baseball team. The papers include articles about Hayes and Negro baseball in general, and two scrapbooks of newspaper articles about the Black Barons. Photographs and information from this collection have been used extensively in the preparation of books and visual presentations about Negro League baseball.</dc:description>

<dc:title>George W. Lee Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J13-J18, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The George W. Lee Collection was given to the library by his daughter Gilda Lee Robinson in 1985.  The large collection includes extensive and wide-ranging correspondence, copies of many of Lee’s speeches, hundreds of newspaper and magazine clippings, and many awards and certificates presented to Lee over the years.  An important part of this collection is the array of more than 400 photographs and the five large scrapbooks which contain photographs, clippings and letters.  In addition, there is one box of magazines and one box of personal Christmas cards. -- Lee was born near Indianola, Mississippi in 1894 to Reverend George Lee and Hattie Stringfellow Lee.  He first came to Memphis in 1912 where he worked each summer as a bellhop at the Gayoso Hotel to finance his education at Alcorn A&amp;M College. -- With the onset of World War I, Lee was accepted for admission to a segregated officer training school.  Through hard work and determination to succeed, Lee received his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army.  Decorated for bravery in battle, he was promoted to First Lieutenant.  This was a proud achievement for Lee, and the title “Lt. Lee” remained with him for the rest of his life. -- Following the war, Lee established himself in the growing African American insurance business, first as a salesman for Mississippi Life Insurance Company, and then later with Atlanta Life Insurance Company, where he became a vice president in 1964 and later served as director of public relations.  Lt. Lee went on to become one of the most successful African American business and political leaders in the South.  He utilized his talents as an articulate speaker and a polished writer in his long local and national political career. -- Politically, Lee’s first important work was in the Lincoln League, an African American Republican organization set up in 1916 by Robert R. Church.  By 1919, this group was chartered as the Lincoln League of American, and it was largely through political activism in the League that Lee attained national recognition.  Although the Republican Party in Memphis won few elections until the Eisenhower years, Lee, as the local GOP leader, exerted considerable influence through his alignment with East Tennessee Republicans. -- The fraternal order of Elks, where Lee had achieved prominence, provided a national platform for his oratorical and organizational abilities.  In later years, Lee worked through the Elks organization to call attention to civil rights struggles.  As Elks Grand Commissioner of Education, he emphasized black pride through education and the expansion of African American businesses. -- Lee acquired the nickname “Boswell of Beale Street” through his gift of describing African American life and music in his books and stories.  Beale Street: Where Blues Began received national acclaim and was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection.  River George and Beale Street Sundown also portray African American life in the South.  Lee’s admiration for W.C. Handy’s music and his recognition of its significance in American culture led him to support the creation of a park and statue in honor of the great blues writer. -- Lee was the recipient of numerous honors and awards during his lifetime.  Among them was the naming of the George W. Lee postal station at 826 Mississippi, the first to be named for an African American.  In 1973, his portrait was placed in the State Capitol at Nashville and that year he also received the R.Q. Venson Memorial Award presented by American Legion Post No. 27 in honor of his service to his country and community.  Lee remained an active member of the Memphis community until his death on August 1, 1976.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Jerry Lee Lewis Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J32</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Jerry Lee Lewis was born to Elmo and Mary Ethel Lewis in Ferriday, Louisiana in 1935.  Lewis sang and learned to play the piano in the local Assembly of God church, while also listening to Country music on the radio and Blues music in the African American neighborhoods of Ferriday.  At the age of fifteen Lewis began to play piano professionally, beginning a career that would last well into the 21st century. -- Lewis played in small clubs around Ferriday, and in Natchez and Nashville, but musical success eluded him.  In 1956, after noting the success of Elvis Presley, Lewis and his father sold thirteen dozen eggs to finance a trip to Memphis, where they hoped for him to audition for Sam Phillip’s Sun Records.  Lewis began recording for Sun in November of that year and in 1957 he released Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin On, and Great Balls of Fire.  Both cuts were top five hits on both the Pop and Country charts that year, which lead to an appearance on the Steve Allen television program in July.  The success of Lewis’ recordings and stage act made him one of the most popular performers during the early days of Rock and Roll. -- As musical tastes changed in the 1960s, Lewis abandoned Rock and Roll to focus on Country music.  Between 1968 and 1973, Lewis recorded several hit Country songs and appeared on the Grand Ole Opry.  Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and in 1989, MGM released a biographical film, Great Balls of Fire!, starring Dennis Quaid.  Continuing to perform through the beginning of the 21st century, Lewis is widely recognized as one of the founders of Rock and Roll. -- The Jerry Lee Lewis Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Jud and Rose McAfee Phillips in 2002.  The collection consists of business records, correspondence, legal documents, magazine and newspaper clippings, photographs and recordings related to Lewis’ life and musical career.  The bulk of the material relates to Lewis’ Country music career in the 1970s and his role as an elder statesman of Rock and Roll during the 1980s and 1990s.  The collection contains numerous clippings on the 1985 Sun Records reunion recording session with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Roy Orbison, which produced the album Class of ’55.  The collection also includes clippings related to the filming of Lewis’ movie biography Great Balls of Fire! and some information on Lewis’ family life and financial aspects of his career.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Selma S. Lewis Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R14-R15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Selma S. Lewis Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by her daughter, Jane Lewis Ross in April 2000.  The collection, which includes a wide range of newspaper clippings, correspondence, photographs and publications, provides significant information pertaining to the history and life of the Jewish and African American communities of Memphis.  The greater portion of the collection is composed of local Jewish history and biographies.  Also included are manuscript copies of Lewis’ books, The Angel of Beale Street: A Biography of Julia Ann Hooks, A Biblical People in the Bible Belt: The Jewish Community of Memphis, Tennessee, 1840s-1960s and her dissertation “Social Religion and the Sanitation Strike.”  Also of importance are the transcripts of oral interviews with members of the African American community, which were conducted by Selma Lewis and Marjean Kremer in 1978 as part of the research for the Pink Palace Museum exhibit “Historic Black Memphians.”  These transcripts were given to the Library by Mrs. Lewis during her lifetime. -- Selma Seligman Lewis grew up in Nashville and earned a bachelor’s degree from Vanderbilt University.  In 1942, Selma and her husband, civic volunteer and businessman, James Marshall Lewis, moved to Memphis, where they reared three children.  Lewis went on to earn a Master’s and PhD. in American History from the University of Memphis. -- After years of working to raise public awareness of social issues, Lewis became the first female president of Jewish Family Services in 1962.  She served as a Vista volunteer for the Metropolitan Inter-Faith Association (MIFA) and a coordinator of the Memphis Coalition for the Homeless in 1972.  Mrs. Lewis also worked with Myra Dreifus and others in Memphis to organize the Fund for Needy School Children, which she chaired from 
1972-1974.  This program helped to provide free or reduced cost lunches for many area school children. -- Mrs. Lewis served on the board of numerous organizations, including the Memphis College of Art, the Memphis Literacy Council, the Mental Health Society of Memphis and Shelby County, Theatre Memphis, and Facing History and Ourselves.  She was president of the Jewish Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South and in 1993, she received the Women of Achievement Steadfastness Award. -- Selma Lewis died in an automobile accident in March 2000.  She was mourned by family and her many friends who described her as a courageous woman who made the city a better place.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Adele Litty Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B4</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Adele Litty was one of two daughters born to Harry H. Litty and his wife, Elizabeth Clarke Litty.  Harry H. Litty served as the mayor of Memphis from 1917 to 1918.  Adele was unmarried and rather shy, compared to her sister, Marion.  Jimmy Blakely, a family friend, told The Commercial Appeal in an article after Adele’s death that Marion “was a socialite who could dance and all of that, but Adele never did as far as I know.”  Adele lived in the family home on South Willett Street until her death on June 2, 1998.  She bequeathed $9.5 million to the King’s Daughters and Sons Nursing Home, formerly known as the Home for Incurables, located at 1467 E. McLemore.  A portion of the money Adele donated went towards the construction of a new home at 3568 Appling Road in Bartlett, TN. -- Michael Hartsfield, Adele’s attorney, donated this collection to the Memphis Public Library in 2006.  The collection includes large amounts of correspondence from Adele’s male friends to her, mostly dating from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s.  Besides this, it also includes documents relating to her father’s term as mayor as well as important family documents such as marriage certificates, deeds, letters, invitations, poetry likely written by her father, and even Mr. Litty’s Last Will and Testament. -- Also included in the collection is a large amount of Litty family photographs split into two albums.  Many of the photographs were unable to be identified, but some of them were either already labeled or labels were added based on the envelopes they were found in or on connections made by looking at other photographs.  This collection provides valuable information on a prominent Memphis family and one of its daughters, her lifestyle, and the climate of the era she lived in.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Harry H. Litty Family Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J22</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Harry H. Litty was born in 1862 in Toledo, Ohio.  After attending North Kentucky College, he began his business career with the Toledo, Cincinnati, and St. Louis Railroad.  His work with the railroad brought him to Memphis, where he was an engineer with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.  Litty also worked with the Rogers and Ballentine Company, a major railroad construction company, which built rail lines throughout the South. -- While Litty worked for Rogers and Ballentine, the company was awarded the contract to build the Great Bridge at Memphis (later known as the Frisco Bridge).  Construction began in 1888 and the bridge opened with a great public celebration on May 12, 1892, when some 50,000 people gathered on the river bluffs to watch a string of 19 locomotives cross the bridge.  As a former railroad engineer, Litty had the honor of driving the first train across the bridge. -- Litty next began to study law under Colonel G.A.C. Holt, and in 1890, he was admitted to the bar.  As a result of his legal training, Litty received an appointment to serve as a collector for the Internal Revenue Service during the Cleveland administration.  He also served as a member of the City Board of Public Works from 1896-1900 and was selected to head the City Club of Memphis, which was founded in 1908.  From 1917 to 1918, he served a term as mayor of Memphis (mayoral terms were two years at that time).  Many of Litty’s activities as mayor were directed toward supporting America’s efforts to win World War I. -- In 1922 Litty donated land for a park in the Glenview neighborhood.  The neighborhood honored Litty by naming the park after him, and each August the people of Glenview celebrated “Litty Day” in his honor.  One of Litty’s favorite pastimes was to walk through the park and watch children play. -- Litty pursued a wide range of interests, including fishing and big game hunting.  He also had a large collection of books and especially enjoyed poetry.  He combined his enthusiasm for the outdoors and his love of poetry in a humorous poem entitled “Hatchie Coon,” the name of his fishing club in Arkansas. -- The Harry H. Litty Family Collection was given to the library in 1997 by Michael Hartsfield, attorney for Harry Litty’s daughter, Adele Litty, who died in 1998.  The collection includes three scrapbooks, two of which contain information about World War I.  The third scrapbook has clippings which focus on Harry Litty’s activities while mayor of Memphis.  Also in the collection are various newspaper articles and a large number of family photographs, as well as material on the Glenview neighborhood and the creation of Litty Park. -- Much of the material in the collection relates to World War I, and the names of Memphians who were killed in combat have been excerpted from the scrapbooks and placed in an alphabetical listing in the finding aid to the collection.  The scrapbooks also include a number of newspaper photographs and biographical profiles of men in the military, and the names of those who were profiled have also been put in an alphabetical list.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Papers of Henry Loeb, III</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G-98</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Henry Loeb, III was born into a wealthy and prominent family in Memphis in 1920.  After graduating from Brown University and serving as a Naval lieutenant World War II, he returned to civilian life in Memphis.  As Secretary of Loeb’s Laundry-Cleaners, he became prominent within the business community, and in 1950 he was appointed to the prestigious Park Commission. -- Initially, Loeb had the support of E.H. Crump and his colleagues, who had dominated politics in Memphis for nearly a half century.  However, he became an enemy of the Crump machine through his criticism of Park Commission expenditures and his defeat in 1952 of a Crump-backed candidate for a post in the American Legion.  Crump died in 1954, leaving a political vacuum.  Loeb ran successfully for a seat on the City Commission in 1955 and was on his way to becoming the most influential political figure in West Tennessee in the post-Crump era. -- When health problems forced incumbent Edmund Orgill out of the 1959 race, Loeb easily defeated the other candidates and was elected mayor.  During his term, the city public facilities were desegregated peacefully, before federal legislation mandated such changes.  Despite Loeb having worked with the city’s bi-racial committee to implement integration, he became increasingly viewed as a segregationist. -- In October 1963 Loeb ended his campaign for re-election and resigned as mayor.  The death of the president of his family’s laundry business left the enterprise without a leader and Henry felt obliged to take over.  He became president of the company in 1964, yet disagreements with family members led him to sell his interest in the company in 1967 and begin planning his re-entry into politics.  Loeb defeated the incumbent Mayor Ingram in 1967 in a campaign which had strong racial overtones and established a highly-charged, racially-polarized climate in Memphis for the next four years. -- Loeb’s second term as mayor was among the most significant periods in Memphis history.  Municipal employees in Memphis unionized as the nationwide struggle for African American civil rights gained momentum.  Martin Luther King, Jr., came to Memphis to support sanitation workers who were on strike, and was assassinated on April 4, 1968.  The sanitation workers’ strike was settled soon after Dr. King’s tragic death, however, the city remained divided, and Loeb’s effectiveness and political strength were weakened. -- Near the end of his second term, Loeb decided not to seek re-election.  At the urging of his wife he left office, but he virtually named his successor and remained active in public affairs for several years.  He taught briefly at Christian Brothers College and seriously considered running for Governor of Tennessee before moving to Forrest City, Arkansas to run a farm and agricultural equipment business. -- Loeb’s papers include a very large number of letters related to his political career, his personal life and the Loeb family business.  The correspondence from his terms in city government shows the workings of its various divisions and departments, his influence over policy, and his fantastic attention to detail.  The papers also indicate Loeb’s high level of involvement in regional, state and national affairs.  The letters reflect the significant social change which took place during Loeb’s years of public service, and address numerous issues such as housing and renewal projects, school desegregation, labor relations, annexation and the city budget.  The collection also includes scrapbooks maintained by Loeb which contain primarily newspaper clippings.  The articles cover local, state and national issues and events which shaped the city of Memphis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Reverend Louis Sandford Schuyler Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S30 (Part of Yellow Fever)</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Louis Sandford Schuyler, son of the Reverend Montgomery Schuyler and Lydia E. Schuyler, was born in Buffalo, New York in 1852.  A serious, scholarly young man, he followed his father into the Episcopal priesthood.  He served at a number of churches in New York before he was assigned to the Church of the Holy Innocents in Hoboken, New Jersey.  The Reverend Charles Carroll Parsons, who went on to become Rector of St. Lazarus-Grace Episcopal Church in Memphis, also served at the Church of the Holy Innocents prior to Reverend Schuyler. -- Father Schuyler decided to follow Reverend Parsons to Memphis to be of assistance when the city was hit by a devastating yellow fever epidemic in 1878.  He arrived the day after Father Parsons’ death from yellow fever on September 6, 1878.  Louis Schuyler died of yellow fever on September 17, 1878. -- This small collection includes correspondence, a photograph of Schuyler and a book, Memorial of Louis Sandford Schuyler, Priest, which provides a detailed account of his life and work.  The collection is stored in the Memphis and Shelby County Room with several small collections related to the yellow fever epidemics in Memphis, including The Reverend Charles Carroll Parsons Collection and A History of Yellow Fever in Memphis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Ruth F. Loewenberg Shelby Farms Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Ruth Friedman Loewenberg grew up in Washington, D.C. and attended George Washington University.  While in Memphis visiting her sister, she met William A. Loewenberg, and she described their meeting as “love at first sight.”  They later married and had two daughters, Joanne Loewenberg Markell and Freddie Loewenberg Felt, and a son, William Ira Loewenberg. -- Ruth Loewenberg said, “I’m a joiner.  I have learned, like my husband, not to say no.”  The Loewenbergs’ joint philanthropic and humanitarian efforts were recognized through numerous awards, and Mrs. Loewenberg was honored individually by various organizations for her special contributions to social agencies such as Family Link, the Pink Ladies volunteers at St. Francis Hospital, and the Riverview-Kansas Day Care Center.  Her extensive community service included taking an active role in many organizations such as the Sisterhood of Temple Israel, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities, the Beethoven Club, Hadassah, and the Ladies of St. Jude.  Loewenberg served as president of Neighborhood House, and sat on its board for 35 years.  She was also instrumental in the founding of Runaway House and contributed to the development of Dogwood Village, a residential facility for emotionally disturbed children.  With her husband, William, she helped establish the Loewenberg School of Nursing at the University of Memphis. -- Ruth Loewenberg’s dedication and commitment in the fight to save the Shelby County Penal Farm from private development in the 1970s as a member of the Shelby Farms Planning Board was an outstanding achievement.  The Ruth F. Loewenberg Shelby Farms Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Ruth Loewenberg in 1980.  The material in the collection is primarily from the years 1973 to 1976.  The earliest material relates to the Rouse-Boyle proposal which would have resulted in private development of the Shelby County Penal Farm.  This proposal was soundly rejected by community leaders in 1973.  Subsequently, a $50,000 grant from Abe Plough, matched by the city of Memphis and Shelby County, was used to finance a study, which resulted in the creation of the Shelby Farms Planning Board. -- While the bulk of the correspondence in the collection centers on the selection of a planner, the planning process itself, and communication between the principal participants, it also includes government documents, municipal department and committee responses, reports on public meetings and subcommittee activities, and the final comprehensive proposal.  The collection provides an important source of information on the interaction of citizens and government in community planning and social change.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Robert F. Looney Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Robert Fain Looney was a descendant of a Virginia family who pioneered in Tennessee.  His great grandfather distinguished himself in the Revolutionary War, and both of his grandfathers were members of the convention that drew up Tennessee’s first constitution.  A native of Maury County, Tennessee, Looney was born in August 1824.  After attending Jackson College in Columbia, he studied law with his brother-in-law, Judge Edmund Dillahunty, and practiced law in Maury County before moving to Memphis. -- Although Looney was a Whig and opposed secession, he formed the 38th Tennessee Regiment when the Civil War began.  Under his command, the regiment won distinction at battles at Shiloh, Perryville and Murfreesboro, and served with honor in numerous other battles in Tennessee and Georgia.  At Shiloh, Looney led a charge that took at least 1,000 prisoners, including General Benjamin M. Prentiss.  Looney himself was later taken prisoner, but was exchanged.  Returning to active duty for the duration of the war, he surrendered at Oxford, Mississippi in 1865. -- Following the war Looney returned to his law practice for five years before turning his attention to business and financial matters.  He was active throughout the rest of his life on behalf of the Democratic Party, and was appointed as one of the commissioners responsible for the Shiloh battlefield being designated a national military park. -- Looney was married to Louisa Crofford of Maury County in 1847, and was the father of three sons and five daughters.  His children continued in the family tradition and distinguished themselves in the political and civic life of Memphis and Tennessee.  Looney died in November 1899 and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. -- The Robert F. Looney Collection was donated to the library by Dr. Simon R. Breusch as part of The Monte Cooper Collection.  Perhaps the most interesting items in this collection are those from Looney’s military career, which detail his distinguished record in battle and his conflict with Confederate leaders as he attempted to gain permission to raise a brigade in west Tennessee. -- In addition to the extensive materials relating to Looney’s military service, the collection includes a small number of documents having to do with his life before the war and numerous letters between Looney and members of his family.  The papers also include correspondence having to do with the creation of Shiloh National Military Park. -- The Looney papers, which describe the life of an active political figure of Tennessee and his role as a military leader and Southern patriot during and after the Civil War, are an extremely valuable part of the Memphis and Shelby County Room holdings.  The papers provide researchers with a better understanding of life in the South during a dramatic and critical period of United States history.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Mary Graham Love Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Mary Graham Love was born July 27, 1884.  She was the daughter of Memphis Mayor George Collins Love, who held office from November 1915 to February 1916, and Mary A. Graham Love.  Mary Graham Love graduated from St. Mary’s Episcopal School for Girls and she and her family were active members of the Calvary Episcopal Church.  Mary was active in various church organizations and served as president of the Women’s Auxiliary of the Diocese of Tennessee from 1937 to 1939. -- Love also served the community through her leadership in the Girl Scouts of America and the Women’s Department of the Tri-State Fair Association, where she served as chair for three years.  She was active in the Nineteenth Century Club, where she served a one-year term as president, and she served a two-year term as president of the Eleventh district of the Tennessee Federation of Women’s Clubs.  She further demonstrated her civic interests when she donated the Love family home, along with five other houses, to the city of Memphis to encourage the redevelopment of the Greenlaw neighborhood, one of the city’s oldest residential areas. -- The Mary Graham Love Papers were given to the library by an anonymous donor.  The collection includes letters written to Mary Love and her sister Octavia, as well as correspondence written to their mother.  Also included are photographs, newspaper clippings, a scrapbook on the Tri-State Fair, and other miscellaneous pieces.  The collection also includes information about Mayor Love and other members of the Love family.</dc:description>

<dc:title>John William McAfee Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K23</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>John William “Bill” McAfee, Sr. was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1915.  His family moved to Memphis when he was quite young and settled in the South Memphis area.  McAfee dropped out of Southside High School and became a film projectionist, working with his father screening films at local movie houses.  His early work with film would set him on a unique and lengthy career path as a newsreel cameraman and photojournalist. -- In 1944, McAfee was drafted into the U.S. Navy.  His duties while he was stationed in the South Pacific included photographing Japanese military installations and the atomic bombing of Japan.  After World War II, McAfee returned to Memphis, where he worked as a freelance newsreel photographer for major press and media networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC and UPI.  He covered some of the most dramatic events of the post-war period, including the rise of Elvis Presley and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  McAfee’s work during the tumultuous years of the Civil Rights Movement included covering Freedom Marches and the enrollment at Ole Miss of James Meredith, the first African American to attend the University.  McAfee’s also served as chair of motion picture photography for the Memphis Cotton Carnival Association during its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. -- McAfee’s work with the motion picture industry included screening films for the Memphis Board of Censors headed by the infamous Lloyd T. Binford.  McAfee noted that a “Banned in Memphis” label ensured higher box office sales in other cities.  He continued work as a film projectionist at the Main Street motion picture houses in Memphis, and he ran the projector when the last picture was screened at Lowe’s State theater in 1969. -- Toward the end of his career, McAfee worked as a cameraman on major motion pictures including The People vs. Larry Flynt and The Firm, both filmed in Memphis.  After retirement, McAfee was owner-operator of Mid-Town Photo Service and Mid-South Theatrical Motion and Photo Supply Company. -- The photographs and papers in The John William McAfee Collection were given to the Library by his daughter, Rose McAfee Phillips.  The material in the collection documents McAfee’s active career as a newsreel photographer, as well as his work with motion pictures and other forms of photography. -- While this collection does not include film footage, copies of detailed notes and headlines McAfee provided for each frame shot document the significant events he covered.  McAfee’s work required a great deal of travel, and among the material in this collection are expense reports and weekly logs of his locations and subjects filmed. -- Some of the material reflects McAfee’s work as cameraman or projectionist on motion pictures such as Intruder in the Dust, filmed in Oxford (1949) and based on William Faulkner’s novel of the same name and A Family Thing (1995), The People vs. Larry Flint (1995) and The Firm (1992) which were filmed in Memphis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Personal Papers of Judge Walter Malone</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Walter Malone served as Circuit Court Judge for the last twenty years of his life, but he was best known as an accomplished poet and writer.  His personal papers were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by his niece, Alba R. Malone.  The papers consist primarily of correspondence and handwritten and typed drafts of Judge Malone’s literary works.  Much of the correspondence was exchanged with someone Malone addressed as “My Dear Friend,” who is presumed to be a fellow poet whose last name was Van Troppen.  The collection also includes a few business papers and documents. -- Born in DeSoto County in 1866, Malone was the youngest of twelve children.  He showed early promise as a writer and sold his first poem for publication at the age of twelve and had his first book of poetry published when he was sixteen.  At the University of Mississippi he was editor-in-chief and a frequent contributor to the college magazine. -- For several years he worked in New York City as a writer for magazines and weekly newspapers.  He corresponded with literary figures from New York about poetry, plays and short stories once he returned to Memphis.  Before becoming a judge, Malone served as a lawyer and as city editor of the Memphis Public Ledger. -- Malone’s most famous poem, “Opportunity,” was written in 1904, the year before he was appointed judge.  Although there are several stories concerning the circumstances under which it was written, there is a consensus  that it was a reply to the pessimistic theme expressed in a similarly-named poem by former Senator John J. Ingalls of Kansas.  Malone was paid $10 for the poem by the publishers of Munsey’s Magazine, who did not print it for several months.  “Opportunity” was eventually translated into several languages and many readers stated that the poem is so uplifting and inspiring that it prevented them from committing suicide.  Although “Opportunity” was Malone’s best-known poem, he considered his epic poem “DeSoto” to be his most important work. -- Walter Malone died in 1915, and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery.  His epitaph was one which he wrote himself: 
&quot;Stranger who passeth by my low house of clay,
Pause for a moment in a tender mood:
Think not your sigh of pity thrown away,
Because I’d say 'God bless you' if I could.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:title>John D. Martin Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K23-K30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>John Donelson Martin was born in Memphis in 1883, the son of John and Mary Walker Hull Martin.  He attended Memphis University School, where he was a football player and editor of the school newspaper.  He received a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1905 and established a law practice in Memphis, where he became active in politics as an associate of E.H. Crump.  He was appointed District Judge for the Western Tennessee Federal Court in 1935 and quickly established a reputation as a “no nonsense” judge, working hard to reduce the backlog of cases in federal courts.  Many of Judge Martin’s vacations were spent hearing cases for other circuits throughout the country.  In 1940, Martin was selected as an appellate judge for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a position he held until his death in 1962. -- The John D. Martin Collection, which includes over 26,000 items, provides valuable information on the history of Memphis, Western Tennessee, and the federal court system.  The documents in the collection from the early part of Judge Martin’s career, describe his involvement in World War I, as well as his political activities on behalf of the Crump machine.  Materials from the period 1935 to 1940, his early years as a federal judge, relate to the business of the Western Tennessee District Federal Court and Martin’s interaction with other judges in Tennessee, particularly Judge John Gore of Jackson.  Papers from the period after 1940 have a national scope and address the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Martin’s work in other circuits throughout the nation. -- The collection includes case documents, court summary reports, docket calendars, newspaper articles, photographs and papers related to court business.  The papers also provide a glimpse into Judge Martin’s personal life through letters and documents relating to his serving as president of the Southern Baseball Association, a position he held from 1919 to 1938. -- The provenance of the collection is unknown.  There are no records showing when this collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room or naming the donor.  From its appearance in the original boxes, it could be gathered that the collection is comprised of the contents of the file cabinets in Judge Martin’s chambers after his death.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Thomas E. Maxson Collection: A Career in Public Engineering</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R29</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Thomas E. Maxson was born in LaBette County, Kansas in 1901 and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas.  He graduated from Texas A&amp;M College in 1922 with a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering.  After receiving his degree, Maxson worked for a year with the Texas Highway Department and a year with the Frisco Railway in Birmingham before moving to Memphis. -- In July 1924 Maxson began working in the city engineering department in Memphis as a draftsman.  While working as a city engineer Maxson wrote the Report on Flood Control: Memphis, Tennessee, February 1937, an analysis of the devastating effects of the 1937 flood, in which he recommended measures to protect the city in the event of another flood.  Maxson’s flood control plan identified three problem areas: the North Memphis Wolf River basin, the South Memphis Nonconnah Creek Basin and the Gayoso Basin.  The plan was authorized as part of the Flood Control Act, which was approved by Congress in 1937.  As a result of Maxson’s assessment, new levees, floodwalls, drainage structures and bank protection projects were constructed to withstand a fifty five foot flood. -- In 1962 Maxson was appointed City Engineer, and in 1973 he became Director of Public Works.  In addition, he served as a consultant for the Memphis Port and Harbor Commission and as a member of the Memphis and Shelby County Planning Commission and the Riverfront Harbor Commission.  Nearly 500 miles of city streets were planned and constructed under his guidance. -- The American Public Works Association’s Samuel Greeley Award was presented to Maxson in 1956 for his 30 years of continuous service to one city.  At a national presentation in 1966, the American Public Works Association and Kiwanis International named Maxson one of the Top Ten Public Works Men-of-the-Year.  He was also named 1966 Engineer of the Year by the Memphis Society of Professional Engineers and 1970 Engineer of the Year by the Memphis Joint Engineering Societies.  Maxson received a singular honor in 1971 when the city’s multi-million dollar South Sewage Plant was named in his honor. -- Aside from his professional work in engineering, Maxson was an active member of Lindenwood Christian Church and participated in numerous civic organizations including the Civitan Club, the Gavel Club, the Masons and the Shriners.  Maxson retired in 1972, some 48 years after beginning work with the city of Memphis.  He died in 1984 at the age of 83, leaving his wife, Marian Maxson. -- Material in the Maxson collection provides an unusually complete account of the career of a professional engineer.  The material includes letters, photographs, newspaper clippings, awards and a large quantity of slides and 8mm film detailing many public projects.  In addition to the items pertaining to Maxson’s career as an engineer, the collection includes articles on his civic activities and church membership.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Florence McIntyre Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G10-G11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Florence Makin McIntyre is remembered as the First Lady of Memphis Art.  She was born in Memphis in 1878 and grew up in her family home, the Pillow-McIntyre House, at 707 Adams Avenue in the historic Victorian Village neighborhood.  As a child she attended the Clara Conway Institute, an early Memphis girls’ school, where her interest in art was encouraged.  She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago under John H. Vanderpool, one of America’s most noted drawing teachers.  She continued her studies in Philadelphia, where she worked under Marguerita Archambault, studying portraiture and miniature painting.  McIntyre also spent several summers at the Woodstock School of Landscape Painting in Woodstock, New York, where she met many important fellow artists. -- Shortly after returning to Memphis in 1914, McIntyre and members of the Nineteenth Century Club organized the Memphis Art Association which promoted the serious study of art and brought exhibitions and lectures to Memphis. -- McIntyre became the first director of the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery when it opened in 1916 and held that position for six years.  She mounted several outstanding exhibits during her tenure at Brooks, including Lithographs of the War Work of England and America in 1917 and an exhibit of war portraits which now reside at the National Portrait Gallery which was displayed in 1922.  She resigned from Brooks in 1922 and returned to her work with the Memphis Art Association. -- In 1921 McIntyre was instrumental in organizing the Southern States Art League.  She served as the organization’s first president, drawing up its constitution and by-laws.  During her first few years with the League, she mounted two successful exhibits of work by Southern artists. -- In 1925, under the guidance of McIntyre and her friend and art patron, Rosa Lee, the Memphis Art Association founded the James Lee Memorial Academy of Arts.  McIntyre served as the director of the Academy until 1936, when a split occurred between the board of the Memphis Art Association and the staff of the school.  The James Lee Academy continued to offer classes, and in 1942, the school moved to the McIntyre home at 707 Adams Avenue.  The school, which was then named the Free Art School of the Memphis Art Association, offered free art classes and continued to run until shortly after McIntyre’s death in 1963.  The 1936 split also resulted in the formation of a new art school, the Memphis Academy of Arts, which changed its name to Memphis College of Art in 1985. -- Throughout her career, McIntyre published numerous articles and papers in local and national publications.  In 1952, McIntyre published her autobiography titled Art and Life.  The book covers the history of art in Memphis, McIntyre’s long career with various local and national art organizations and her philosophy on art education. -- The Florence McIntyre Collection includes material on McIntyre’s work with the Memphis Art Association, Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, the James Lee Academy and the Southern States Art League.  The papers also contain McIntyre’s correspondence with American art directors and artists, particularly American lithographer Joseph Pennell, whose work she supported.  Material related to the publication of McIntyre’s book Art and Life is included in the collection.  In addition, there are lectures and notes by McIntyre on art education and the history of art in Memphis.  Finally, the collection contains personal papers such as postcards, photographs, awards and newspaper clippings on art and other subjects of interest to McIntyre and information on the residences she owned in Victorian Village.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Ethel Taylor Maxwell Collection: A Life in Music and the Arts</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G30-G31</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Ethel Taylor Maxwell was born in Memphis in 1915 and enjoyed a long and prominent career as a musical singing star and later as a teacher of music.  She credited her parents with encouraging her early interest in music and supporting her artistic ambition.  Ethel began piano lessons at age 4 and continued the study of instrumental music through college.  Later, she began studies in voice and drama. -- Ethel graduated from the Hutchison School in 1932 and went on to pursue a degree from Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College).  She earned a degree in piano in 1934 and received her B.A. degree in psychology and education in 1936.  She then moved to New York to continue her music studies.  While living there from 1936 to 1940, she attended the Alvine School of Speech and Drama and the Rossini Opera School and studied voice with Estelle Liebling and Arthur Wrege. -- Taylor’s career was officially launched in Memphis in 1937 when she starred in the Memphis Open Air Theater production of Sigmund Romberg’s operetta The Desert Song.  For the next thirteen years, Taylor was the leading lady in the theater’s summer productions of such enormously popular works as Vagabond King, The Merry Widow and Student Prince. -- In 1942, Ethel Taylor and Early Hobson Maxwell were married in a much publicized ceremony at Idlewild Presbyterian Church.  Early was a sports editor for the Evening Appeal in the early 1930s and was later made promotions editor of the Commercial Appeal.  The couple had two daughters, Ethel Taylor Maxwell and Margaret Alice “Peggy” Maxwell. -- During World War II, Maxwell served in the U.S. Army at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.  While Maxwell was in the military, Ethel performed with the Memphis Open Air Theater and the Chattanooga Opera Association while continuing her voice studies at the University of Chattanooga’s Czadic Conservatory. -- At the end of the war, Early returned to civilian life and formed his own public relations firm, Early Maxwell Associates.  Ethel continued her singing career, and in 1952, she joined the faculty of Memphis State College as a teacher of voice.  In 1956, she received a Master of Arts in speech and drama, and later that year joined the faculty of Lausanne School for Girls as a music instructor. -- In 1970 Ethel Maxwell became an assistant professor in the Department of Music at Memphis State University, receiving tenure in 1973.  She continued her teaching at the university until her retirement in 1987. -- In addition to her success as a professional singer, Ethel served as a soloist for many years at Calvary Episcopal Church, and as organist-choirmaster at St. Elisabeth’s Episcopal.  She was also an active participant in service organizations and served as President of the Beethoven Club for several years. -- The Ethel Taylor Maxwell Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Ethel Maxwell in 1991.  The collection contains photographs and newspaper clippings, as well as scrapbooks and programs which describe Taylor’s professional career as a musical star in Memphis and Chattanooga.  Also included are personal and family items such as memorabilia from her college years and an album of wedding photographs.  In addition to the material which describes Maxwell’s musical career, the collection contains information on her teaching positions at the Memphis State University and Lausanne School for Girls.  Finally, the collection includes clippings on Taylor’s husband, Early Maxwell and his public relations firm, Early Maxwell Associates, which brought many well-known performers to Memphis, including Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and golfing great Ben Hogan.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphians During War</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N1</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Memphians During War collection consists primarily of materials relating to the involvement of Memphians in the Civil War, World War I and World War II. -- The material on the Civil War largely relates to events which took place in Memphis and nearby areas.  Included are news clippings, mostly from Union papers, which cover the action near Memphis at Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River and describe the gunboat battle on the river at Memphis.  The collection also includes a composite photograph of Union officers stationed in Memphis during the occupation of the city, a copy of the Union gunboat commander’s demand to the mayor for the surrender of the city and the mayor’s reply.  The personal letters of Confederate soldier Robert Bond are included, as are numerous letters from William Augustus Jones to his family in Holly Springs, Mississippi, about his involvement in the war.  Official documents and correspondence from L.D. McKissick, Civil Governor and Provost Marshal of Memphis are contained in the collection, as is the notebook of J.S. White, a surgeon in the Confederate Army.  Among a variety of other items in the collection are an original telegram sent to Memphis with news of the First Battle of Manassas, forms used by former Confederates swearing allegiance to the Union and the request of a Union soldier for replacement of equipment lost during the Battle of Shiloh. -- The World War I collection consists of a large number of posters which were used as propaganda and as reminders to the public to support the war effort.  The posters urge Americans to subscribe to the various Liberty Loan drives, plant Victory Gardens, and refrain from eating certain food items so that U.S. troops and our allies would have enough food.  Various posters representing organizations such as the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic War Council, Jewish Welfare Board, Salvation Army and Red Cross are included.  The variety of posters presents fascinating examples of the subtle efforts used to encourage the public to support the war.  Items related to World War I also include two volumes of the army newspaper, Stars and Stripes. -- The material related to World War II also includes numerous posters.  The messages in the posters produced during World War II are more direct than those of World War I, and contain commands for Americans such as “Buy War Bonds.”  Many of the World War II posters contain an historic appeal to patriotism and compare the current American efforts for freedom to those of the Revolutionary War.  Photography began to be used as a medium to record images during World War II, and the collection contains many photographs of war scenes.  Also included are a collection of plane identification flash cards, slides of silhouettes of planes, ration cards and V-Mail letters.  Letters from both world wars are also included, such as those from World War I pilot Louis L. Carruthers of Memphis and newsy, chatty letters from two Felts brothers written during World War II.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Auditorium Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B6</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Auditorium Programs Collection was assembled from items collected by the Memphis Public Library and donated by individuals over many years.  The collection consists of booklets, concert programs, pamphlets and playbills which chronicle events held at the Memphis and Shelby County Auditorium between the years of 1924 and 1975.

Built on the former site of the Shelby County Court House, the Auditorium was dedicated in October 1924 with a concert by John Phillip Sousa.  On June 2, 1930, it was renamed Ellis Auditorium in honor of Robert R. Ellis who had played and instrumental role in establishing the building.  In July 1958, Ellis Auditorium was renovated to include the North and South Halls which expanded the space available for performances.  The North Hall was renamed Dixon-Meyers Hall in recognition of the support Hugo Dixon and I. L. “Ike” Meyers gave to Memphis musical arts.  In 1981, the South Hall was named in honor of Vincent De Frank, founder and conductor emeritus of the Memphis Symphony Orchestra.  Ellis Auditorium remained in operation until 1996 when it was closed to make way for the expansion of the Cook Convention Center.  On November 19, 1996, Bruce Springsteen performed the final concert in Ellis Auditorium.

In addition to John Phillip Sousa and Bruce Springsteen, many other celebrated entertainers of the 20th century performed at the Auditorium.  The included: Paul Whiteman, W. C. Handy, Will Rogers, Isadora Duncan, Ethel Barrymore, Rudy Vallee, Fanny Brice, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Tallulah Bankhead, Katharine Hepburn, Liberace, and Lawrence Welk.  Researchers interested in the history of performance in Memphis will also want to consult the Memphis Open Air Theatre Collection and the Theatre Memphis Programs Collection, also housed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Senator Kenneth Douglas McKellar: A Register of His Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G-98</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Kenneth McKellar was born in 1869 near Richmond, Alabama.  In 1892, after receiving a Bachelor’s, Master’s and law degree from the University of Alabama, he moved to Memphis.  He began his extensive political career when he was selected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1908.  He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1911 to 1917, and on March 4, 1917, he took his seat as the first directly elected United States Senator from Tennessee.  McKellar served in the Senate continuously from 1917 until he was defeated for reelection by Albert Gore, Sr. in 1953.  He then returned to Memphis, where he lived until his death in October 1957. -- McKellar held various important posts during his career as a legislator.  As a member of the Military Affairs Committee, he was instrumental in reorganizing the U.S. Army around the time of World War I.  As a member and chair of the Post Offices and Post Roads Committee, he played a key part in early legislation which established the United States Air Mail Service.  McKellar worked for many years on legislation on flood control projects on the Tennessee River, which later provided a basis for the Tennessee Valley Authority.  During the first administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, McKellar served as a spokesman for the Democratic Party, and made a number of nationwide radio addresses in defense of the Roosevelt administration. -- McKellar’s authority and influence continued to increase through the 1930s.  In 1937, during the prolonged illness of Senator Carter Glass of Virginia, he became acting chair of the Appropriations Committee.  When President Roosevelt died in 1945, he became president de facto of the Senate and, by invitation from President Truman, occupied the Vice President’s place in Cabinet sessions. -- Throughout his years of public life McKellar gained a reputation for never having thrown away a scrap of paper.  Consequently, he left a large collection of papers and mementos.  Senator McKellar’s papers were given to the library in 1960 by his family.  The collection, which is one of the largest in the Memphis and Shelby County Room, includes numerous letters and a large series of scrapbooks.  About half the letters in the collection were exchanged between McKellar and his constituents on a variety of subjects.  Special series within the collection contain materials of a more specific nature including correspondence between McKellar and E.H. Crump, and correspondence dealing with post office and rural routs, military affairs, legislation, politics, war priorities, appropriations, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and New Deal bureaus.  The scrapbooks, which date from 1889 to 1951, contain clippings on McKellar’s activities in local and national politics, as well as items from his personal life. -- Although McKellar was primarily concerned with the welfare of Tennessee and Tennesseans throughout his career, the usefulness of the collection is not limited to those studying Tennessee history.  Rather, McKellar’s involvement in many national issues makes this collection valuable to those researching American political history from World War I thru the Depression, New Deal and World War II. -- The collection may be used in conjunction with A McKellar Calendar of Speeches, 1928-1940, a doctoral dissertation by Joseph Riggs, which includes a thorough index and summaries of many of McKellar’s speeches.</dc:description>

<dc:title>George Mahan, Jr. Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J12</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>George Mahan, Jr., distinguished and revered architect, was born in Memphis and spent his entire life in the city.  He began his career at the age of fifteen, when he joined the architectural firm of Shaw and Pfeil as a student draftsman.  Mahan’s architectural style was greatly influenced by his experience at Shaw and Pfeil.  Mr. Shaw taught Mahan that if he drew a cow, he should make it look like a cow; and if he built a church, he should make it look like a church.  Mahan followed this maxim throughout his career. -- Recognized as the dean of Memphis architects, Mahan designed or assisted in designing numerous schools, banks and other public buildings, including the Memphis Cotton Exchange and the King Cotton Hotel.  In 1913 he co-founded the Memphis Architects’ League, which was to become the Memphis chapter of the American Institute of Architects. -- During his long and outstanding career, Mahan held partnerships with several noted architects including J.J. Broadwell, Everett Woods and Arnold Shappley, Jr.  Throughout his career, Mahan found time to train many promising students, and some of Memphis’ best-known architects began their work with Mahan as their mentor. -- The George Mahan, Jr. Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1989 by Mr. Mahan’s daughter, Elizabeth Mahan Ballenger.  The collection consists of photographs, newspaper clippings and other memorabilia relating to Mr. Mahan’s career and his founding of the Memphis Architects’ League.  The finding aid to the collection includes an interview with Elizabeth Ballenger completed around the time she donated her father’s papers to the library.  The centerpiece of the collection is a copy of Mr. Mahan’s Commission Book, which is the only comprehensive record of his career.  The Commission Book lists and dates each of the over 1,800 architectural projects Mahan completed from 1912 to 1967.  Unfortunately, many of Mahan’s most important projects have been torn down in the name of progress, and the collection serves as a record of the significance of his work.</dc:description>

<dc:title>William A. Goodman Historic Documents Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R31</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In 1978, William A. Goodman, a Memphis attorney, historian and collector, gave the Library a unique collection of historic documents.  Seven of the pieces are 18th century documents, including two signed by Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, Spanish Governor of the Natchez Territory, along with two signed by John Sevier, first elected Governor of Tennessee.  The older documents of the collection feature items from or signed by General James Wilkinson, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, David Folsom, Matthew Fontaine Maury, and George Peabody. -- The largest group of letters is comprised of 85 pieces from the Civil War.  Most of these are letters, orders, or telegrams issued by Confederate and Union commanders operating in and around Memphis or in strategic areas bordering the Mississippi River.  Included are letters or orders signed by Union Generals Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and Stephen A. Hurlbut and by Confederate Generals G.T. Beauregard, Nathan Bedford Forrest, Joseph E. Johnson, Edwin Kirby-Smith, Gideon J. Pillow, Daniel Ruggles, Alfred J. Vaughan and Joseph Wheeler.  There are also documents bearing the signatures of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. -- A number of the items dated after 1865 are connected to the war in some way, including letters or notes from Jefferson Davis, Nathan Bedford Forrest and General Marcus J. Wright.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Papers of Mrs. Anna E. Gilbert of Raleigh, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Anna Elizabeth Brooks was born around 1857 to William and Elizabeth Brooks. According to the 1860 census, Anna was the youngest of four siblings. Anna married Andrew C. Gilbert, who died in 1876 at the age of 26. Anna was quite a religious woman, especially after the death of her husband. She was involved with several church organizations, as well as Bethany School, a religious school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which provided physical and spiritual healing for those in need. -- Much of Mrs. Gilbert’s life was spent in Raleigh, Tennessee. While living in Raleigh, Mrs. Gilbert raised a young girl, Loueva Brown, whose parents had been killed. -- The Gilbert papers consist primarily of personal letters dating between 1880 and 1933. Almost all of the correspondence was written either by or to Anna, although a few early documents are signed by her father, William G. Brooks. -- A large portion of the materials contained in the collection are letters which have a distinct religious tone. Also included are several examples of 19th century land deeds and tax receipts. The materials provide a glimpse into the life of an involved, caring and devout woman around the turn of the century.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Goldsmith Department Store Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J19-J21, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Goldsmith Department Store Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by descendants of company founder Jacob Goldsmith. Materials in the collection include family papers, letters, photographs and legal documents, as well as business items such as journals, corporate minutes, ledgers, photographs and newspaper files. Six scrapbooks contain a wealth of information on the company, its officers and employees. Of particular interest is the large number of photographs which document the growth of the original downtown store, the building of the suburban stores and the company’s promotional and civic activities. -- The collection, which describes the founding and growth of a major Memphis-owned-and-operated department store, provides the history of a corporation that has played an important role in the city’s economic development. In addition, there is biographical information on the Goldsmith family as well as the company’s employees, many of whom spent their entire working careers with the organization. The collection also provides information on the founding of the Goldsmith Civic Garden Center, a part of the Memphis Botanic Gardens, one of the leading public gardens in the South. -- Jacob Goldsmith emigrated to the United States in 1867 at age 17 from his home in Hainstadt, Germany. He and his older brother Isaac lived with their uncle Louis Ottenheimer while establishing themselves in Memphis during the years following the Civil War. In 1875, Jacob married his cousin Dora Ottenheimer, and they had three sons and four daughters. -- The Goldsmith brothers founded a retail business on Beale Street in 1870. In 1881 they opened a new store on Main Street. When Isaac died in 1885, Jacob bought his brother’s interest in the business and moved to another location on Main. As a result of the company’s rapid growth, Jacob Goldsmith rented a new building in 1902 which was situated on the southwest corner of Main and Gayoso. This would become the well-known location of Goldsmith’s main store for the next 80 years. Eventually, the firm would own the entire block situated between Main and Front and Gayoso and McCall. -- Recognizing both the growth of the company and the contributions which his sons, who had become involved in the business, were making to its success, Jacob had the firm incorporated in 1904 as J. Goldsmith and Sons. Under the direction of his sons—and then grandsons—Goldsmith’s Department Store continued to prosper and grow in the years after World War II. Keeping pace with the city’s eastward expansion, Goldsmith’s built its first suburban store, Oak Court, at Poplar and Perkins Extended in 1961. Southland Mall, the city’s first mall, was selected as the location for the next suburban store. This was followed by the expansion of the Oak Court store in 1967, the opening of the store in Raleigh Springs Mall in 1971 and the opening of the Hickory Ridge Mall store in 1981. The first store outside Shelby County opened in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1981. -- Over the years, Goldsmith’s introduced innovative services such as the “charga-plate,” escalators, in-store dining facilities, the latest in retail merchandising and modern suburban stores, which, with progressive family management, made Goldsmith’s one of the leading department stores in the South. -- In 1959, Goldsmith’s became affiliated with the Federated Department Stores, Inc., the largest retail group in the United States. Members of the Goldsmith family remained active in management until the retirement of Robert Goldsmith, the last family member associated with the business.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Colton Greene Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B26-B27</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>A leading citizen of Memphis in the decades after the Civil War, Colton Greene is best remembered as the originator of the Memphis Mardi Gras. Little is known of Greene’s early life other than that he was born in South Carolina in 1832. Greene was living in St. Louis when he enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1861 and took part in an unsuccessful effort to seize the U.S. Arsenal in that city. He served as commander of the 3rd Missouri Cavalry Brigade throughout the war, taking part in many battles in the Trans-Mississippi Military District. -- After the war Greene began a successful career in the insurance business. He was employed by the Memphis branch of the Knickerbocker Life Insurance Company of New York and established his own firm, Greene &amp; Lucas, in 1871. He also founded and served as the first president of the State Savings Bank and helped organize the Tennessee Club. Greene provided enlightened leadership during the difficult years of growing debt and devastation which followed several yellow fever epidemics that forced the city to surrender its charter in 1879. Along with other concerned citizens including Elias Lowenstein and John Overton, Jr., he served on a Water Committee which was formed to investigate the feasibility of constructing a municipal water works. -- When the Memphis newspaper, The Appeal, called for a public discussion of ideas to attract business to the community, Greene proposed that the city celebrate Mardi Gras and established the Mystic Society of Memphi to promote the social events of the festival. The “Mystic Memphi” organized the grand parades, supervised the construction of floats and the design of costumes and sponsored an exclusive ball for its members. With the help of others, notably David P. Hadden, Greene persuaded railroad companies to lower fares during the celebrations and hired fashionable artists and costumers to decorate the city for Mardi Gras. The first festival was held in 1872, and the Memphis celebrations rivaled those of New Orleans and Mobile in magnificence throughout the 1870s. From the 1880s until the turn of the century, the tradition continued, but on a diminished scale. -- A world traveler and a highly educated man, Greene was an avid collector of books. His bequest of more than 500 titles to the Cossitt Library upon his death in 1900 included a large selection of classics as well as many of the latest works on history, science and philosophy. -- The Colton Green Collection consists primarily of correspondence related to Green’s military service during the Civil War and records of the Society of Memphi. The military correspondence includes hand-drawn maps of some of the areas in the Trans-Mississippi Military District where Greene took part in military actions and a series of letters and depositions concerning the “mule imbroglio.” In 1864, Greene was accused and later found innocent of encouraging officers under his command to disobey an order that required all soldiers to turn over their mules to the government. The portion of the collection related to Mardi Gras includes receipts, bills, correspondence, invitations, parade programs, sketches and items related to artists hired by the Memphi to decorate for the celebrations. The collection also includes Colton Greene’s passport (containing a written description of his physical features), a photograph of Greene and a deed for property on Main Street which was sold to John H. Stephenson by Frederick H. Cossitt, founder of the Cossitt Library.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Greer Family Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J22</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The collection begins with a set of letters sent between David Searcy Greer and Martha Jane Dunlap.  The two were engaged in February 1833 and the wedding date was set for February 1835.  Meanwhile, Greer was working as a surveyor in the Indian Territory in North Mississippi.  Even so, the two corresponded frequently.  Their letters deal with personal matters including David’s please to shorten the couple’s engagement.  The letters also include accounts of family and community members and living conditions in Mississippi and Paris, Tennessee. -- The remaining documents deal with family and business matters after David and Martha Greer came to Memphis, Tennessee in 1842.  The items related to Martha Greer include a letter to John Ripley Greer from 1858 and another letter from Martha’s niece Sue Dunlap.  Other papers from the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century relate to John Ripley Greer, Sr.  The collection also contains letters of condolence from relatives and friends following John and Martha’s deaths.  These were sent to both John Ripley Greer, Jr. and his mother just before her death.  There are also a small number of items relating to John Ripley Greer, Jr. -- The collection includes a number of photographs, newspaper clippings, and other documents.  Most of the photographs are unfortunately unlabeled, but some have been identified using photographs appearing in newspaper articles.  Many of the newspaper articles were included in the original collection.  Others were copied, added from the Memphis and Shelby County Room’s vertical files.  Other documents were copied and added to the collection as well.  These include the probate records of David Searcy Greer and images from an 1888 property map of Shelby County.</dc:description>

<dc:title>E.W. Hale Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>F22-F33, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>E. William Hale was born in 1875 in Oxford Mississippi, and moved with his family to Whitehaven in 1894. In addition to running a farm, the Hale family owned a general store at the corner of Highway 51 and Whitehaven-Capleville Road in rural Shelby County. After graduating from Whitehaven High School in 1893, Hale joined his father in operating the J.W. Hale and Son Mercantile Store. In 1906 E.W. Hale was elected magistrate of the 12th district. As a member of the county court, Hale acted as the legislator and the presiding judge for his district. -- In 1911, Shelby County adopted the commission form of government to oversee the daily operation of county affairs. Made up of three elected officials, the commission maintained county roads, approved the founding of subdivisions and operated county facilities. With the support of Mayor E.H. Crump, Hale was elected a member of the first commission. He was elected commission chair in 1922, a position he held until his retirement in 1955. -- As chair of the commission, Hale established efficient county government which improved county schools and roads. His greatest accomplishment as commissioner was the founding of the Shelby County Penal Farm. Nationally recognized as a model prison facility, the penal farm also contributed to Shelby County’s agricultural economy. As the height of its output, the 5,017 acre farm had 1,700 head of livestock, produced 39 varieties of vegetables and produced 1,400 loaves of bread daily. -- When E.W. Hale died in 1959, he was praised as an honest public servant who contributed enormously to the development of Shelby County. Commenting on his death, Memphis Congressman Clifford Davis stated, “In his 44 years of devoted service to the city and county, Mr. Hale built a monument which will last until the very end of time… he filled a strong place in the material growth and development of this community as evidenced by the Shelby County Penal Farm, the Criminal Courts Building, roads, bridges and schools, but to me his strong and excellent character was even more impressive.” -- The E.W. Hale Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1977. The collection covers the years 1937 to 1954 and includes correspondence, government reports and photographs related to Hale’s career as chairman of the Shelby County Commission. In addition to Hale’s correspondence, the collection includes a small amount of correspondence belonging to Commissioners Francis Andrews, Rudolph Jones and Dan Mitchell. Much of the material in the collection concerns the operation of various Shelby County facilities and organizations including the Oakville Memorial Sanatorium, the Shelby County Hospital, the Shelby County Penal Farm, the Memphis/Shelby County Port and Harbor Commission, the Memphis/Shelby County Planning Commission, the Memphis/Shelby County Welfare Commission and the Works Progress Administration. The papers also contain material on the construction of the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, the 1940 and 1944 presidential elections and the development of subdivisions in Shelby County.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A. Arthur Halle Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B1-B2</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>A. Arthur Halle was born in Memphis in 1889. He attended the Linden Street School, Memphis University School, Betts Academy in Stamford, Connecticut, and Yale University, where he studied law. Halle’s time at Yale ended prematurely because of his father’s death. He returned to Memphis and became president of his family’s clothing business, Phil A. Halle Department Store, and continued in this position until his death. He married Dorothy Sternberg and the couple had two children, A. Arthur Halle, Jr. and Dorothy Sternberg Halle. The family lived for many years in the Midtown area before moving into a historic antebellum home in Cordova, which they named The Hollys. -- Halle was a principal organizer of the Memphis Cotton Carnival in 1931 and was also instrumental in reviving the Mystic Society of the Memphi, a secret social society. He served as Cotton Carnival president and General Chairman of the Parade Division and encouraged businesses and citizens to participate in the festival activities. His enthusiasm and love of the Cotton Carnival earned Halle the nickname “Mr. Cotton Carnival.” Halle also served as president of the Christmas Parade and participated in the Kiwanis Club, the Executives Club, the Community Fund and the Retail Merchants Association. He was involved in the Summit Club, the Petroleum Club and the Sesa Cesac Club and was a 32nd degree mason and an active member of Temple Israel. -- In 1942 Halle requested a civilian appointment to the United States War Department. He was made a Warehouse Specialist in the Quarter Master Corps and assigned to the depot in Ogden, Utah. He remained there from 1942 to 1945, and received a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel for his outstanding work. -- The A. Arthur Halle Collection covers the years 1917 to 1981 and contains business records, correspondence, legal documents, magazine and newspaper clippings and photographs related to all aspects of Halle’s life, including his business, civic and military work. The most valuable material in the collection relates to Halle’s involvement with the Cotton Carnival and includes more than 50 photographs from Carnival events from the years 1934 to 1959. Detailed information on The Mystic Order of the Memphi is also included, which provides a rare look into the operation and membership of a carnival society.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Beale Street Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B6</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Beale Street Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby county Room in 1980 by the Beale Street Development Corporation.  During the restoration of the 300 block of Beale Street, construction workers recovered many items which had probably been stored originally in the basement of the Pantaze Building at the intersection of Hernando and Beale and the projection room of the New Daisy Theatre.  The collection includes material from the late 1930s to the early 1960s on musical artists and businesses on Beale Street and some information on the restoration of the area. -- Much of the collection focuses on the music industry of Beale Street.  
Posters, concert tickets, handbills and publicity photographs advertising performing artists from the 1950s and 1960s are included in the collection.  The finding aid to the collection includes an “Index to Artists” which lists each musician, entertainer and concert venue mentioned in the collection. -- The portion of the collection related to businesses on Beale Street contains an historical sketch of the businesses and miscellaneous records including correspondence and receipts.  Papers from Club Ebony, Club Handy, the Daisy, New Daisy and Palace Theatres, Pantaze Drug Store, the Mitchell Hotel and Mitchell Grill and other Beale Street businesses are included.  Also included are contracts and letters, many of which relate to the business dealings of Andrew “Sunbeam” Mitchell, proprietor of Club Ebony and Club Handy. -- Information on the restoration of Beale Street includes landscape development plans.  A map showing an abandoned design for construction of a pedestrian mall on Beale Street is also included in this portion of the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Hallelujah! Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J21</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Hallelujah!, a film released in 1929, was the first all-black musical and was intended to be a dramatic portrayal of the lives of poor African Americans in the South. The producer and director, King Vidor, filmed on location in Memphis and Arkansas, and the interiors were shot at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Filming in several different locations led the director to use post-synchronized sound, another motion picture first which is sometimes credited to the film. -- Several Memphians were cast in the film, including Georgia Woodruff, who was unexpectedly asked to be the lead soprano of the Dixie Jubilee Singers in the movie. Eva Jessye, a life-long friend of Woodruff, directed the Dixie Jubilee Singers and was music supervisor for the film. Two other Memphians, Robert Couch and Milton Dickerson, also appeared in the film. These children were discovered while dancing for pennies in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel, and their dance was subsequently featured in the film. Couch was later offered a part in the “Our Gang Comedies” and went on to work with Memphis music legend Rufus Thomas. -- Vidor originally chose Paul Robeson to play the male lead, Zeke. However, because Robeson was unavailable, his understudy in the stage version of Show Boat, Daniel L. Haynes, was cast in the role. The female lead was played by Nina Mae McKinney, who was later called the “Black Garbo,” and the part of Zeke’s parson father was played by an 86-year-old ex-slave. Two of the musical numbers in the film, “Waiting at the End of the Road” and “Swanee Shuffle,” were written by Irving Berlin. -- Georgia Woodruff’s daughter, Rubye Woodruff Carter, donated The Hallelujah! Collection to the Memphis and Shelby County Room. The collection, which consists largely of photographs, includes publicity shots and scenes from the movie and photographs of the cast and crew on location in Memphis. The collection is supplemented by correspondence and newspaper clippings concerning Georgia Woodruff’s friend Eva Jessye, which illustrate Jessye’s long-standing career as a choral director. -- To emphasize the impact of Hallelujah! on film history, reviews from noted film anthologies and reference books have been added to the collection. Furthermore, since the library received special permission from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a one-time showing of the film at the Main Library in February 1986, the local publicity materials for this presentation have been duplicated and placed in the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>W.C. Handy Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R31</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>William Christopher Handy, the “Father of the Blues,” was born in 1873 in Florence, Alabama. His parents wanted Handy to become a minister, but he was more interested in music. Early in his career he directed the Knights of Pythias Band in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and then moved to Memphis, where he gained great popularity from his tunes The Memphis Blues (originally titled Mr. Crump) and Beale Street Blues. He co-founded the music publishing company, Pace and Handy Publishing Co., in 1918 and then moved to New York. Handy went on to earn worldwide success with his blues and spiritual compositions. By the time of his death in 1958, Handy was revered as a legend. He is honored in Memphis by a statue and a park on Beale Street. -- While planning the festivities for the 150th anniversary of Memphis, Memphis Sesquicentennial, Inc., under the direction of Brandon Davis, concluded that a stamp commemorating W.C. Handy would bring publicity to the city. A contest for a design was held, and the winning design, submitted by Bernice Kochan, was sent to the United States Post Office. The stamp was issued in Memphis on May 17, 1969. -- The W.C. Handy Collection, which relates primarily to the efforts to have a stamp created in Handy’s honor, consists of material which was gathered from individual donations and other collections. The collection includes the request for the W.C. Handy stamp, artistic designs and financial documents. These items were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Edward Williams, III, who handled the finances of the Memphis Stamp Collectors Society, which was instrumental in requesting the stamp. Also included are some of Handy’s personal letters and music, as well as information pertaining to the Handy memorial statue on Beale Street.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Papers of the Reverend George C. Harris</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O15-O16</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Reverend George C. Harris, a native of Mississippi, served as Assistant Minister at St. Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis from 1871 to 1872, and as Dean of the Cathedral from 1873 to 1880. The collection consists of correspondence related to Harris’ remarkable service to his parishioners and the citizens of Memphis during the yellow fever epidemics of the 1870s, business papers from the Harris family cattle and cotton farms and a scrapbook. The papers were gathered from The Yellow Fever Collection and The Montgomery Family Papers from the Memphis and Shelby County Room. -- Reverend Harris was ordained in 1860 and served as a Confederate chaplain during the Civil War. After the war, he settled in Memphis and began serving at St. Mary’s. During the yellow fever epidemics of 1873, 1878 and 1879, Reverend Harris sent his family to the Annandale Plantation in Canton, Mississippi, and the collection contains letters from his wife and children written to him during these periods. Reverend Harris remained at the Cathedral throughout the epidemics, and the collection includes correspondence related to his extraordinary efforts to recruit volunteers and raise funds from all over the United States to help the people of Memphis who were plagued by disease and death. -- In addition to his duties at St. Mary’s, Reverend Harris and his family owned agricultural properties they inherited from his family and that of his wife, Helen Johnstone Harris. The papers include correspondence, bills and receipts related to the family’s responsibilities on these farms. -- Reverend Harris kept a large scrapbook containing sermons, poems and newspaper clippings which reflect his personal interests such as providing aid to orphans, the yellow fever epidemics and his fellow clergy members at St. Mary’s Cathedral.</dc:description>

<dc:title>James Ashton Hayes Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J22-J23</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>James Ashton Hayes, distinguished Memphis educator, was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1865. Hayes received his A.B. degree in 1911 from Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, where he was an active participant in scholastic and athletic groups. -- Early in his career, Hayes taught at schools in Kentucky and Tennessee. While teaching in Kentucky, he was also an organizer of the Domestic Life Insurance Company of Louisville. His interest in athletics led him to accept a coaching position at Tennessee A&amp;I University in Nashville. From Nashville, Hayes came to Memphis, where his first job was as football coach at Booker T. Washington High School. He served a short term as principal of Douglass High School before being named principal of Manassas High School, a position he held for twenty-three years. -- When Hayes assumed leadership of Manassas, the school was inadequate for the needs of a rapidly expanding student body. Under Hayes’ strong leadership, a new Manassas High School was built in the mid-1930s. Hayes was not only an accomplished administrator but also a humanitarian who brought his staff and students through the hard days of the Great Depression. -- Hayes was an active participant in civic, church and public service organizations. As an educator and civic leader, he provided an outstanding role model for fellow teachers as well as for students. Hayes’ interest in his students extended beyond their years at Manassas, and he encouraged them to continue their education in college or in other areas of training. -- When the accreditation of Memphis public high schools required that each principal hold a master’s degree in education, Hayes stepped down so that a qualified younger man might be named principal of Manassas. He served an additional two years as principal of Lester Elementary School before retiring from the field of education in 1955. When James Ashton Hayes died in 1961, he was mourned by thousands of Memphians who held him in great esteem. -- The James Ashton Hayes Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Hayes’ widow, Rosalind Ross Hayes. It consists of correspondence, newspaper clippings, programs and photographs. A large scrapbook contains photographs, newspaper clippings, greeting cards, letters and awards. The bulk of the printed material is from 1953 and 1955 testimonial dinners honoring Hayes for his years of service as an educator and especially for his leadership as principal of Manassas High School. Many of the photographs depict Manassas students and faculty, while others are of Hayes and his professional colleagues. Of particular interest are the earlier photographs from Hayes’ years as a student at Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, and from summers spent as a college worker at Dawson Springs State Park in Dawson Springs, Kentucky.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Historical and Genealogical Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J18</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Historical and Genealogical Collection is a compilation of loose historical and genealogical papers and miscellaneous documents which have been given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by various individuals. Some of the papers are “found items” that came from attics and estate sales. The materials in the collection will assist individuals who are compiling family histories, as well as researchers seeking biographical and historical data. The finding aid to the collection has been organized by name and date. Additionally, the collection has been sorted by record type to assist researchers in finding particular types of documents. -- The collection includes the papers of Jean Robertson Anderson, which include a description of Jackson, Tennessee’s early town square written by Charles Barth in 1825 and information on more than 21 surnames. Other examples of documents in the collection are an 1865 furlough request by E.E. Elam, which describes him as “six foot high with a dark complexion,” an 1827 petition from heirs of Robert Goodloe who wanted to divide the land he left in his will and a probate document dated October 20, 1815, which explains the future ownership of Marriah, a ten-year-old slave girl. Valuable historical resources such as Bible records, letters and a Civil War journal are also included in the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Frank Holloman Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G1-G5, G11-G14, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Frank C. Holloman was born in Itta Bena, Mississippi, and grew up in nearby Ruleville. After graduating from Ruleville High School in 1932, Holloman attended the University of Mississippi, where he earned a law degree in 1937. Later that year he joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a Special Agent, and he served with this organization for the next twenty five years. -- During his service with the FBI, Holloman acted as Special Agent in Charge at the Atlanta, Cincinnati, Jackson, Mississippi and Memphis offices and conducted security inspections of South American war production plants. Perhaps most importantly, he was the inspector in charge of Director J. Edgar Hoover’s Washington office from 1949 to 1959. -- After retiring from the FBI in 1964, Holloman was named Director of Development for Memphis State University and then Executive Director of the Mid-South Medical Center Council. In 1968, Holloman was appointed the first Fire and Police Director of Memphis. Leaving the Memphis Police Department in October of 1970, Holloman became Coordinator of Security for the University of Missouri. He remained there in a full-time capacity until 1972 and served as part-time coordinator until 1978. Holloman returned to Memphis in 1972 to become Executive Director of Future Memphis, Inc., a position he held until his retirement in 1980. -- The Frank Holloman Collection, which was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mr. and Mrs. Frank Holloman, consists of personal letters, photographs and official documents spanning Holloman’s professional life. The collection includes material related to his service in the FBI and the Memphis Police Department, and the material gives details related to the inner workings of these law enforcement agencies. The material related to Holloman’s service as Fire and Police Director in Memphis is especially significant, because his period of service was marked by important events such as the sanitation workers’ strike and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Frank Holloman died in 1997 and is remembered as a man dedicated to law enforcement who served the citizens of Memphis during a very difficult period in its history.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Hugh Higbee Huhn Theater Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J22-J23, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>One of the most colorful chapters in the history of American journalism began in the late 19th century. In New York, fierce battles for circulation raged between newspaper publishers Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, who ran screaming headlines over the most sensational stories they could find. Eventually, newspapers nationwide followed suit. Although some periodicals were more respectful than others, all strove to entertain readers, not just inform them. -- This era gave birth to the career of Hugh Higbee Huhn, one of the South’s most respected drama critics. Huhn wrote for several Memphis newspapers in the early 1890s prior to working for The Commercial Appeal from 1897 to 1918. -- In those days, performers could not rely on movies or television to advance their careers, so they depended on national tours. Through his work as critic for the newspaper, Huhn was able to meet and befriend actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Ethel Barrymore, magician Harry Houdini, the minstrel Al G. Field and many other entertainers as they traveled around the country performing. The walls of Huhn’s office at The Commercial Appeal were lined with autographed photos of celebrities and his desk drawers were stuffed with letters from them. -- Huhn was born in Memphis in 1872, the son of accountant John Huhn and Mary Cowden. He worked briefly for Cole Manufacturing Co., and at Nick Williams’ bookstore. Huhn’s aunt, Jennie Higbee, got him his first newspaper job in the early 1890s at the Appeal-Avalanche. In 1894, The Commercial bought the paper, and Huhn left to work for the then-new Lyceum Theatre, where he worked in the box office, and then as press agent for the second Lyceum after the original theater burned down. Three years later he returned to journalism as a reporter for The Commercial Appeal. -- For years, Huhn filled an enormous amusements section in each Sunday paper. He is best remembered as a drama critic, but his assignments also included covering the police beat and writing editorials and political pieces. He also wrote about nature, and the annual arrival of the circus. From 1903 to1905 he served a term in the Tennessee General Assembly. He was also a nature lover, an inveterate walker in Overton Park and an owner and enthusiast of pure-bred dogs. -- In 1918, Huhn was 46 and living at 1882 Jefferson in Midtown Memphis when he was stricken with paralysis. He died four months later, and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery. Huhn was survived by his wife of two years, May Dunn Buchanan Huhn. -- After Huhn’s death, his widow became something of an institution at The Commercial Appeal. In 1918 May Huhn was hired as the newspaper’s switchboard operator. Her home became a temporary rooming house for new reporters, as well as a gathering place for morning chats over coffee. She stayed at the newspaper for 42 years, retiring in 1960. -- The Hugh Higbee Huhn Theater Collection consists primarily of articles and mementos from Huhn’s longtime career with Memphis newspapers, particularly The Commercial Appeal. Theater reviews, which comprise a major portion of the collection, are just a sampling of the enormous volume of material Huhn produced from the early 1890s until 1918. The collection also contains photographs, correspondence, scrapbooks and ticket stubs.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Blair Theodore Hunt Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B7-B8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Blair Theodore Hunt prominent Memphis educator, clergyman and civic leader, was the son of former slaves Blair Theodore and Emma Clark Hunt. He was a graduate of LeMoyne College and also received degrees from Morehouse College, Roger Williams College and Tennessee State University. Hunt married Ernestine Jacobs in 1918, and they had two sons, Wilson and Ernest. -- Hunt began his career as an educator in the Memphis Public School System in 1925 as principal of Kortrecht School. He was the principal of La Rose School from 1926 to 1932. From 1932 to 1959 he served as principal of Booker T. Washington High School, where he influenced many of the city’s future leaders. Among his most outstanding students was Benjamin Lawson Hooks, the first black member of the Federal Communications Commission and the Executive Director of the NAACP. After his retirement Hunt became the first African American member of the Shelby County Board of Education. -- For a number of years, Hunt was pastor of Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, where his sermons were an inspiration to many in the African American community. He began his career in the clergy as a chaplain with the rank of lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I. During World War II, he served as local chairman of the Office of Price Administration and the Office of Civil Defense, and he was the first African American to serve on the Tennessee Draft Board. Hunt was active in the Urban League, the Travelers Aid Society, the Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. He was also an active supporter of the United Negro College Fund. -- The Blair T. Hunt Papers were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by his family and Hunt’s long-time colleague and close friend, Ms. Harry Mae Simons. The papers include materials related to his personal life and his work as an educator and clergy member. Because a good deal of Hunt’s work was accomplished over the telephone and in personal conferences, the papers only hint at the respect held for him by countless Memphians, and the crucial role he played as a mediator in the city. -- Mr. Hunt received numerous accolades in appreciation for his years of service in Memphis, including having Blair T. Hunt Boulevard named after him. A few of these numerous honors are documented in the collection. The papers also include copies of many of his sermons, which were regularly printed in the Memphis World, and which exemplify his gift for oratory. In addition, the collection contains Hunt’s personal records, books from his personal library, correspondence, photographs and drafts of speeches.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Office Files of Robert B. James</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N6-N11</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Robert B. James served on the Memphis City Council from 1968 to 1988. During his twenty years as councilman, he accumulated many documents related to council business, as well as material from other organizations and events with which he was associated. The James collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mr. James, his wife Patrice and his children, Stephen and Linda, shortly after his retirement from the City Council. Mr. James has served as an active member of the Friends of the Library, and assisted in preparing the collection for use by researchers. -- The collection is a valuable resource for those researching Memphis during the latter half of the 20th century. It includes materials on a wide range of issues faced by the city including annexation, the city budget, crime, law enforcement and traffic. Information on development projects such as Beale Street, the Agricenter, Church Park and the Mid-America Mall, and material on Memphis streets and neighborhoods are also included in the collection. -- James was born in Chariton, Iowa, in 1908. It was here that he received his first business experience, working in farm marketing from 1925 until 1934. During this time he also attended the University of Iowa for two years. He was later employed by Firestone Tire and Rubber Company for four years before opening his own business, Memphis Building Maintenance, in 1938. He retired from this business after thirty years, and he served on the Memphis City Council from the time of his retirement. -- During James’ years on the city council, Memphis experienced much turmoil and growth. The first year of his first term saw a divisive strike by sanitation workers which culminated in the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. These events made Memphians aware of the need to face a variety of economic and social issues, and these issues were often discussed and addressed by the council. -- Leaders in Memphis were also concerned with attracting tourists and conventions to the city during James’ tenure. In addition to bringing temporary exhibits and artistic presentations to Memphis, city leaders began to make more long-range plans. Mr. James was involved in council decisions which made the development of Mud Island possible, as well as the building of the Cook Convention Center and the Pyramid. -- James held an interest in a broad range of civic matters. He was chairman of the Chickasaw Basin Authority from 1972 to 1982, and is perhaps best known for his work with this organization. In addition, he served as chair of the State Parole Board and head of the Mississippi-Arkansas-Tennessee Council of Governments. James also founded and served as chair of the local Crimestoppers, Inc., and viewed this as one of his greatest successes. -- In addition to his experience in business and politics, Mr. James served the city through volunteer work. Mr. James devoted many hours to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center through his role as president of the Friends of the Library. James was also an accomplished painter, and for an extended period he paid weekly visits to the Shelby County Penal Farm, where he volunteered as an art instructor.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Kennedy Book Club Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K17-K20</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Whitehaven in the early 1900s was a small community with two churches, a school with some forty pupils, two stores and about twenty homes. Each afternoon a group of young ladies who called themselves the Whitehaven Walking Club took a walk together. In the fall of 1902 members of the walking club met to organize what was to become the Kennedy Book Club. The group was organized to fill a need which these young women felt for a social and cultural organization, and was part of a national movement of study clubs for women which came into existence at the turn of the century. Founding member Elizabeth Farrow suggested that the club be named in honor of Sara Beaumont Kennedy, a well-known author and prominent club woman. The group created through this small beginning was to play a major leadership role in Whitehaven for a century. -- Members met semi-monthly on Saturday afternoons from October to June in members’ homes. Roll call was answered with famous quotations, and members prepared and presented programs, followed by a social hour and usually a concert. The club adopted as its motto “to recognize and to enrich life” and selected red and white as the club colors. During the club’s early years, the women studied a wide variety of topics including American literature, the Wars of America, the countries of Europe and American drama. -- By 1940, the Kennedy Book Club had one hundred members, and meetings were held in the Community Room at the Whitehaven School. During the war years, the club chose the theme International News and Views for its course of study. Members took classes in first-aid and nursing, and the club promoted home garden and conservation programs and also made bandages for the Red Cross. -- In 1968 members decided to withdraw from the demanding activities of the Tennessee Federation of Women’s Clubs, which the club had joined in 1907, and instead, use their money to support community projects and scholarships. The Whitehaven Public Library, Memphis Preparatory School and the Bethany Maternity Home were among the many recipients of the club’s fund-raising efforts. In 2002 the decision was made to disband the Kennedy Book Club and make a gift of its assets to the Memphis and Shelby County Room. -- The Kennedy Book Club Collection was donated by Adrienne Davis, past president and long-time member. The collection spans the one hundred year history of the club from its founding in 1902 to the Centennial Celebration Luncheon in 2002. The collection is composed of correspondence, documents, written histories of the club, newspaper clippings used for study, book reviews, agendas and minutes, financial records and bazaar records. The collection also contains a virtually complete set of yearbooks, as well as scrapbooks, memorabilia, plaques and photographs. -- From its beginning in 1902 the Kennedy Book Club made significant cultural and educational contributions in Whitehaven. The Kennedy Book Club Collection provides information regarding the growth, development and transition in the club and in the community. The club’s records show that its history parallels the history of the national women’s study club movement, which was founded to raise the educational and cultural aspirations of women. Through a study of The Kennedy Book Club Collection, researchers can trace the change in emphasis from self-education to philanthropy and service to the community.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Judge Samuel O. Bates Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Samuel O. Bates, a major figure in the Memphis legal community in the 20th century, was born in Ogden, Arkansas, a town named for his mother’s family.  In 1899, he came to Memphis to attend Christian Brothers College and graduated with honors in 1904.  He received his L.L.B. from Catholic University in Washington, D.C., in 1906 and was admitted to the Bar upon returning to Memphis the same year. -- Shortly after moving back to Memphis, Bates was elected an alderman of Lenox, then an eastern suburb of Memphis.  After a brief period of practicing law in a private firm, Bates was appointed Assistant District Attorney.  Early in his career, Bates became aware that many poor people did not have equal access to legal representation, so he used his influence to secure the passage of a Public Defender Law for Shelby County.  Only Oklahoma City and Los Angeles preceded Shelby Counn providing public defenders.  Bates eventually went on to serve as Memphis City Court Judge, Shelby County Attorney General, State Representative and State Senator. -- In 1934 Bates was appointed to fill a vacant position as Probate Judge, and he was elected to the position later that year.  He served in this position until 1947, when he resigned to become vice president and general counsel for the Commerce Title Guaranty Co.  Bates, whose father was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, was quite proud of his Irish heritage.  He was a founding member of the Irish Society of Memphis, and served as its president for the first ten years of its existence.  He served as president of the Kiwanis Club and as co-chairman of the Memphis Round Table of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and was active in various other civic and service organizations.  He was a political associate of E.H. Crump, and maintained his interest in local government after retiring from public service. -- The Judge Samuel O. Bates Papers primarily consist of correspondence from 1934, the year he became a probate judge.  The collection includes personal letters, correspondence concerning the Irish Society and professional correspondence.  The papers also contain Judge Bates’ obituary and an article about one of his earliest statements as a judge.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Sara Beaumont Kennedy Literary Collection with Papers of Walker Kennedy</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R12</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Sara Beaumont Cannon, a descendant of several prominent Revolutionary War soldiers, was born in Somerville, Tennessee in 1859. She was educated at St. Mary’s Hall in Raleigh, North Carolina, and began writing poetry while still a school girl. -- After returning to Tennessee, she continued writing, and asked Walker Kennedy, the talented new editorial writer of the Commercial Appeal, to critique her work. A friendship developed, and they were married in 1888. -- Sara Beaumont Kennedy was a prolific writer and was recognized nationally as one of the outstanding literary figures of her day. She wrote a poetry book called One Wish, a children’s book, two novels and numerous short stories, many of which were published in national magazines. Her poetry was regularly featured in the Commercial Appeal, and appeared in various national publications. -- Kennedy learned about journalism and the newspaper business alongside her husband, Walker Kennedy. After his death, she joined the editorial staff of the Commercial Appeal and came to be known as “the only woman paragrapher” of a major newspaper in the South. Her pieces for the Commercial Appeal reflect Kennedy’s wide variety of interests and her vast knowledge of history, the arts and nature. -- Sara Beaumont Kennedy died in 1920 and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery. In 1925 her portrait was made a part of the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery collection. -- Walker Kennedy was born in 1857 in Louisville, Kentucky. He began his career in journalism with the Louisville Courier—Journal, under the tutelage of the illustrious Henry Watterson. He moved to Memphis and joined the staff of the Memphis Appeal for a year before going to work in Nashville as the chief editorial writer for the Nashville American. He returned to Memphis and co-founded The Sunday Times. In 1896 he was named chief editorial writer of the Commercial Appeal, a position he held until his death in 1909. -- Like his wife, Walker Kennedy enjoyed success as a fiction writer. He published three novels, Javan Ben Seir, Secret of the Wet Woods and In the Dwellings of Silence, and contributed short stories and poems to several leading magazines. Sara and Walker Kennedy also shared a gift for public speaking and made frequent presentations at literary and civic gatherings. The Kennedy Book Club, a woman’s study club, was named in Sara’s honor, and she often lectured at the club meetings. -- The Sara Beaumont Kennedy Literary Collection with Papers of Walker Kennedy was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Sara’s nephew, Robert Hobson. The papers consist primarily of poems, short stories and editorials by Sara Kennedy and also include several books of poetry dating back to her years as a school girl. The collection also contains a scrapbook which belonged to Walker Kennedy and holds published short stories, poetry, speeches and editorials, as well as stories and tributes published at the time of his death. The finding aid to the collection includes a comprehensive list of the writings written by Sara and Walker Kennedy which are included in the papers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Searcy Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R13-R14</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Elizabeth Searcy was born in Memphis in 1877.  Her father, Captain Mark W. Searcy, had served as a scout with Nathan Bedford Forrest and was the superintendent of the Memphis Board of Health.  Elizabeth attended Miss Higbee’s School and studied art in Philadelphia. -- She went on to become a highly successful artist, specializing in etchings and watercolors.  Elizabeth taught art at St. Mary’s Hall in Burlington, New Jersey, and established studios in New York City and Washington, D.C.  Her work is included in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress. -- Searcy also received several commissions from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  She painted a portrait of President Roosevelt and several different views of the White House and the president’s birthplace.  The First Lady gave several of Searcy’s paintings to her husband as Christmas gifts and also praised her work in her daily newspaper column, My Day. -- In her later years Elizabeth returned to Memphis to live with her younger brother Albert and sister Marguerite.  Albert Searcy was employed by Irwin-Leatherman Cotton Company and was a member of the United Sons of Confederate Veterans.  Marguerite was employed by the New York Life Insurance Company for over thirty years, and as a young woman became a member of the United Daughters of Confederate Veterans and served as a sponsor of the Army of Tennessee United Confederate Veterans. -- The Searcy Collection, which was willed to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Elizabeth Searcy, contains letters exchanged between Elizabeth and Eleanor Roosevelt regarding her artwork and commissions.  The papers also include mementoes such as diplomas, scrapbooks and family Bibles reflecting the life and concerns of Elizabeth, Marguerite and Albert Searcy, their parents and members of their extended family.  Materials related to Searcy family member Paul Shirley include papers from his naval career during and after the Civil War, such as naval appointment documents signed by Franklin Pierce, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.  This extensive collection, which covers the years 1836 to 1960, also contains clippings, photographs, negatives, engravings and Confederate currency.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Leo M. Seligman Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K20</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Leo M. Seligman, who committed himself to helping men and women lead responsible and productive lives after prison, grew up in Germany in the early decades of the 20th Century.  He was born in 1900 in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany and served in the German army in World War I.  In 1932, he was sent to a Nazi concentration camp – his “crime” was having been born a Jew.  However, Seligman was fortunate enough to escape his brutal captors and flee to the United States in 1936.  He married Esther Bass of Memphis in 1939 and became a citizen of the United States on December 24, 1940.  He found a job working as a butcher and he and his wife eventually opened their own business. -- While struggling to start a grocery business in Memphis, Seligman encountered a customer who would purchase a specific amount of food once a week, spending only a very small amount of money.  He asked the man about his spending and discovered that he could only spend a small amount of money at a time because he was on parole from prison and was trapped in an exploitive work environment.  Seligman felt that this man was being treated unfairly and should receive a living wage for his skilled labor.  He agreed to supervise the man’s parole, and through this experience, his concern for the dignity and well-being of former prisoners began to grow. -- Seligman used his own money and sought out other financial assistance and community resources to help improve the lives of parolees.  He became chair of the Optimist Club Rehabilitation Committee, and through this position he worked to secure positive changes in correctional procedures, provide opportunities for employment and improve parole practices.  His efforts led to him becoming nationally known as a spokesperson for former prisoners and an expert on improving penal and parole practices. -- A high point in Seligman’s life was his appearance on the TV program, This Is Your Life, in recognition for his work with prisoners and parolees.  He was given a new Edsel car and received a variety of accolades, including invitations to appear at national correctional and employment conferences and letters from prominent individuals.  He went on to be featured in a number of publications including the magazines Reader’s Digest and Inside Detective.  He also received honors from numerous organizations including the Optimist Club, the Sertoma Club and the Daughters of the American Revolution. -- Seligman helped nearly 2,000 parolees obtain a fresh start in life.  He assisted the former prisoners in obtaining employment, proper clothing and a suitable place to live.  He also saw that the men had enough money until they received their first paycheck.  His continued advocacy for parolees reflected his statement that, “I am my brother’s keeper.” -- The Leo M. Seligman Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Ernest W. Stix, Jr. and Hattie Bass in July 1998.  The collection includes newspaper clippings, photographs and awards, as well as interviews with journalists who wrote about Seligman’s early life, his struggle to build a new business and his determination to help former prisoners.  Also included is correspondence with law enforcement officials and representatives from employment organizations.  Significant portions of the collection relate to Seligman’s appearance on This Is Your Life.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Reverend Eron M. Sharp Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R4-R7</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Eron Malcolm Sharp was born in Leake County, Mississippi in 1904.  He graduated from Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi, and became a Methodist minister after receiving an M.A. in Religious Education from Duke University.  Reverend Sharp was pastor for several churches during his career, including Hernando First United Methodist Church, Aberdeen First United Methodist Church, New Albany First United Methodist Church and Greenwood First United Methodist Church. -- Sharp was secretary of the North Mississippi Conference of the Methodist Church for seventeen years and edited the Conference Journal.  He also served as Chair of the conference Historical Society for several terms and assisted in establishing the Methodist State Archives at Millsaps College.  He was among the founders of Lake Stephens United Methodist Camp in Oxford, Mississippi and served on its board for several years. -- After his retirement from the clergy, Sharp worked as an Assistant Circulation Librarian at Memphis State University for ten years.  He also taught Bible studies classes at Grenada College and served for seven years as the first Chaplain at Wesley Highland Towers, a Memphis retirement home. -- In addition to his work in the community and the Methodist Church, Reverend Sharp was a highly skilled and experienced genealogist.  He wrote several genealogy and local history books and collected a large number of genealogical resources.  The Reverend E. M. Sharp Collection, which consists of genealogical material, was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Reverend Sharp’s widow, Alma Blissit Sharp, after his death.  The papers contain much information that will be useful to local historians and genealogists.  The collection consists of genealogical information on families from several southeastern states and includes census records, Bible records, wills, church records, deeds, pedigree charts, photographs, marriage records, pension records, military service records, land grants and numerous other genealogical records.  Data on hundreds of families can be accessed through the comprehensive finding aid to the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Thomas T. Hill Shelby Farms Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>R30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Thomas T. Hill Shelby Farms Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Christopher A. Mekow, a park ranger in Shelby Farms, who used the material to write a history of the park. Mekow received the papers from Thomas Hill, who served as an administrator of Shelby Farms for 12 years. Once he had completed his research in 2000, Mekow gave the material to the library. -- The collection includes extensive correspondence to and from Hill during his time as an administrator of Shelby Farms along with minutes from staff meetings, memos, newspaper clippings and photographs. Hill was named superintendent of the park in 1984, and during his tenure he received considerable recognition for his outstanding achievements. When he retired in 1996, the Shelby Farms Board made him Superintendent Emeritus to honor his exceptional leadership and special contributions to the park. -- Hill’s duties as superintendent of Shelby Farms included supervising some 20 employees, establishing regulations for the shooting range and recreation areas and overseeing the management of a 4,500 acre nature preserve. Additional responsibilities included directing the maintenance of the park, serving as a liaison with various community officials, including the Director of Public Works and consulting with the Shelby Farms Board. -- Hill helped develop a detailed master plan for park services, as well as proposals for its future development. He worked with public officials and private citizens to enhance and preserve Shelby Farms, which is the world’s largest urban park. Hill continually addressed the concerted efforts of real estate developers to construct a major highway through Shelby Farms to increase access to suburbs in east Shelby County. His energies were often focused on environmental challenges and complex aspects of forestry development and maintenance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Maxine Atkins was born in 1929, the youngest of the three children of Joseph and Georgia Rounds Atkins.  Maxine graduated from Booker T. Washington High School at age 15 in 1945.  She went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree in biology from Spelman College in 1949 and a Master’s degree in French from Middlebury College in Vermont.  She was assistant professor of French at Prairie View A&amp;M University in Prairie View, Texas and at Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee.  She also taught briefly at LeMoyne College following her marriage to Dr. Vasco A. Smith, Jr., in 1955 and before the birth of their son, Vasco A. Smith, III in 1956. -- In 1957, Maxine Smith, along with Laura Sugarmon, was denied admission to the Memphis State University graduate program.  This injustice inspired Smith to begin her involvement in the work of the Memphis Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which had been organized by Robert R. Church, Jr., and other leaders of the African American community in 1918.  In 1962, Smith was named Executive Secretary of the Memphis Branch, and she served tirelessly in that position until her retirement in 1995.  Throughout her involvement with the NAACP, particularly in her role as Executive Secretary, Smith was a major force in shaping and directing the work of this organization at the local and national level. -- In addition to her work with the NAACP, Smith received national recognition for her significant contributions to urban education.  In 1971, Smith was the first African American to be elected to the Memphis Board of Education, and she served as Board of Education President for two terms.  In 1994, Governor Ned McWherter appointed Smith to the Tennessee Board of Regents, which is the governing body for many public colleges and universities throughout the state. -- Throughout her career, Smith has received countless awards for her commitment to education, social justice and civil rights.  Along with former president Bill Clinton, Smith was the recipient of the prestigious Freedom Award presented by the National Civil Rights Museum in 2003.  Smith was also awarded the Doctor of Humane Letters from her alma mater, Spelman College in 2004. -- The Maxine A. Smith NAACP Collection was given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mrs. Smith in 1996 following her retirement in 1995 as Executive Secretary of the Memphis Branch.  The extensive collection provides highly-detailed documentation of the efforts of the NAACP to ensure equal rights for African Americans through a wide-range of actions such as meeting with elected officials, holding voter registration drives, requesting investigations of police brutality and coordinating protests, boycotts, circulating petitions, picketing and sit-ins to integrate public facilities.  The material, which covers the years 1958 through 1995, includes correspondence, meeting agendas, annual reports, scrapbooks and a large collection of newspaper clippings.  The collection documents the Memphis Branch’s local efforts such as investigating individual’s complaints of workplace discrimination at local businesses, and national efforts such as advocating for the conformation of Thurgood Marshall as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.  There are gaps in the material, some of which was lost in the several moves of the local office or from water damage; nevertheless, there is enough continuity in the collection to provide a clear and detailed picture of the activities of the organization and the important role of the Executive Secretary in shaping and accomplishing the goals of the Memphis Branch.</dc:description>

MAXINE A. SMITH—BIOGRAPHY
No single individual in Memphis has been more uniquely associated with an organization than has Maxine Atkins Smith with the Memphis Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Soon after her marriage in 1955, Smith became an active member of the Memphis Branch, serving as Executive Secretary from 1962 until her retirement from that position in December 1995. Over the years, she has become the personification of the organization.
Still active in civil rights and social justice, Smith was honored recipient in 2003 of the prestigious Freedom Award presented by the National Civil Rights Museum. She shared this honor with former President Bill Clinton. Most recently she was awarded the Doctor of Humane Letters from her alma mater, Spelman College in Atlanta. Countless awards, honors, and two doctoral degrees have been bestowed on the woman who has spent the greater part of her life fighting battles that few would choose or long endure. Such commitment is all the more extraordinary in the face of serious health problems that have taken their toll on the woman who has symbolized Black rights in Memphis.
While Smith has had the guidance and counsel of equally dedicated Black leaders in business, law, education and ministry, her strongest support throughout the years has come from her husband, Dr. Vasco A. Smith, Jr., who has shared his wife’s dedication to the struggle for human dignity and human rights. Elected to the County Commission (then the Shelby County Court) in 1973, Dr. Smith served in this government body until his retirement from active political life in 1994. He has been a lifetime partner with his wife in every phase of their commitment to social justice, health, education, and political participation in the democratic process.
Maxine Atkins was born October 31, 1929, the youngest of three children born to Joseph P. and Georgia Rounds Atkins. Maxine’s mother was a homemaker and her father an employee of the U.S. Postal Service. From him she inherited that outspoken quality which refused to accept second class citizenship and discriminatory treatment. Maxine graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1945 (at age 15), from Spelman College in Atlanta in 1949 with the A.B. degree in biology, and from Middlebury College in Vermont with an M.A. in French. She was assistant professor of French at Prairie View A&amp;M University in Prairie View, Texas and at Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee. Following her marriage to Dr. Vasco A. Smith, Jr., in 1955, Maxine Smith taught briefly at LeMoyne College prior to the birth of their son, Vasco A. Smith, III in 1956. 3
With two college degrees, Smith, along with Laura Sugarmon, was denied admission to the Memphis State University graduate program in 1957. This affront provided the impetus that began her involvement in the work of the Memphis Branch NAACP. She was, during her tenure as Executive Secretary, a major force in shaping and directing the work of this organization at the local, state and national levels. Smith believes her most important accomplishments have been in the field of education, and she has been recognized nationally for significant contributions to urban education. In 1971 Maxine Smith was the first Black elected to the Memphis Board of Education, later serving that body as president for two terms.
In addition to her work in behalf of education, Maxine Smith has built a strong alliance with the Memphis business community. One of the most successful examples of this partnership has been the annual Freedom Fund Galas, which have drawn nationally prominent individuals as speakers and have provided the major source of the operating budget for the Memphis Branch. Active in the Democratic Party, Smith has had frequent contact with governors and members of Congress, as well as local elected officials. Her long tenure as Executive Secretary of the Memphis Branch NAACP, as well as her active role in the national organization, has brought Maxine Smith widespread recognition.
For many, Maxine Smith represents the best of the Civil Rights Movement, while for others in the community her outspoken demands for justice and equality have garnered a wide range of negative feelings. Not always conciliatory, Smith has been unflinching in her dedication to achieving full participation in the American Dream for African Americans. Not content to rest on past accomplishment, Smith continues to maintain an active schedule in support of her vision of equality and justice for all.

The collection of materials designated as the Maxine A. Smith - NAACP Collection was given to the Library by Mrs. Smith in 1996 following her retirement in 1995 as Executive Secretary of the Memphis Branch. There are gaps in the material, some of which was lost in the several moves of the local office or from water damage; nevertheless, there is enough continuity in the collection to provide a clear and cogent picture of the activities of the organization and the important role of the Executive Secretary in shaping and accomplishing the goals of the Memphis Branch.
The local NAACP chapter has been recognized repeatedly on the national level for its large membership, its state and regional leadership, and its outstanding accomplishments as a force for civil rights and social justice. The Memphis Branch of the NAACP not only provided regional leadership but also the National Executive Director Benjamin Lawson Hooks. Hooks worked closely with Smith and others in the Memphis Branch who held important national appointments.
Under the leadership of Robert R. Church, Jr., the Memphis Branch of the NAACP was organized in 1918 with 53 leading members of the Memphis African American community. The role of this organization as the primary force for social justice in Memphis is clearly seen in the collection, which covers the years 1958 through 1995.
Soon after World War II, a small but dedicated core of Black Memphians undertook an uphill battle to achieve racial equality in the life and work of this community. In 1962 the Memphis Branch named Maxine A. Smith as Executive Secretary, little realizing at that time the wide-ranging impact of her work and dedication to social justice. The early civil rights work of this group was catapulted into the national spotlight following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as the Sanitation Workers’ Strike, which started as a labor protest, became the catalyst for major civil rights action. The papers also show that after Dr. King’s death, the local NAACP branch became more aggressive in demands for equality in the economic and political life of this city, including the full integration of public education, housing, employment, and the development of economic opportunity for Black-owned businesses.
Because of the size of this collection guide, brief notes in the Table of Contents will assist the researcher to locate material by date or by subject. The introduction to each box provides a more extensive description of its contents, which is followed by a description of each folder. The Annual Reports made by the Executive Secretary provide the best summary of each year’s work and note the disappointments, successes, and the unwavering commitment of the NAACP, Memphis Branch to full civil rights for Black Americans. 5

SCRAPBOOKS AND NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS
In addition to the correspondence, reports, and print material in Boxes I – XVIII, the Collection includes a large amount of newsprint. The Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Press- Scimitar, the Tri-State Defender, as well as neighborhood newspapers such as the Silver Saver, were regularly clipped by the Executive Secretary and the office staff, and on occasion Branch officers and members sent in clippings. The loose clippings have been organized chronologically and individually placed on gray mounts, the material on which Memphis Information File clippings are placed. (Because of the volume of clippings, mounting of earliest material is still in process.)
The collection contains five newspaper clippings scrapbooks, which include articles from 1961-1966. There is considerable overlap in the later books. These books are important because they detail activities of the Memphis Branch in the 1960s prior to the changes that came about as a result of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
The clippings reflect those issues and activities which were priority matters of the time. There is a heavy emphasis on all news items that pertain to the desegregation of the public schools and to the full integration of students, teachers, and auxiliary workers in the Memphis and Shelby County School System. Other topics include the elections of
Blacks to public office and especially to the Memphis Board of Education, police brutality, the economic development of Black businesses and greater employment opportunities for African Americans, as well as matters of national interest such as presidential elections and of international importance such as the sanctions imposed against South Africa because of apartheid.

<dc:title>Katherine Hinds Smythe Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K16, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Katherine Hinds was born in Mississippi and spent her early years in Tupelo.  She attended Randolph Macon Woman’s College in Virginia, but transferred to Southwestern College (now Rhodes) in Memphis and went on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in 1953.  With the goal of becoming a teacher, Katherine pursued a Master’s degree at Duke University, specializing in Southern literature. -- After graduating from Duke, Katherine returned to Memphis and married William Hamilton Smythe in 1955.  Her first teaching assignment was at East High School, followed by a position at Memphis State University, where she taught literature for four years.  She retired from teaching to have her first child, William Hamilton, in 1959.  She had a daughter, Katie in 1962 and another son, Clay in 1967.  As a young wife and mother she began working in philanthropy through membership in the Le Bonheur Club and the Junior League of Memphis. -- In addition to her public interests, Smythe dedicated much of her life to the management of Memorial Park Cemetery, which was founded by her grandfather, E. Clovis Hinds in 1924.  In 1963, Smythe began working part-time at Memorial Park, under the direction of her aunt, Bess Hinds Anderson, who had become president after the death of her father, E.C. Hinds.  Katherine Hinds Smythe assumed the leadership of the cemetery in 1978. -- While operating Memorial Park, Smythe continued her volunteer work by serving as president of the Junior League.  She also served as president of the Rhodes College International Alumni Association and president of the board of the Memphis∙Shelby County Public Library &amp; Information Center.  In addition, she helped organize the capital campaign for the Foundation for the Library, which raised more than $20 million for the construction of the Central Library. -- The photographs and papers in The Katherine Hinds Smythe Collection were given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mrs. Smythe in 2000.  The material documents the history of Memorial Park and includes advertisements, legal documents and papers pertaining to the cemetery’s advertising and public relations efforts from its founding in 1924 through the 1990s.  Also included is material on the Hinds-Smythe Cosmopolitan Funeral Home, which was a Midtown Memphis expansion of Memorial Park that operated from 1984 to 1996. -- The collection contains many photographs documenting the development of Memorial Park, including photos of E.C. Hinds, Katherine Hinds Smythe, her son Hamilton Smythe and the dedication of the Memorial Park Mausoleum in 1972.  A unique aspect of the collection is the material on Dionicio Rodríguez, the artist hired to create a Crystal Shrine Grotto and other sculptural works within Memorial Park.  The papers include correspondence with Rodríguez, articles written about the artist and documentation of his works in Memorial Park being added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.  The finding aid to the collection includes biographical information on other artists whose work is featured on the grounds of Memorial Park, including Marie Craig and Luther Hampton.  In addition, the materials include a description of Smythe’s publication, Distinguished Citizens of Midtown, which contains profiles of prominent Memphians who lived in the Central Gardens neighborhood, as well as portraits of the individuals profiled in the book.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Morris Solomon Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N5</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Morris Solomon was born in Lomza, Poland in 1894.  As a young man he moved to Memphis, where his relatives owned a small grocery store called the Sunset Market.  Solomon became a police officer in 1919, starting out as a patrolman and going on to serve as a mounted officer downtown.  He became the first detective of Jewish heritage in Memphis when he was promoted to detective sergeant.  He retired from the police force in 1942. -- Solomon was perhaps best known for solving the “Grey Hat Mystery” in 1927.  He spent months tracking down the killer of John E. Levy, the “Hot Tamale King.”  The only clue was a grey felt hat belonging to the murderer which was found at the scene of the crime.  Solomon took the hat door to door and had people try it on until a man named Thronbo Gunion confessed to the murder. -- Included in The Morris Solomon Papers are a number of items relating to his police work, such as a glossary of 1920s underworld terms, several of his “working notebooks” and the signed confession of a Mississippi murderer.  The papers also contain letters exchanged between Solomon and his wife Adein, which include many references to his police activities. -- Solomon was a veteran of World War I and a committed patriot.  He was active in the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars and frequently delivered speeches on local radio stations on topics such as national defense, communism and the rise of Nazi Germany.  The texts of many of these speeches are included in the collection. -- Also contained in the collection are numerous examples of different letterhead stationery, bank statements, postcards, materials which Solomon was apparently gathering for a textbook on police methodology and even a recording of him singing My Country, ‘Tis of Thee.  The collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Sears Roebuck and Co., which came into possession of the papers when the company purchased Solomon’s former home.  The papers were found in the attic, where they had remained for over 40 years.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Open Air Theater Programs</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N4</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Operettas and musicals provided a welcome escape from the hard realities of everyday life in the 1930s and ‘40s.  They had unforgettable melodies such as Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life and Indian Love Call, as well as rousing choruses, comic relief, interesting plots, romantic relationships and happy endings.  Memphians, along with people throughout the country, enjoyed operetta films with Jeannette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, and the performances at the Memphis Open Air Theater provided people in the community with similar live entertainment. -- MOAT was founded in 1938 under the sponsorship of the Junior Chamber of Commerce.  To prepare for the first season of five productions, the Memphis Park Commission budgeted $6,000 of improvements to the Shell – new spotlight towers, stage floors, lights, dressing rooms and sound equipment.  Ticket prices ranged from 25 cents to one dollar.  The first season ended with a deficit of $1,918.  The MOAT continued to experience financial difficulty until 1940, when the company celebrated its first profitable season. -- After several successful seasons, expenses for MOAT began to increase and attendance started to decline.  In August 1949 The Commercial Appeal asked its readers why fewer people were attending MOAT productions.  Readers responded that they disliked the style of comedy in the productions, the performances started too late and the intermissions were too lengthy.  Other factors such as hot and variable weather, a poor sound system, lack of needed improvements to the Shell stage and backstage area, inadequate parking and a desire for more contemporary musicals also led to declining attendance.  The company’s deficit climbed to $38,000 after the last MOAT season of 1951. -- During the years that the Memphis Open Air Theater was active, the Library collected programs from the performances.  Often, single programs, or small groups of programs, were given to the Library by individuals who attended the performances presented during the summer from 1938 through 1951.  The Memphis Open Air Theater Programs represent a compilation of these programs..  The finding aid to the collection lists the title, composer, director, conductor and principals, as well as supporting singers and actors for the MOAT productions.  In addition, the finding aid provides brief biographical information on some individuals associated with the MOAT.  While it lasted, the MOAT produced an impressive range of productions from 19th century operettas to contemporary musicals like Hit the Deck and Brigadoon.  The programs and playbills for many of the MOAT productions in this collection serve as the annals for the memorable MOAT summers. -- In addition to this collection of programs and playbills, the Memphis and Shelby County Room houses The Memphis Open Air Theater Collection which includes minutes from several MOAT committees and correspondence regarding the budget, efforts to increase attendance, scheduling of performances and selection of plays.</dc:description>

<dc:title>John Ogden Carley Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K26-K27</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>John Ogden Carley was born in East Ontario, Canada, in 1896. He worked for the Hearst papers as a police reporter in Los Angeles and Chicago before coming to Memphis in 1923 as a police reporter for the Commercial Appeal. He served as city editor and managing editor before becoming the editorial writer in 1939, where his editorials attracted national attention. Toward the end of World War II, he served as a correspondent in Europe covering the movement of Allied forces into German territory. -- Nicknamed “The Inspector” because of his dedication to his role as police reporter, Carley had a strong interest in law enforcement which led him to form a friendship with F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover. For twenty years he regularly addressed the graduating class of the F.B.I. National Police Academy. -- Carley was perhaps best known for his efforts in flood control. He supported the activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was a member of the Mississippi River Commission. His wife, Louise, was the daughter of Captain Anthony Meldahl, a famous river pilot, and Carley was instrumental, along with Kenneth McKellar and Clifford Davis, in bringing the Meldahl Dam Project to completion. -- In addition to his work in journalism and flood control, Carley was active in civic and community affairs. He served for six months as secretary for Mayor Rowlett Paine and was a charter member of the Memphis Newspaper Guild. He was also active as a Mason and acted in Memphis Little Theater productions. -- The John Ogden Carley Papers were donated to the library by his widow, Mrs. Louise Carley. The papers contain correspondence, newspaper clippings and photographs related to his interest in many varied subjects including yellow fever, the Mississippi River and the Meldahl Dam Project, E.H. Crump and the legend of George Armstrong Custer. In addition, the collection includes speeches Carley made to the graduating class of the police academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a period of twenty years.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Open Air Theater Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N4</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Several attempts were made in the early thirties, most notably by the Beethoven Club, to present operas and musicals in Overton Park during the summer.  These efforts were unsuccessful until 1937, when the Park Commission decided to present musicals in the Shell amphitheater which had been completed in Overton Park in 1936.  The enthusiasm and support for the idea of summertime musical entertainment led the Junior Chamber of Commerce to sponsor the creation of the Memphis Open Air Theater, or MOAT, a non-profit civic corporation.  MOAT began producing musicals with local and professional talent in the summer of 1938. -- The plays performed during the first season were successful and Memphis came to be seen as a cultural center of the Mid-South.  The success of the MOAT productions reflected the national trend of musicals being presented in public venues during the summer.  The theater company was a charter member of the National Civic Operetta Association that formed in 1946 to promote and coordinate the interests of organizations such as the MOAT, and the President of the MOAT became the first head of that association. -- In its early years, MOAT was relatively successful and extended its season from the initial five weeks to eight weeks.  However, with the extension of the season and the declining popularity of musicals, it became difficult to produce a season of completely new shows every year.  By the last season in 1951, five of the eight productions had been previously presented.  In addition, attendance began to decline, conflict erupted among MOAT leadership, and the company faced large deficits.  In January of 1952, MOAT members elected to continue the MOAT on a semi-professional basis, however, this plan was abandoned. -- The Memphis Open Air Theater Collection includes correspondence regarding scheduling of performances, selection of plays, efforts to increase attendance and the company’s budget.  Also included are minutes from various MOAT committees.  The Memphis Open Air Theater Programs, a collection of programs from MOAT productions, is also housed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Symphony Orchestra Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G-98</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Following several years of planning and preparation, the Memphis Symphony Orchestra gave its large collection of materials to the Library in 2006.  Included in the collection are programs, biographical profiles and publicity photographs of artists and conductors, advertising brochures, flyers and postcards.  Also included are the Board of Directors and Executive Committee minutes, as well as some fifty-three scrapbooks which contain press clippings and photographs.  The major collection is contained in some 70 boxes. -- Program material for the 1940s is sparse; however, by the late 1950s there is a full run of annual programs.  Alphabetical and date indexes to the performances and guest artists greatly facilitate researching this large collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Mid-South Flood Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N4-N5, Z</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Flooding impacted the society, business environment and ecology of the Mid-South.  These mostly man-made disasters interrupted and permeated all aspects of life until the mid-twentieth Century.  Floods were so frequent and sometimes so devastating that they became part of what defined the South.  Even areas relatively safe from high water such as Memphis suffered from the damage to the surrounding areas.  Because of this, no study of the history of the region can be complete without an examination of this terrible phenomenon. -- The movement of Europeans into the Mississippi Valley led to changes in the pattern of seasonal high water that was once part of the natural cycle of life.  Deforestation caused the gradual flow of rainwater from higher elevations to become a sudden torrent that caused rivers to overflow their banks.  The initial response was to construct dikes to protect individual pieces of property.  This idea eventually resulted in the construction of a system of levees along the Mississippi River. -- Unfortunately, the levees had the unintended effect of causing flooding to increase.  The more complete the levee system became, the fewer places flood waters had to flow.  The confined water continued to rise with each flood, and each time water would break through the weak places in the levees and back into unprotected tributaries.  Debates raged over the proper course of action to control the rivers, while engineers made futile attempts to restrain the floods.  Most clung to the old “levees only” approach until the “super floods” of 1927 and 1937.  It was in those years that the United States Army Corps of Engineers adopted new methods proposed by chief of the Corps of Engineers Edwin Jadwin and the nature of flood control changed forever. -- The Mid-South Flood Collection is made up of various documents relating to the issue of flooding in the greater Memphis area in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth Centuries.  There are many differing opinions represented in these writings, making this collection ideal for anyone interested in the development of flood control methodology.  These items were acquired by the library over many years, but never archived together.  The collection includes pamphlets, brochures, newspaper articles, journal articles, books, maps, photographs and scrapbooks.  Gathering these materials together gives researchers a better understanding of the issue of flooding, the many approaches to the problem and the controversy surrounding the development of flood control in the Mid-South region.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Official Papers of Shelby County Commissioner James W. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Moore</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N11-N14</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The story of James W. “Jimmy” Moore’s life sounds like the American dream.  Moore grew up in a small town and became a major league baseball player, playing in two world series.  He then became a business executive before beginning a successful political career which lasted until his retirement. -- Moore was born in 1902 in Bemis, Tennessee and attended high school in nearby Jackson.  He left Union University in Jackson during his third year there to begin a baseball career that lasted fourteen years.  In 1930 and 1931 he played with the Philadelphia Athletics, a team which won the pennant both years and the World Series in 1930. -- Following his baseball career, Moore worked for two decades as an executive with Yellow Cab Co. and Yellow Bus Line.  He also worked at Joyner Heard Realty Co. before being elected to the Memphis City Commission in 1959.  As Commissioner of Finance and Institutions, he was largely responsible for the construction of the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium and the Mid-South Coliseum.  The Memphis Metropolitan Airport was also completed during his administration. -- Moore resigned from the City Commission in 1966 to become County Commissioner of Health and Institutions.  He served in this capacity and on the transitional County Executive Committee until 1975, when the Shelby County government was restructured. -- The Moore papers consist of his office files from his years as county commissioner.  The material, which includes correspondence, memos, reports and other items related to the work of the Commissioner of Health and Institutions, gives researchers insight into the day-to-day operation of the Health Department.  The papers also include materials on subjects of particular importance during Moore’s terms of office such as whether an employee has a right to retain her maiden name after her marriage.  In addition, there is information on the restructure of the county government.  In addition to Moore’s office files, there are fourteen scrapbooks containing newspaper clippings from the years of his service to the city and county.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Earl Moreland Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Earl Moreland, a popular figure in Memphis radio and television, was born in Decatur County, Tennessee, and attended grammar school in Collierville, Tennessee.  His family then moved to Memphis, where Moreland attended Snowden Junior High and Central High School. -- Moreland showed a talent for drama in school, winning prizes in county declamation contests and holding parts in school plays.  He had the lead in his senior play, and was voted the most versatile boy in his senior class. -- In 1935 Moreland began his radio career as a rookie announcer at WHBQ in Memphis and then moved to station WMC in March of 1936.  Shortly after starting at WMC, Moreland began hosting an early morning music and monologue program, “Star Time,” which stayed on the air for more than 20 years.  He became chief announcer for WMC in 1939, and began serving as production manager in 1942. -- Moreland enlisted with the Army Signal Corps in World War II and was later transferred to Armed Forces Radio.  At the end of the war, Moreland became program director for Radio Tokyo and the Armed Forces Japanese Network. -- In 1946 Moreland resumed work with WMC as local sales manager and became commercial manager in 1950.  In 1954 he was promoted to station manager for WMCT television, and then assistant general manager of WMC Broadcasting, which included WMC, WMC-FM and WMCT. -- In addition to his work in radio and television, Moreland was active in community theater.  He participated in Memphis Little Theatre productions throughout the 1930s and 40s and won the theater’s “Oswald” award for best performance of the year for his performances in Margin for Error and Kiss and Tell. -- Moreland was a strong supporter of community organizations.  He served as Master of Ceremonies for the Cotton Carnival and president of the Civitan Club.  He was a member of the board of directors of the Salvation Army and the Girls Club of Memphis, Inc.  Moreland was also active with Boy Scouts and the Rotary Club.  In addition, he served as director of the Sales Executives Club, the Memphis Advertising Club, and the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. -- Earl Moreland died in 1963 from complications that arose during surgery for an injured vertebra.  He was 49 years old.  He left behind his wife, Mildred Sweetland Moreland, and a daughter, Carol. -- The Earl Moreland Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Mildred Moreland.  The collection is composed of letters, scripts, playbills and business materials that were saved by Moreland.  These items include much inside information about Memphis Little Theatre and WMC radio station.  In addition to the items donated by Mrs. Moreland, the collection includes an oral interview with Eugart Yerian, director of Memphis Little Theatre from 1933 to 1939 and 1947 to 1961.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Berl Olswanger Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B7</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Berl Olswanger, known as “Mr. Music,” was a highly talented and popular musician and civil leader in Memphis from the 1940s through the 1970s.  During his career he worked as a performer, composer, band leader and music teacher. -- Olswanger was raised in the North Memphis Pinch neighborhood.  A child prodigy, Berl began playing the piano at three years of age.  By age 12, he was the staff pianist for WMC Radio, and at 18, he was made leader of the radio station’s band.  He graduated from Central High School and earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Master’s Degree from Memphis State University. -- He enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II and was assigned to serve on a destroyer in the South Pacific.  When Admiral William F. Halsey heard Olswanger play piano for a service event, he made the talented young man an entertainment officer.  Olswanger left the navy in 1945 as a first lieutenant and briefly pursued a music career in New York City.  Yet he decided to come back to Memphis “to be with the people I love.”  In 1947, he married Edna Mae Long, and they had a daughter, Anna Ruth, and a son, Berl, Jr. -- After his return to Memphis, Olswanger opened a music store and formed a band.  In addition to composing and arranging music for his orchestra and playing piano at numerous solo engagements, Olswanger did a great deal to bring quality music to the people of Memphis by giving free concerts at schools, churches and civic clubs. -- Olswanger was an active member of the Downtown Kiwanis Club, and was installed as president in 1961.  He received the T.B. Kirkpatrick Memorial Award from the Kiwanis Club for outstanding service and leadership in the community as well as the Jewish Welfare Fund Award and the YMCA Man-for-Boy Award. -- From the late 1940s through 1965, Olswanger hosted television shows on WMC-TV, WHBQ-TV and WREC-TV.  In 1970, Olswanger was named music and art consultant and public relations director for the Shelby County Board of Education.  To further music education, he developed a music school associated with his stores and also organized a dance club so students and friends could enjoy his music. -- In 1980, to mark his fifty years as a musician and entertainer, he gave free programs for the many organizations which had supported him through the years.  At one such program, Olswanger received the Mayor’s Award of Merit. -- The Berl Olswanger Collection was originally given to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by his daughter Anna in 1985.  Substantial additions to the collection were made in later years.  The papers include newspaper clippings, photographs and a number of publications.  A significant portion of the material relates to research conducted by Anna on her father’s extensive career in music and public service.  Also included is material on Berl’s wife, Edna Long Olswanger, who was very involved in her husband’s musical career and shared his commitment to community service. Olswanger’s role as “Mr. Music” is represented in material related to his radio and television performances, while other information documents his long participation in the Downtown Kiwanis Club, the Goodfellows, the Memphis Cancer Society and other service groups.  Information related to the honors and recognition Olswanger received during his fifty years as a professional musician and entertainer is also included.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Papers of Memphis Mayor Watkins Overton</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>O22-O27, O31-O35</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Samuel Watkins Overton was born in Memphis in 1894 to a distinguished local family.  He was the great-grandson of John Overton, a founder of Memphis, the grandson of Napoleon Hill, a wealthy businessman, and the son of S. Watkins Overton, who built the first box plant in Memphis.  The family left Memphis for Waukesha, Wisconsin when Overton’s father died in 1902. -- Watkins Overton returned to Memphis after serving in France during World War I and graduating from the University of Chicago Law School.  In 1922 he joined the law firm founded by U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar.  Two years later Overton was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly, serving first in the House and then the Senate.  Through his service in the legislature and his association with McKellar, Overton was noticed by political leader E.H. Crump, who at that time was gaining power in Memphis.  Crump endorsed Overton as a candidate for Mayor in 1927; and with Overton’s election, Crump gained complete control of Memphis. -- Overton served Crump and Memphis for the next 12 years, but policy differences with Crump led to Overton’s resignation in 1939.  The two leaders reconciled, and in 1949 Overton was appointed Mayor by the City Commission with Crump’s approval.  The relationship deteriorated yet again, leading Overton to resign a second time in February 1953.  Overton attempted to regain his job as mayor after Crump’s death in 1954, but was unsuccessful. -- The Papers of Memphis Mayor Watkins Overton consist of his office files from his sixteen years of service as Mayor of Memphis.  Overton served as Mayor during the Great Depression, and his papers reflect the impact of New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration on the city.  The collection also sheds light on important issues such as public ownership of utilities, race relations, education and city growth.  A unique picture of municipal government can be found in these papers because of the commission form of government which was in operation at the time.  The commission was made up of the mayor and four commissioners who carried out legislative responsibilities and directed city departments. -- It is important to note that many of Mayor Overton’s files are housed in the Special Collections Department at the University of Memphis Ned R. WcWherter Library.  Researchers may wish to consult these files which contain information on local politics and include Overton’s correspondence with E.H. Crump.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Page/Lenox Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Warren Neville Page (1876 – 1945) was born in Calhoun County, Mississippi and moved to Memphis as a boy.  He went to work for Tracy Printing Co. at age 15.  After serving as an apprentice, Page became a linotype operator for the Appeal-Avalanche in 1892.  Later he worked for the Commercial Appeal, the Scimitar, the News-Scimitar, and finally the Press-Scimitar. -- Page served as state senator in the fifty-seventh General Assembly in 1910 – 1912 and was the first union member to be elected to the Senate.  He had been a member of the International Typographical Union for over fifty years and was elected president of the local chapter six times.  He also served several terms as president of the Memphis Trades and Labor Council.  Page was a charter member of the Memphis Moose Lodge and was also a member of the Masons, the Knights of Pythias, the Magnolia Camp of the Woodsmen of the World and the Maccabees. -- Page served as mayor of Lenox from 1905 to 1907.  Lenox was a small area incorporated as a city on October 7, 1896, and annexed into the city of Memphis September 1, 1909.  Its boundaries were Poplar Avenue on the north, Central on the south, Trezevant on the east and Cooper on the west.  The town’s history dates back to 1890, when the area was created as a subdivision by the Equitable Land and Construction Co.  The subdivision was a result of the building of the East End Railway Co., known as a “dummy line,” which linked eastern areas such as Lenox to Memphis. -- While Page served as mayor of Lenox, water and sewer systems were completed, fire hydrants were installed and sidewalks were constructed.  In 1909, Page served as chair of the building committee of Lenox School, which operated as an elementary school until 1972.  In 1973, it became a special education facility.  Lenox School was officially closed in 1977 and has since been converted into condominiums. -- The Page/Lenox Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in 1980 by Marguerite Page Botto.  Most of the material in the collection, which includes newspaper articles, photographs and correspondence, dates from 1904 to 1915.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Index to The Memphis Historical Society Papers</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>J18</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Memphis Historical Society had its roots in the Old Folks of Shelby County, which was founded in 1857 and published a journal called the Old Folks Record.  This organization evolved into the Confederate Relief and Historical Association in 1866 and then the Confederate Historical Association in 1869.  In 1884 the group came to be known as Camp 28, United Confederate Veterans, which published The Old Guard in Gray.  The group reorganized in 1900 as the Memphis Historical Society under John Preston Young.  In 1912, Young published the Standard History of Memphis Tennessee.  Finally, in 1935, the organization grew to encompass all of West Tennessee and adopted the West Tennessee Historical Society as their name.  Today, the group, which publishes The West Tennessee Historical Papers, serves to preserve the history of West Tennessee through collecting historical documents and conserving landmark structures. -- This collection includes lectures presented to the society by its members before the organization began publishing The West Tennessee Historical Papers.  The lectures, which provide valuable insight into the early history of Memphis, include papers on John Overton, Marcus Winchester, Christian Brothers College, Fort Pickering, Fort Assumption, and the park system in Memphis.  The finding aid to the collection contains a comprehensive index of the subjects addressed in the lectures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over many years the Memphis and Shelby County Room has collected print and photographic materials on the history of Memphis, Shelby County and the surrounding area.  This collection of Harper’s Weekly Newspaper and Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper prints, along with some photographs from 19th Century publications, provides visual documentation of the Memphis area prior to the period when photography became the common means of depicting events and places.  Many of the earliest prints provide the only visual record of Memphis for the period prior to the Civil War. -- Many of the prints show Civil War battles and engagements in Tennessee and the surrounding region.  Of particular interest are the images showing the naval battle at Memphis between Union and Confederate fleets.  Following the defeat of the confederate gunboat flotilla by the Union naval force, Memphis surrendered to the Federal command, which prevented a land battle for possession of the city. -- Another important group of images show flooding on the Mississippi River, as well as government efforts to stabilize the river banks.  Images of the devastating yellow fever epidemic of 1878 provide the only visuals for that terrible event, which had such a dramatic impact on life in Memphis.  Other sketches depict important buildings and significant public events that took place in Memphis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Records of the Memphis Sub-District of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>Microfilm</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Congress established the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, or Freedmen’s Bureau as it was commonly known, in March 1865 as the end of the Civil War drew near.  An agency of the War Department, the Freedmen’s Bureau had two main responsibilities: aiding former slaves in their transition to freedom and disposing of confiscated and abandoned lands.  Clinton B. Fisk served as the first Assistant commissioner for the District of Tennessee in Nashville.  Under Fisk’s supervision, Davis Tillson began work as Memphis’s first Sub-Assistant Commissioner in July 1865.  Over time, however, the opponents of the Bureau in Congress succeeded in diminishing its purview and authority.  After 1869, the agency was primarily concerned with aiding veterans of the United States Colored Troops collect pension and bounty payments.  The Freedmen’s Bureau maintained an office in Memphis through 1872, the last year of the agency’s operation. -- Reproduced on microfilm from the holdings of the National Archives, the records of the Memphis Sub-District reflect the agency’s focus on property disposition and assisting the freedmen.  This collection was reproduced at the request of the History Department as part of its commitment to preserve and make available local records for historical and genealogical research.  The Friends of the Library made the purchase of this collection possible through a generous donation. -- The Memphis Sub-District office was administered by the Sub-Assistant Commissioner and the Disbursing Officer of Claims.  Correspondence to and from these officials constitute the single largest type of record in the collection.  Also included are records of other staff officers and correspondence from Bureau officials in Washington, D.C., and Nashville, field agents from surrounding counties, former slave owners, freedmen, municipal officials, planters and farmers, property owners and representatives of benevolent societies such as the American Missionary Association.  The records also include numerous letters relating to office management, personnel and costs.  These documents provide much information about the operation of the Sub-District and the responsibilities and activities of its agents, and reflect the conditions under which these men worked including staffing shortages and an often volatile political climate. -- One remarkable portion of the records are the small number of letters from African Americans seeking information about missing relatives, many of whom had been dispersed by slave sales.  Correspondents asked Bureau agents for their help in locating people in Memphis or a nearby area.  Unfortunately, there is no record in this collection of whether reunions eventually occurred.  Nevertheless, these letters document the vulnerability of African Americans under slavery and post-Emancipation efforts to reunite families. -- These documents are an exceptional resource for historians, genealogists, and students of the Civil War and Reconstruction.  Researchers will find much evidence of social, economic and political conditions including race relations, labor issues, health conditions and public education.  There is also much information about how the Bureau operated and its working relationships with city officials and benevolent societies. -- For researchers of African American subjects, individuals or families, the Bureau records are significant.  Some genealogists, for example, may find evidence to extend their research into the pre-Civil War period.  Letters, affidavits and other documents pertaining to the United States Colored Troops are especially promising in this regard.  Genealogists and others searching for information about white individuals should also consult these records. Of particular interest will be such property records as applications for the restoration of property, rental receipts and a register of plantations, as well as oaths of allegiance.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Cemetery Burial Place Record of the Congregation Beth El Emeth</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Congregation Beth El Emeth, which means House of the True God, was founded as an Orthodox house of worship in 1861 by Rabbi Jacob Peres and forty former congregants of B’nai Israel, Congregation Children of Israel.  Beth El Emeth was chartered by the Tennessee legislature in 1862 and a dedication ceremony took place at a location on Jefferson near Front Street.  In 1863 the Congregation elected Rabbi Joel Alexander of Brooklyn, New York as its first spiritual leader.  Ferdinand Sarner was subsequently hired as the Rabbi of Beth El Emeth in 1872; he died in the 1878 Yellow Fever epidemic. -- In 1882 the Congregation consolidated with Congregation Children of Israel.  However, in 1916 Congregation Beth El Emeth split a second time split from Congregation Children of Israel anrchased the Children of Israel building at 165 Poplar Avenue.  The congregants of Beth El Emeth met at this building until 1957, when they constructed a new house of worship at 3771 Poplar Avenue.  Beth El Emeth merged with Anshei Sphard Congregation in 1965 to form Anshei Sphard—Beth El Emeth congregation.  Since 1971 the Congregation has worshiped at a synagogue they constructed at 170 East Yates Road. -- The congregation’s original funeral ledger book was loaned to the Memphis and Shelby County Room for photocopying in 2002.  The ledger book dates from the 1860s to the 1880s and is an excellent resource for people conducting research in Jewish family history and local history.  The records include the name of the deceased, their birthplace, their place of residence and the date of death, as well as the cemetery section number.  The original ledger book is housed among the historical documents at Congregation Anshei Sphard—Beth El Emeth.</dc:description>

In trying to decide what the DAR/SAR/CAR
Tennessee Homecoming ’86 project would be, we,
the members of the Mallory/Neely House, decided
to restore the Rose Gardens at our Chapter House.
After consultations with experts and visits to the
site by knowledgeable rosarians, it was their decision
that our “Rose Garden Restoration” project would not
be feasible. Pollution and shade were our enemies.
Well, as our forefathers did, we met our enemy, and
although we didn’t win the war, we did win our particular
battle! That is how the “Boxwood Garden Restoration” 10
came into being.
We’ve worked, we’ve partied, we’ve spend our money,
we’ve fought the 1986 drought, and our infamous poison
ivy, we’ve fussed among ourselves, BUT, now that the
restoration is completed, WE ARE PROUD!
Did I say Completed???
THE PROJECT FOR 1987 IS OUR LAWN!!

Invocation
By Dr. Robert D. Tice
Lord, we are indeed grateful to be able to gather here this afternoon to dedicate the planting of one of your creations – a sapling of a beautiful species that was long ago chosen as one of the symbols of our state. It is fitting that this young tree – so near the beginning of it’s life – should grace the landscape of this beautiful home which reminds us all of an era past. Thus, as the young and the old come together here today we are again reminded of your infinite wisdom in establishing the ongoing cycle of life in your universe. We ask your blessing on this tree. Give it a long and beautiful life. We also ask that everyone responsible for this occasion – whether present here today or not – be blessed with these things we ask in your name.
Amen!

<dc:title>Metropolitan Opera in Memphis Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Metropolitan Opera in Memphis Programs Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by several individuals over many years.  The programs were then gathered together to create this collection which consists of programs for individual performances in Memphis of New York's Metropolitan Opera Company from 1946 to 1984.  In 1946, Memphis businessman Isaac L. Myers convinced his friend Edward Johnson, manager of the Metropolitan Opera, to stage productions in Memphis.  On May 20, 1946, the world-renowned opera company performed &quot;Carmen&quot; at the Ellis Auditorium, and the following evening &quot;Madam Butterfly&quot; was staged.  For the next 37 years, the Met performed regularly in Memphis during their annual U.S. tour.  Many noted opera singers performed in his during the Metropolitan Opera's visits to Memphis, including Placido Domingo, Marilyn Horne, Luciano Pavarotti and Beverly Sills.  On May 14, 1984, the Met staged its final performance in Memphis with the presentation of &quot;Tosca&quot;.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Opera Theatre / Opera Memphis Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Memphis Opera Theatre/Opera Memphis Programs Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by several individuals over many years.  The programs were then gathered together to create this collection which consists of programs for individual performances of the Memphis Opera Theatre and Opera Memphis from 1956 to 2008.  The Memphis Opera Theatre was established in 1956 by civic leaders and members of the Beethoven Club.  The first event, and Introduction to Opera, was offered at the Goodwyn Institute Auditorium on October 9, 1956.  &quot;La Traviata&quot; was the first production performed by the Memphis Opera Theatre on March 29, 1957, at Ellis Auditorium.  In 1973, the organization merged with the Memphis State Opera Theater, and in 1977, it was renamed Opera Memphis.  Over the years Opera Memphis performed many world-renowned operas including &quot;Tosca,&quot; &quot;Carmen,&quot; &quot;Don Giovanni,&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;.  Several performers who made their debuts with Opera Memphis went on to have distinguished careers with the Metropolitan Opera, including Ruth Welting, Patricia Welting, Gail Robinson and Richard Vernon.  Opera Memphis also introduced the operas &quot;Deseret,&quot; &quot;Riversongs,&quot; Different Fields&quot; and Michael Chang's &quot;Buoso's Ghost.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Heritage Cultural Resources Survey - Addendum 2</dc:title>
<dc:description>Memphis Heritage, Inc., the city's leading historic preservation group was founded in October 1975.  Some of its major accomplishments include historic building and neighborhood surveys which have helped Memphis preserve and list many structures on the National Register of Historic Places.  These records, which form the Memphis Heritage Collection, were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by the organization.  The collection contains field reports and photographs of historic Memphis neighborhoods examined by Memphis surveyors in 1988-1994 and 1999-2002.  This section of the survey consists of five albums prepared for Memphis Heritage, Inc.'s City of Memphis Cultural Resources Survey, a joint project funded in part by the Tennessee Historical Commission and the City of Memphis's Division of Housing and Community Development.  Each neighborhood survey provides information on the area's historic significance, physical description, architect, types of houses, builders, and the historical background and community information.  Each neighborhood survey also includes photographs of houses and streets in the area, as well as plat maps, a history of the neighborhood, and a statement of significance.  Bibliographies of sources used are also included.  Researchers will find a wealth of significant information on the neighborhoods which place them in a historical context.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Jacob C. H. Meanley Riverboat Photograph Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S31</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Jacob C.H. Meanley Riverboat Photography Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center by Jacob Meanley in December 1995.  The collection contains 71 photographs of boats that plied the Mississippi River during the late-19th and early-20th centuries, including such famous boats as the Robert E. Lee and the Sultana.  Detailed information on the history of the majority of vessels is also contained in the collection.  Jacob Chandler Harper Meanley was born in Memphis to Thomas Meredith and Carol Kimball Meanley in 1949.  As a young man, Meanley helped his father build excursion riverboats which began his lifelong fascination with the Mississippi River.  In 1960, his father bought the Memphis Queen II riverboat where he took passengers on scenic trips down the Mississippi near Memphis.  Eventually the enterprise expanded into Memphis Queen Lines which operated four passenger excursion boats.  At age 18, Meanley became the youngest river pilot on the Mississippi and when his father retired in 1984, he became co-owner of the Memphis Queen Lines.  According to his brother Gerald, Meanley loved the &quot;stark beauty of the river and the fact that it was always changing.  Every time he went out, there was always something new to show.&quot;  Meanley died in June 2000 at the age of 51 and was mourned by many in Memphis.  Commenting on Meanley's passing, longtime downtown observer Jimmy Ogle stated: &quot;It's the passing of an era on the riverfront.  He knew the river better than anybody.  He could tell you anything about it, any boat going up the river.&quot;</dc:description>

<dc:title>Pioneers Black Firefighters of Memphis Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S34</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Twelve men in 1955 made history when they became the first African-American firefighters in Memphis, Tennessee.  They endured inequitable conditions and discrimination from the very beginning.  They were forced to live in segregated quarters, at Fire Station No. 8 at Mississippi and Crump, until the fire department was desegregated in 1966.  For many years, they suffered through both legal and institutional racism due to their status as second-class citizens.  The Pioneers Black Fire Fighters, Inc. was chartered and established in 1973.  They provided a support system for African-American firefighters in Memphis.  Their purpose was to deal with any problematic situations that arose in the workplace as a result of racial discrimination, such as promotions, disciplinary actions, hiring practices, and so on.  Carl Stotts, one of the original twelve hired in 1955, filed a federal class-action racial discrimination lawsuit that resulted in a 1980 consent decree in which the Memphis Fire Department agreed to promote black firefighters in greater numbers.  The Pioneers organization was with him throughout the process; they wanted to ensure that every African-American received the benefits and equal treatment to which he was entitled.  While legally they tried to protect the rights and representation of African-Americans, unofficially they served as an arena in which the African-Americans could interact socially and bond.  They organized social activities such as dances, picnics, and dinners for the members and their families.  In addition, they were committed to educating and inspiring the younger generations; they led fundraisers for various youth organizations and schools.  They also held educational programs and talks for the younger generations, ensuring that the legacy of those before them would not be forgotten.  They believed that community involvement was just as important as commitment to their organization, and demonstrated that through their support and involvement in hospitals, churches, schools and various other institutions.  The collection was a gift of Robert J. Crawford, one of the original twelve firefighters hired in 1955.  He was the original president and founder of the Pioneers Black Firefighters of Memphis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>C. E. Dean Riverboat Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>The C.E. Dean Riverboat Collection contains 117 photographs of boats such as the Kate Adams and the James Lee which carried cargo and passengers up and down the Mississippi River during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Included in the collection are detailed descriptions of each pictured riverboat which list such information as the owner of the vessel, when and where it was built, who was its master and the final disposition of the boat.  The C.E. Dean Riverboat Collection also contains issues of the &quot;S &amp; D Reflector&quot; magazine published by the Sons and Daughters of Pioneer Rivermen between the years 1965 and 1972.  In addition to the magazine, an index for the &quot;S &amp; D Reflector&quot; is also included.  Articles on riverboats and river navigation from the Commercial Appeal, Memphis Press-Scimitar and Waterways Journal as well as postcards of boats and waterfronts are also included in the collection.  The C.E. Dean Riverboat Collection provides a great deal of information on the history of Mississippi River transportation and complements the Captain Rees Vernon Downs Papers, which are also housed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Marvin and Mary Bazemore Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S34</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>This inclusive collection of Memphis- and wartime-themed materials was generously donated to the Memphis Public Library by S. Carolyn Bazemore, the presumable daughter of Marvin and Mary Bazemore, in 2005, and for this reason, the collection bears the Bazemores' names.  Both native Shelby County residents, Marvin Bazemore - born July 29, 1903 - a Shelby County Penal Farm worker, and Mary Rogers - born June 17, 1905 - a Cordova schoolteacher, were married on December 2, 1942.  Shortly thereafter, Marvin was drafted for military service in WWII.  Stationed at an army training camp off the coast of Georgia, Marvin was eventually discharged in early 1943 on account of his employment in the Roads and Bridges Department at the Shelby County Penal Farm - considered a matter of national defense.  The greater part of this collection consists of correspondence between Marvin, family members and friends - including Mary - during his stay in Georgia.  There are, however, additional pieces of correspondence between other WWI and WWII enlisted men - presumably friends and relatives of the Bazemores - and their respected loved ones.  At once, these letters and postcards provide an invaluable document of military and civilian life as well as Shelby County society in the early-to-mid 20th century.  The collection also includes: ration books from the WWII era; photographs and records from the Memphis Skeet and Trap Club; family photographs; construction photographs from Marvin's work at the Shelby County Penal Farm; vintage playbills; newspaper clippings; and miscellaneous keepsakes highlighting Memphis history, such as a Memphis Sesquicentennial Celebration pamphlet, which outlines the biographies and historical significance of such influential Memphians as E.H. Crump and John Overton, and a Shelby County Penal Farm pamphlet, which enumerates the various crops and services the Penal Farm historically provided to the Mid-South.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Wolf River Conservancy Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S33</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Wolf River Conservancy was founded in 1985 as a primarily grassroots organization to &quot;conserve and enhance the Wolf River corridor and watershed as a sustainable natural resource.&quot;  Since then, the non-profit land trust has gained will-deserved prominence and admiration in the Mid-South community through its myriad of ecological, recreational, and educational accomplishments that provide widespread benefits to the community at large.  This collection containing newspaper clippings, WRC newsletters, and wildlife literature, donated by Woodrow Jacobs, Kathy Steele, and other nature enthusiasts and WRC supporters from the Mid-South, chronicles the internal development and accomplishments of the conservancy and provides a comprehensive historical background of the natural habitat around Wolf River.  A significant portion of the collection documents the successful campaign to save what is now known as the Ghost River, a section of the Wolf River headwaters, thanks in part to Millington businessman Babe Howard and fundraising efforts of the Wolf River Conservancy.  More than anything, this collection exemplifies that the Wolf River Conservancy is an organization committed not only to the conservation of the Wolf River proper but to the sustainability and betterment of the Mid-South community at large - both people and wildlife.  Through community and educational outreach programs, recreational opportunities, conservation efforts, and environmental advocacy campaigns, the Wolf River Conservancy has proved an invaluable service to the Mid-South community.  In light of the recent plans to construct a 30-mile greenway along the Wolf River - a bridge between not only natural habitats, but also communities in the Mid-South, this collection proves particularly relevant to the future of the Mid-South area.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Frank M. Campbell Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S33</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In 1980, Frank M. Campbell donated approximately 1,100 photographs and negatives of Memphis buildings and street scenes to the Memphis and Shelby County Room.  With few exceptions, the images date from the early to mid-1950s. -- Frank M. Campbell joined the Edward LeMaster Realtor firm in 1947.  Soon after joining the company, he directed a detailed survey of a large area of downtown Memphis.  According to an article in the September 26, 1971, edition of the Commercial Appeal, the National Real Estate Journal described the survey as &quot;one of the most constructive that had come to the journal's attention.&quot;  He later served as the company's vice president, before being elected president of the Edward LeMaster Company in 1971. -- Most images in the collection are of commercial property.  Given Mr. Campbell's real estate background, researchers might assume some of these properties were of possible interest to the Edward LeMaster Company.  The collection contains two albums, with the photographs and negatives listed alphabetically by street name.  Any additional information included with the image at the time it was donated can be found in the finding aid.  Information provided by the processor is written in italics.</dc:description>

<dc:identifier>S34</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Urban Renewal Photograph Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by the Shelby County Archives in 2002.  Culled from the larger Urban Renewal Collection housed at the Shelby County Archives, the Urban Renewal Photograph Collection contains duplicate images of homes and businesses that were demolished or renovated between the years 1959 and 1961.  Funded by the Housing Act of 1949 which provided federal dollars for slum clearance programs, the city's Urban Renewal projects transformed many historic neighborhoods in downtown Memphis, including Court, Railroad, and Jackson Avenues and Beale Street.  Researchers interested in Urban Renewal will also want to consult the Beale Street Development Corporation, Future Memphis, Inc., Henry Loeb and Frank Tobey Collections, also housed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.</dc:description>

<dc:title>E.H. Porter Railroad Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>The E.H. Porter Railroad most likely come to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center through many donations as there is no record of a single individual donating the entire collection.  E.H. Porter (the E. stood for Ethel) was the president of The Memphis &amp; St. Louis Railroad Company from its founding on January 15th, 1857, when it was first chartered, up into the 1870s and 1880s. The collection has a wide and varied collection of documents. This includes personal correspondence between Mr. Porter and state auditors, along with numerous auditing documents, maps, and tax receipts from the business dealings the company had in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. One of the biggest projects that the company performed was the construction of a levee system in Arkansas.  The business dealings that the company also had with other railroads is well documented, and altogether the collection provides an important window for understanding the significance of railroads in both the ante and post-bellum South. Overall the collection of the Memphis and St. Louis Railroad Company as overseen by E.H. Porter provides an essential view in the life and times of the South during a crucial transitional period in United States History.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In March 1929, the Memphis Little Theatre prepared to move into the east wing of the Pink Palace, which had been built for Clarence Saunders but never occupied by him as a home.  This location would serve as the theater's home until 1975, when a state-of-the-art facility opened on Perkins Extended across from Audubon Park.  Plays presented in the early years apparently did not have great popular appeal, and a search was made for a new director who would broaden the scope of the theater's repertoire and attract a larger audience.  In September 1932, a youthful Eugart Yerian came from California to take over the helm of the Little Theatre, where he would successfully lead the organization for 21 years, except for the period from 1939 to 1947 when he was away from Memphis.  In 1961, Yerian left the Little Theatre to become director of visual aids for the Holiday Inns Corporation.  During Yerian's tenure, Memphis Little Theatre was recognized nationally as one of the leading amateur theaters in the United States.  In 1974 the Little Theatre's directors approved a name change to Theatre Memphis for both the organization and its new facility under construction opposite Audubon Park.  A small, experimental theater in the new building retained the name Little Theatre.  Under the direction of Sherwood Lohrey, the new location, finished in April 1975, staged a 30-performance run of My Fair Lady as its opening production.  Materials in this collection were acquired by the Library over a span of years through individual donations and accession from other sources such as the merger of the Goodwyn and Cossitt libraries.  Programs have been arranged in chronological order, and each entry in the collection guide includes play title, director, cast members, and date staged.  Programs range from 1925 - 1975, covering theatrical performances directed by Eugart Yerian, Talbot Pearson, Fred Sears, George Sparks and then Eugart Yerian.  Long time director, Sherwood Lowrey, began his tenure with the 1962/1963.  The programs also provide valuable information on stage sets, production staff, technical aspects of properties, as well as brief notes on the actors' performance history.  Names of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee reveal another significant aspect of the operation of this volunteer theatrical organization.  Lastly, the program advertisements give the reader an interesting glimpse of leading businesses of the period.  The collection provides the student of local theater with an incredible run of theatrical history.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Saul Brown Photograph Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>Saul Brown was born in 1910 in New York to Russian immigrants.  As a young adult, Brown attended Tech High School in Memphis and graduated from the Memphis Academy of Fine Arts with a degree in Fine Art.  Brown served in the Air Force during World War II.  After graduation, he found work with Loew's Theaters, where he created publicity displays.  Brown worked as a staff photographer for the Memphis Press-Scimitar for twenty years, retiring in April of 1980 as the newspaper's chief photographer.  After retirement, Brown continued taking publicity photographs for various Memphis theaters as well as images of public figures, personal friends, and Memphis and its residents.  He received the Freedom Foundation Award in 1972.  In 1986, Brown donated $5,000 to Memphis State University to establish the Saul Brown/Memphis Press Scimitar Award, awarded to students in news journalism and news photography beginning in the 1987-1988 academic year.  In 1987, due to his financial support of the school's academic fund, Brown was granted membership in the school's Presidents Club.  Saul Brown passed away in Memphis on March 13, 1992 at the home of Myron Taylor, the brother of Mildred, his late wife. -- The Saul Brown Photograph Collection includes 33 boxes of color and black and white prints, color and black and white negative and positive film, and color slides.  Dated photographs range from the 1950s to the early 1990s; the bulk of the material dates to the 1970s and 1980s.  Original order has been maintained where possible and is noted in the detailed finding aid where applicable; elsewhere, the items are sorted by subject and year. -- A majority of the photographs in the collection were taken in Europe and Asia during Saul Brown's extensive travels.  Researchers will also find visual documentation of local Memphis theater in the 1980s in the form of publicity photographs, Graceland at the time of Elvis Presley's death, people in the news, and many Memphis businesses, including King Cotton, Burkle's Bakery, Stroh Brewery, and others.  -- Throughout the collection are images which contain insights into Brown's personal life.  Friends and colleagues (including &quot;Saul's Harem,&quot; a group of close female acquaintances) appear repeatedly throughout the years, as do locations throughout Memphis and the surrounding areas.  Overton Square, Graceland, and Brown's home are some common subjects.  Many photographs are dedicated to documenting Brown's many Memphis-area photography exhibits.  These picture some prints not included in the donated collection.  The collection also includes color film of a selection of Brown's paintings and works by other artists.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Memphis Heritage Cultural Resources Survey</dc:title>
<dc:description>Memphis Heritage, Inc., the city's leading historic preservation group, was founded in October 1975.  Some of its major accomplishments include historic building and neighborhood surveys which have helped Memphis preserve and list many structures on the National Register of Historic Places.  These records, which form the Memphis Heritage Cultural Resources Collection, were donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by the organization.  The collection contains field reports and photographs of historic Memphis neighborhoods examined by Memphis Heritage surveyors in 1988-1994 and 1999-2002.  In addition to historic homes, surveyors also compiled information and photographs of all neon signs then on display in Memphis.  Field reports include the property address, owner's name, date of construction, condition of house and architectural style. -- Four neighborhood surveys were compiled and they are designated Cultural Resources Survey (CRS) 1, 2, 3 and Addendum in the index.  Neon sign entries are designated Neon Sign Survey in the index.  The index is organized by street address and includes historic name, common name, the survey number, the box and folder in which the reports and photographs are located, and the number of items and photographs in each folder.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Central Gardens Historic District Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G29</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Central Gardens Historic District is one of the iconic midtown neighborhoods of Memphis, Tennessee. Spanning 83 blocks, nearly 511 acres, and encompassing approximately 1,540 structures, the neighborhood has maintained its present-day appearance for nearly 100 years.  The neighborhood is bounded in the north by the commercial strip facing Union Avenue, Annesdale Park Historic District in the west, the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad in the south, and Rembert Street in the east. -- The most characteristic trait of the neighborhood is its eclectic style. Numerous architectural styles exist including Greek Revival, Bungaloid, and the Prairie Style, but all the houses maintain certain characteristics. No doubt these similar qualities were imposed upon the builders when the structures were composed, mostly between 1905 and 1925. Some of these features include uniform setbacks from the street, cornice heights and massing, and some common details such as front porches, bay windows, and porte cocheres. The area as a whole represents the evolution of American architecture from the 1890s to the 1930s. Even the nature of the structures vary - most buildings are single-family homes, but multi-family homes, churches, stores, and schools exist within the boundaries as well. This variety of buildings creates a strong sense of community within the neighborhood. -- During the early 20th century, when the timber and cotton industries flourished, Memphis' wealthy class grew considerably. These new wealthy professionals sought new real estate, thus birthing many midtown neighborhoods, including the area now known as Central Gardens. By 1925, the area had developed to nearly its fullest extent and looks today very similar to how it looked then. Throughout the decades, the area has been home to some of Memphis' elite, including E.H. Crump, Watkins Overton, and Walter Chandler. After World War II though, the area began to decline and many of its residents abandoned the neighborhood for the east Memphis suburbs. -- Not too long passed before the neighborhood was attractive again, this time to young professionals in the 1960s who liked the spacious houses, shady trees, and low property prices. In 1967 a new neighborhood association formed and they decided to name the area &quot;Central Gardens.&quot; New Orleans' Garden District was the inspiration for the name, as the original association found similarities between the two neighborhoods. Central Gardens quickly developed a strong presence and name in midtown, no doubt ensured by their frequent community events such as annual block parties, a 4th of July parade, and a garden club, all of which still exist today. </dc:description>

<dc:title>Chandler Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S33-S34</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Chandler Collection includes information about various dwellings, lots and commercial properties in Memphis, with materials from 1968 to 2002.  Some items deal with the homes and buildings demolished to pave the way for the proposed construction of Interstate I-40.  Memphians fought the construction, because the interstate would have gone through the heart of the city, destroying Overton Park, the Memphis Zoo, many homes and hundreds of acres of old forest trees.  -- The collection is arranged in individual folders within 9 boxes. Each box contains folders relating to different addresses, properties or areas of Memphis and Shelby County.</dc:description>

<dc:title>NOW - Memphis Chapter Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The National Organization for Women (NOW), a dedicated women's rights advocacy coalition, was founded in 1966, amid much controversy over the proposed direction of the women's rights movement.  In its nascent stages, the national chapter of NOW existed under the platform of equality, adopting a bi-partisan and multi-racial stand with the goal of raising awareness, particularly among women, of the contemporary gender biases existing in both domestic and economic spheres. Still in operation today, NOW boasts over 500,000 members across 500 chapters dispersed among all fifty U.S. states. -- The Memphis Chapter of the National Organization for Women has an illustrious history characterized by, first and foremost, an intense desire to promote gender awareness, dispel existing stereotypes, and rectify the perceived vices of a very much separate and unequal society.  Founded in the spring of 1970 as a result of the gathering of three women at Centenary Baptist Church, the NOW Memphis Chapter wasted no time in diving in to the major contemporary women's rights issues, with the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment being first on the agenda. -- Much like the National Chapter, Memphis NOW focused on several key topics, including child care, marriage, discrimination, economic equality, and victimization.  In addressing the aforementioned issues, the NOW Memphis Chapter wasted little time, with the 1973 Employment Consultant Task Force marking the first of many efforts to further the struggle for women's rights.  Designed to educate and consult with women who have been classified as victims of discrimination at the workplace, the task force aimed at educating the women of their rights, in hopes of preventing such occurrences from repeating themselves in the future by arming them with the legal framework for their defense. -- Action on behalf of the Memphis Chapter of the National Organization for Women was not limited to the designation of a discrimination-focused task force; rather, it encompassed a variety of measures including: the offering of seminars, such as 1974's &quot;55 Things a Woman Can’t Do Under TN Law,&quot; the sponsoring of protests, such as the 1975 Overton Square march against violence toward women and the creation of support centers, exemplified by the organization of the &quot;Battered Women's Crisis Line&quot; in 1977. -- Piggybacking off the success of the aforementioned engagements, the Memphis Chapter of the National Organization for Women gained a notable, albeit not substantial in number, male membership.  The careful nature by which former local chapter president Marion Kiesker asserted the organization's identity as the National Organization for Women, as opposed to the National Organization of Women, underscored her, and others', desire for the inclusion of all people dedicated to their cause, regardless of gender. -- Despite claims to the contrary, many asserted that the Memphis Chapter of the National Organization for Women, and the entire coalition as a whole, suffered from a failure to address the concerns of African-American women.  Critics consistently pointed to the lack of membership among African-American women as an indictment of the organization's focus. -- The Memphis Chapter of the National Organization for Women is still in existence today, and remains a vibrant advocate of gender equality, women's rights, and social progress. -- The National Organization of Women – Memphis Chapter Collection consists primarily of correspondence, news clippings, and issues of the local chapter newsletter.  The collection houses a wealth of information pertaining to the goals, organizational structure, and outreach plans for the Memphis Chapter of the National Organization for Women.  Correspondence to and from former President Marion Keisker, in particular, plays a major role in the collection.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Beethoven Club Programs Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G15</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Miss Martha Trudeau, a piano teacher, couldn't have dreamed of the possibilities when she invited three women to tea on October 27, 1888. They discussed the lack of classical music opportunities in Memphis and they decided to start a club, the Beethoven Club. Then &quot;Miss Trudeau's Quartet&quot; presented a program on December 17, 1889. The following year they presented William Sherwood, a Chicago pianist, at the Hebrew Men's Association home. This concert earned $10.00 profit. -- In 1892 the growing group was incorporated as the Beethoven Club. From the early beginnings the purpose was to encourage the musical talents of members and to stimulate musical interests in Memphis. One requirement for membership was that members had to be performers. Men could become members, but could not hold an office. -- Around 1900 the club outgrew Mrs. Napolean Hill's home and moved to the Women's Building downtown. -- In 1912, under Mrs. Hill's leadership, the club organized the Junior Beethoven Club and this group was followed by the Intermediates and Juveniles. This early commitment to the music education of children and teenagers was an important function of the club's history. -- Fro the 1920-1921 season, the New York Chamber Music Society was part of the concert series. Subscription tickets to 2 of the 4 concerts were $10.00 and single admission tickets ranged from $1.50 to $3.00. -- Great progress was made in 1924 with the purchase of the Lowenstein-Long House on Waldran, the realization of a need for a clubhouse. -- In 1925 the organization began a long partnership of 40 years with the Civic Concert Service. A galaxy of famous performing artists came to Ellis Auditorium, the Goodwyn Institute, the Music Hall and other auditoriums. It was a golden age for touring performers: Enrico Caruso, Walter Damrosch, Mischa Elman, Kirsten Flagstad, Jerome Hines, Fritz Kreisler, Yehudi Menuhin, Birgit Nilsson, Ezio Pinza, Rosa Ponselle, Isaac Stern, Joan Sutherland, the National Ballet of Washington, Marcel Marceau, the Vienna Choir Boys, the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. -- A Student Loan Fund began in 1932. This has helped many students with their music education. Many like Mignon Dunn, who became a leading singer with the Metropolitan Opera, greatly benefited from the loans. -- The Beethoven Chorus for women gave its first concert in 1937 at the Goodwyn Institute with Burnet Tuthill directing. By this year membership had climbed to 652. -- In 1938 a library that included sheet music and music scores was expanding. -- After America entered World War II, the Student Musicians Chorus (directed by J.B. Dishongh) prepared in the summer of 1941 to sing patriotic programs. -- On August 1, 1945, the clubhouse at 217 North Waldran was sold to the Elizabeth Club, an affiliate of the Nineteenth Century Club. The membership was 3,000.  In the years before the next clubhouse was purchased, meetings were held at the Parkview, the Nineteenth Century Club and Grace-St. Luke's Episcopal Church, among other places. -- A Junior Choir Festival was important in the 1950s with hundreds of children from Memphis churches participating. -- A new clubhouse at the northwest corner of McLean and Peabody was purchased in 1952. The many improved features were an auditorium with a capacity of over 175, business offices, a president's office and a director's room. The club moved to its new home in 1953. -- In 1956 the club was a key force for the birth of the Memphis Opera Theatre, and it sponsored the regional Metropolitan Opera auditions starting in the 1960s. -- Many organizations face fluctuations in their history and certainly the Beethoven Club was no exception. By 1972 the membership had fallen to around 700. -- For over 120 years, the Beethoven Club has been enriching the musical life of Memphis and is likely the oldest music club in Tennessee. Many other clubs have vanished into history, but the little endeavor of Trudeau and her friends lives on to encourage the talents of young performers and enhance the cultural life of the city.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Edwin D. Thompson Trolley and Streetcar Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S4-S5</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Edwin D. Thompson, Sr. was born in Memphis in 1918.  An Eagle Scout and Silver Beaver Award recipient, Thompson served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and worked as a sales manager for an agribusiness company.  But it was his passion for model railroad building that led Thompson to collect information and photographs related to streetcar and trolley operations in Memphis.  A member of the Circus Model Builders Association and the Mid-South Society of Model Engineers, Thompson was an authorized Lionel Train Repair Station for over 30 years until his death in 2008. -- The Edwin D. Thompson Trolley and Streetcar Collection provides researchers with a great deal of information on the operation of the Memphis Street Railway Company and its rival Citizens Street Railway during the late-19th and 20th centuries.  The collection also provides information on the re-introduction of trolley service in Memphis in the late-1980s and 1990s.</dc:description>

Douglass History
The Douglass community is a neighborhood in north Memphis, loosely bounded by the Wolf River to the north, the Illinois Central Railroad on the west, Jackson Avenue to the south and Highland Street on the east. A combination of several subdivisions, the area is sometimes referred to as the Douglass – Bungalow – Crump neighborhood.
Founded as the Douglass Park subdivision in 1907 by Reverend W.A. Plummer, a former slave known as “Father” Plummer, the neighborhood drew residents displaced by burgeoning white communities, the yellow fever epidemics which plagued the Memphis area in the late 19th century, and the disintegration of the plantation-centric agrarian system. Named for Frederick Douglass, the settlement was conceived as an all-black community and has remained so ever since. The neighborhood is renowned for its high home ownership rates and its strong sense of community spirit.
The community pride Douglass is known for developed early in its history. During the devastating years of the Depression, the community learned how to serve and provide for one another. Community gardens, home improvement contests and sewing committees made sure that no resident went without necessities. In 1937, the year that Eleanor Roosevelt toured the neighborhood, the community produced 100,000 cans of food for residents and another 5,000 for the Douglass School.
Schools and churches have always been the backbone of the Douglass community. The first Douglass School was a Rosenwald school, funded by Julius Rosenwald’s Fund to provide quality education for African-American children in the early 20th century. By the mid-1930s, a junior high had been added and Douglass High graduated its first class in 1946. Upon annexation to the city of Memphis in 1950, Douglass High School was incorporated into the Memphis City Schools. Closed in 1981 due to a declining student population, the school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The school building was torn down in 2006 to make way for a new Douglass High School, which opened its doors in 2008. As for churches, the community boasted at least 13 different congregations by 1940. That number has grown steadily during the years since.
Douglass Park has also played a huge role in the lives of Douglass’ residents. Created in 1913, Douglass Park was the first park for Memphis’ African-Americans and served as a central gathering place for most social and recreational events. It has played host to summer camps, sports leagues, community reunions, golfers and the city’s annual Juneteenth celebration.
The lasting spirit and pride of this community has been showcased over the years with reunion events (including the Douglass Expo) and publications. For more information about the history of the Douglass community, please see:

Scope &amp; Content
The Douglass Oral History Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room by Nancy Jane Baker of the Memphis Landmarks Commission in March of 2011. In 2004, the Memphis and Shelby County Division of Planning and Development set out to create a neighborhood plan for the Douglass community. As part of the planning process, planners conducted surveys and interviews with community members, with the oral history interviews being retained in this collection. Containing materials from 2004 and 2005, the collection provides a comprehensive record of an oral history project, from planning stages to the final product.
The collection retains its original filing structure, with Box 1 comprised of planning documents, neighborhood research materials, resources from an environmental justice workshop and interoffice correspondence about the project. Box 2 houses the transcripts and other documentation from the oral history project participants. The original cassette recordings are housed in Box 3.
Researchers interested in oral histories will also want to consult the Everett R. Cook Oral History Collection and the Selma S. Lewis Collection. Those interested in neighborhoods should also consult the Central Gardens Historic District Collection, the Memphis Heritage Cultural Resources Survey, Papers of the Raleigh Community Council, Peabody-Bellevue Civic Club Collection, Evergreen Historic District Association Collection, and Memphis Civic Clubs – Jackson Boulevard and Rozelle Clubs collections, located in the Memphis and Shelby County Room of the Memphis Public Library and Information Center.
Single photocopies or scans of unpublished writings in these papers may be made for the purposes of scholarly research.

<dc:title>Peggy Jemison Neighborhood Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>S5-S7</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Peggy Jemison Neighborhood Collection contains material related to the history of the Annesdale Park, Beale Street, Bethel-LaBelle, Cherokee, Cooper-Young, Greenlaw, Smokey City, South Main, and Vollintine-Evergreen neighborhoods. -- In 1977, Dr. Peggy Jemison Bodine joined a project sponsored by the Metropolitan Inter-Faith Association (MIFA) and the Tennessee Humanities Council to research the histories of eight endangered Memphis neighborhoods.  For four years she intensely researched several local neighborhoods, and that work culminated in the publication of &quot;A History of the Cooper Young Neighborhood,&quot; &quot;Cherokee: A History of Change,&quot; &quot;Greenlaw Rediscovered: A History,&quot; and Vollintine/Evergreen: A Diverse Community.&quot;  The research material Dr. Bodine collected for the MIFA project and included in the Peggy Jemison Neighborhood Collection is invaluable for those interested in studying the history and development of Memphis neighborhoods.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Edward LeMaster Downtown Real Estate Survey Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Edward LeMaster Downtown Real Estate Survey Collection contains four property survey books and a card file index that gives a history of property ownership and tenant occupancy in downtown Memphis in the mid-twentieth century.  Prepared by Edward LeMaster Company, each property survey book also includes a narrative which analyzes the conditions of downtown real estate. -- Edward Bennett LeMaster founded his firm, which specialized in commercial and industrial properties, in 1944.  Frank M. Campbell joined the firm in 1947 and he was appointed president of the company in 1971.  Both men and their company contributed greatly to the commercial development of Memphis in the second half of the 20th century.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Oliver - Finnie Company Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B6</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>In 1860, J. P. Finnie arrived in Memphis on the Silver Moon steamboat and opened a small retail grocery at Main Street and South Court.  In 1868, Finnie entered the wholesale business.  He partnered with J. N. Oliver, forming the Oliver-Finnie Company, and moved to a new location on Front Street.  In 1903, the company began its manufacturing department, naming their product line &quot;Silver Moon,&quot; after the Steamer that brought Finnie to the city. -- The company moved to their final location at 7 Vance Avenue after a fire destroyed their plant in 1904.  Oliver-Finnie manufactured 515 different varieties of candies, ranging from hand-dipped chocolates to hard candy sold in 20 quart pails for plantation commissaries.  They also roasted and ground their own coffee blend, and added their label to the baking powder and flavoring extracts they packaged.  The business operated continuously until 1961, at which time it was liquidated to settle the estate of Maynard Holt, the company's last president and major stockholder. -- The collection consists of one photograph album of images taken at the company's manufacturing center and colored advertisements of the company's product line.  These images date to the early 1900s.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Parker Automobile Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>When automobiles began to be produced, Jerome Pillow Parker recognized the possibilities.  In 1901, the Jerome P. Parker &amp; Company purchased six high-seated steam locomobile runabouts known as the Mobile.  He sold the last of these in 1903.

<dc:title>Richard Halliburton Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>Richard Halliburton, born on January 9, 1900, in Brownsville, Tennessee, was a well-known adventurer and travel author.  The family later moved to Memphis.  While attending Princeton University, Halliburton developed an interest in travel and travel writing.  His first book, The Royal Road to Romance (1925), quickly became a bestseller.  All of Halliburton's following books proved to be immensely popular.  For over a decade, his exploits were featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world.  His last adventure proved fatal.  He commissioned a Chinese junk, the Sea Dragon, and attempted to sail across the Pacific Ocean from Hong Kong to San Francisco.  After nearly three weeks at sea, the ship encountered a typhoon.  The ship was last in contact on March 23, 1933, and Halliburton was declared legally dead by the Memphis Chancery Court the following October. -- The collection consists of one scrapbook produced by H. A. Bruno - R. R. Blythe and Associates, a Public Relations Counsel in New York City. The scrapbook is titled &quot;The Flying Carpet, Halliburton - Stephens, 1931 - 1932.&quot;  The newspaper clippings in this album date from February to July, 1932.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Tom Lee and M. E. Norman Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>On May 8, 1925, members of the Memphis Engineers Club, their families and guests, took two ships, the Choctaw and the M.E. Norman on a day trip to view a levee revetment project approximately twenty miles south of Memphis.  On the return trip, the M.E. Norman capsized at Cow Island Bend.  As fate would have it, Memphian Tom Lee, returning home from Helena, Arkansas, passed the M.E. Norman moments before the accident.  He quickly turned his 28-foot skiff, Zev, around and began rescuing the struggling passengers.  Tom Lee, who could not swim, acted without regard to his personal safety, made multiple rescue trips, and even stopped to start a fire for the survivors.  He continued the search for the ship's survivors and victims throughout the night.  Tom Lee saved thirty-two people that day, quickly becoming the city's hero.  Eight days after the disaster, Lee met President Coolidge at the White House.  The Memphis Engineers' Club raised enough money to purchase him a house at 923 Mansfield Street.  The City provided Lee with a job for life with the Sanitation Department, and even arranged for a generous early retirement.  Tom Lee died of cancer on April 1, 1952.  Two years later, the City renamed Astor Park &quot;Tom Lee Park&quot; in honor of one of its greatest heroes. -- The collection consists of newspaper clippings and other materials, previously compiled into an album, focusing on Tom Lee and the sinking of the M. E. Norman.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Joe Bennett Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Joe Bennett Collection consists of 5 boxes donated by local businessman Roy Good in 2003.  The collection is comprised of three photograph albums and one scrapbook belonging to Joe Bennett.  It is possible that one of the albums belonged to his sister, Lena, whose family is the subject of several of the collection's photographs.  Lena Bennett married Howard Boaz in 1912, and the couple had two children: Howard, Jr. and Thomas 'Bennett'. -- Box 1 contains the photographs from the first album, Box 2 the photographs from the second, and the third album is divided between Box 3 and Box 4.  Box 5 contains the pages from Joe Bennett's scrapbook, which focuses on the Fairground Casino Ballroom from 1930 through 1950. -- With few exceptions, the photographs and scrapbook pages are maintained in the original order of the albums.  Most of the photographs were taken between 1912 and 1916 and feature Mr. Bennett's friends and family, including Frank Pole and brothers John and Alonzo 'Lonnie' Bennett.  The collection also includes photographs of places of interest in the Memphis area.  This finding aid includes an index which focuses on these Memphis areas.  Photograph captions from the original album are listed in quotation marks.  Notes from the processor are in italics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Charles A. McVean U.S. Engineers Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>Charles A. McVean, a native of Missouri, was a concrete engineer, notable for his work in the navigation channel on the lower Mississippi River.  McVean studied engineering at the University of Colorado.  In 1934, he began working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Memphis Engineer District, where he served as a concrete engineer and also as assistant chief of the district’s Inspection Branch.  He conducted numerous studies on the casting of concrete mattresses, which are used in revetting the banks of concave bends along the Mississippi River.  In the early 1960s, the results of one study earned McVean a nomination for a Presidential citation.  

In 2000, Charles D. McVean donated the Charles A. McVean U.S. Engineer’s Collection to the Memphis Public Library &amp; Information Center.  The collection consists of four boxes spanning 2.5 linear feet.  Box One contains concrete laboratory reports, experiment logs, various studies, maps, and guides.  Boxes Two through Four contain photographs of levee work in the Memphis Engineer District from the 1940s to the early 1970s.  These photographs focus on the areas of Hickman, Kentucky; Richardson’s Landing, Tennessee; Cates Landing, Tennessee; Caruthersville, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; Helena, Arkansas; and Cessions, Mississippi. </dc:description>

<dc:title>J.B. Mann Suffrage Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G9</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The J.B. Mann Suffrage Collection cannot be classified as a primarily biographical collection due to its wide coverage of women’s suffrage. However, Mrs. Martha E. Allen (also referred to as Mrs. J.D. Allen) plays a large role in the collection. She was born on November 16, 1851 in Plymouth, Indiana where she later attended girls’ schools and married Jacob Davis Allen. Her dedication to women’s suffrage began during the 1870s when she saw Susan B. Anthony speak at a rally. However, she was living with her father-in-law at the time and he did not support women’s suffrage so she did not fully engage in suffrage activities until 1889, when she and her husband moved to Nashville. In 1898 they relocated to Memphis where an Equal Suffrage Association was founded in 1904, which Allen promptly joined. Unfortunately, the Association soon failed due to lack of funds. 
This was not the end of her involvement with women’s suffrage as proven by her role as the first president of a small group called the Equal Suffrage League, which was founded in 1906. She served as president until 1912. During this time she worked to organize the women’s suffrage movement throughout the state of Tennessee. These efforts included countless parades, rallies, pink teas, flying of flags, and rummage sales. Her efforts paid off and she earned the honor of being called the grandmother of the Memphis League of Women Voters. 
She was also involved in numerous other clubs including the Ladies’ Hermitage Association, Women’s Christian Temperance Union, Daughters of 1812, Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Nineteenth Century Club. She eventually retired from public life due to illness during her last years and died at the age of eighty-seven on November 12, 1936.</dc:description>

<dc:title>John Ford Canale Collection</dc:title>
<dc:description>Born in 1917, John Ford Canale was a lifelong native of Memphis, Tennessee.  As a child, he attended Immaculate Conception parochial school, the Pentecost-Garrison School, and Christian Brothers High School before attending Southwestern. After graduation Canale went to work for Spencer-Sturla Funeral Home where he quickly rose to the position of President. In 1942, he engaged and married Dorothy Eugenia Stoltzenberg.  The couple had six children and remained together until his death in 1982.  After serving as a military intelligence officer during World War II, Canale returned to Memphis and enrolled in the old Southern Law School, which would later merge with the Memphis State Law School. -- Canale quickly became involved in politics when he campaigned for Senator Kenneth McKellar in his 1952 losing bid for the United States Senate.  This campaign was only the beginning of Canale’s involvement in Tennessee and Shelby County politics. His political career began in 1956 when he was appo</dc:description>

<dc:title>W.C. Handy Beale Street Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>B10</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>On November 16, 1873, the “Father of the Blues” was born in Florence, Alabama. At an early age, William Christopher Handy showed an interest in music, and by the age of ten, he could already read sheet music.  Although his parents wanted him to become a minister, Handy set out to become a professional musician, heading to Birmingham in 1892. While in Birmingham, Handy spent time teaching and working in a factory. Meanwhile in his free time, Handy worked to hone his craft playing with several small bands. -- In his youth, Handy played with a number of different bands, which travelled all across the South, but he finally landed in Memphis, Tennessee. He quickly found work and popularity in Memphis when he wrote and performed “Mr. Crump” for E. H. Crump’s mayoral election campaign in 1909. Handy would later rename and rewrite this song with the more famous title “The Memphis Blues.” -- After receiving moderate success from this composition and others, Handy began collaborating with Harry Pace. While Handy wrote the music, Pace wrote the lyrics.  The two would eventually go into business together more formally when they established the Pace and Handy Music Company. Originally based out of Memphis, the two would publish a number of songs before they moved the company to New York City, including the aptly named “Beale Street Blues.” -- While in New York, Handy led the effort to popularize the blues. Based at 1650 Broadway, Handy and Pace published numerous compositions that would be featured in shows on Broadway. Even after Pace left the business, the Handy Brothers Music Company continued publishing compositions. By the time of his death on March 28, 1958, Handy was widely recognized as a music legend across the country.
While he was not the first person to publish blues compositions, Handy was integral to the popularization of the blues with the publication of numerous compositions. Today he is still remembered as the “Father of the Blues” for his work. -- The material contained in the W. C. Handy Beale Street Collection was donated from a number of different sources, including items donated by Mrs. Roy Collins and Bob Crowder.  Because the Collection was compiled over a period of several decades from many different sources, the collection was organized logically rather than in the order that they were received. -- The W. C. Handy Beale Street Collection contains numerous compositions by Handy, including “The Memphis Blues,” “St. Louis Blues,” and “Beale Street Blues.”  In addition, the collection also holds several other compositions that were not composed or published by Handy, including Danny Thomas’ “Bring Back Beale Street.” The collection also houses letters, speeches, articles, and pamphlets that honor the life of W. C. Handy.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Beale Street Blue Light District</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>N5</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The “Blue Light District” of Beale Street is the name given to the section between Second and Fourth Avenues.  After being recognized in The National Register of Historic Places, it became necessary to preserve the buildings in the area.  However, the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation required the Memphis Housing Authority (MHA) to suspend all redevelopment activities pertaining to the district until an architectural-historical analysis could be completed.  

In November 1973, the Memphis Housing Authority partnered with the firm of Architect-Engineer Associates, Inc., from Nashville, Tennessee, for not only an analysis, but a complete photographic inventory and economic feasibility analyses in connection with individual building rehabilitations.  This project was financed through a grant from the Housing and Urban Development Department.

An onsite inspection took place from December, 1973, to February, 1974.  The photographs from this project, taken by Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., are available in the Beale Street Blue Light District Collection.  The textual information can be found in The Blue Light District of Beale Street – Memphis, Tennessee, an Architectural and Historical Survey for Memphis Housing Authority, which can be found in the Memphis and Shelby County Room, Memphis Public Library &amp; Information Center, under the call number 711.409768 A673b.
      
The collection includes two photograph albums, spanning 2 linear feet.  The photographs include captions, thought to have been written by Architect-Engineer Associates, Inc., from Nashville, Tennessee.

<dc:title>Emma K. Meacham Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G29</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Emma K. Meacham Collection consists of one box spanning one linear foot.  The collection contains Mrs. Meacham’s “Sketches,” stories she shared with her granddaughter as she reminisced about her life.  These sketches were transcribed by longtime Library volunteer, Virginia Battle.

In this collection, Emma Koen Meacham, 1869-1952, described the early history of Memphis, with notable mentions of the Lee Line of Steamers, the Kate Adams, and President Grover Cleveland’s 1887 visit to Memphis.  Memphians Sara Beaumont Kennedy and Robert Looney are also mentioned.  Outside of Memphis, she recalled her time as one of the first students to attend Belhaven College in Jackson, Mississippi.  She also described in vivid detail the 1897 flooding and levee breech of Laconia Circle in Desha County, Arkansas.

	Mrs. Meacham was the wife of William Walker Meacham, a planter in Laconia Circle, Arkansas.  Together they had two children, Chlotilda Louise Meacham Rechenburg and William Earl Meacham.

<dc:title>Pearl Harbor Survivors Association Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>G8</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Pearl Harbor Survivors Association was founded after eleven survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack gathered in Gardena, California, on December 7, 1954 to remember their friends and fallen comrades.

Pearl Harbor Survivors Association Collection
Historical Sketch
The Pearl Harbor Survivors Association was founded after eleven survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack gathered in Gardena, California, on December 7, 1954 to remember their friends and fallen comrades. The reunion became an annual event, and the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association was officially founded in 1958 and recognized by the United States Congress in 1985. This organization includes members who were at or in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941.
Today, membership is slowly decreasing as most of the members are well into their nineties. The Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors was founded on December 6, 1965, in response to the eventual expiry of the Association and continues to increase awareness and provide scholarship funds.
The Tri-State Pearl Harbor Survivors Association has included veterans from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas and was chartered on December 7, 1968. Since 1996, Mr. Howard G. Lee has served as President and before that as Secretary-Treasurer. Today, there are only three members remaining of this chapter, and they celebrated their last official meeting in December 2011.

Biographical Note
Gwen R. Awsumb braved uncharted waters in Memphis municipal politics. She emerged during a crucial time in both national and local history, serving as the only female member of Memphis’ first mayor-city council during the Civil Rights Movement. She witnessed the tension of the Sanitation Workers Strike, grieved the loss of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., rallied for the fluoridation of public water, and fought incessantly for her constituents. Gwen was among the first generation of moderate Republicans to gain political clout in Memphis. She fought political, social, and racial obstacles with her status as a white, female Republican. Her determined spirit inspired a new attitude of cooperation between municipal leaders and the citizens of Memphis. She valued the progress and urban development of the city. She respected her fellow council members and believed that improved relations between white and black communities were crucial to the betterment of Memphis.
Gwendolyn Van Court Robinson was born on September 25, 1915 in Marshall, Michigan. Her father was a native of LaGrange, Illinois, while her mother was born in Natchez, Mississippi. In 1930 at the age of fifteen, her family moved to Memphis as a result of personal financial hardship. Supported by family and friends, Gwen was able to graduate from St. Mary’s Episcopal School in 1932. She then attended Southwestern (now called Rhodes College) where she majored in Chemistry, pledged Kappa Delta, and graduated in 1937. Although pursued by two men, Gwen was ultimately charmed by Wells Awsumb, a future member of George Awsumb &amp; Sons and the architect of Clough Hall at Rhodes College. The young couple married in December 1937. Wells completed his graduate degree in architecture at the University of Illinois in 1940 and was the only person in his senior class to pass the Architectural State Board exam.
Together they had three children: George (1939), Carl David (1942), and Helen Catherine “Cathy” (1947). After a short stint in New Orleans from July to November 1941, Wells and Gwen relocated to Athens, Alabama. Wells served in World War II for eighteen months, and Gwen returned to Memphis to live near relatives. The family was finally reunited and moved to Forest Avenue in 1950. Gwen began working for the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee in 1956 at the request of Bishop Barth. She devotedly attended Calvary Episcopal Church and became active in the YWCA.
Gwen’s interest in politics started with her involvement in the voters’ registration effort through the YWCA. This innocent endeavor led to political fervor, action, and passion. She campaigned for General Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election. She co-chaired the Orgill Campaign for the Memphis school board and served on the City Beautiful Commission. The Republican party convinced her to run for a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives 3
in 1956 as a “guinea pig”. Yet Gwen’s campaign surpassed expectations. Eight candidates out of a large field were elected and she finished ninth.
For Gwen, the legislative campaign was merely a stepping stone for future political ambitions. After a large town hall gathering at Ellis Auditorium, she was one of twenty five persons selected for a charter committee. This committee lobbied for a mayor-council form of government. Their proposal was passed in 1966 by the City Commission with a narrow 3-2 vote. In the spring of 1967, Gwen represented the District Two seat of the newly-created Memphis City Council. She was the only woman of the 13-member body. Her success as a council member continued; she served as Chair of the City Council in 1970. In 1971, her election to an at-large seat on the council attested to her growing popularity across the city. Although considered a viable candidate for mayor, Gwen opted for a new avenue and accepted Mayor Wyeth Chandler’s appointment as the city’s director of the Department of Housing and Community Development in 1975. She performed this role until her retirement in 1981. Gwen’s commendable political career serves as a testimony to her devotion, integrity, and fortitude.
In addition to politics, Gwen also served numerous organizations with distinction. Some of her roles included Chair of the Memphis and Shelby County Bi-Centennial Commission, Secretary of the Program of Progress Committee (POP), and board member of the YWCA, the Episcopal Church Home, Theatre Memphis, and Les Passees. She was also a member of the Tennessee Board of Regents and the Memphis Book Club. Her interests were as diverse as her contributions were unique. She supported arts, education, and church outreach.
In her memoir, Gwen recorded her honorary doctorate from Rhodes College in 1976 as her finest hour. This doctorate recognized Gwen’s inspirational contributions as both a civil servant and city leader. In 1996, St. Mary’s Episcopal School named Gwen the recipient of the Distinguished Alumnae Award. Gwen R. Awsumb died in 2003 leaving a legacy of awsumbness.

<dc:title>Ronco Spaghetti Company Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>V1-2</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Ronco Spaghetti Company originally began in 1926 as the business endeavor of Italian immigrant John S. Robilio. Several years later, Ronco became a local partnership between Robilio and Thomas Cuneo. The name Ronco cleverly combines the “RO” of Robilio and the “CO” of Cuneo to form a fitting title. Mr. Robilio imported the finest durham and semolina wheat for his pasta products which included elbow, spaghetti, and macaroni noodles. The company also served as a local importing and distribution center for the Memphis region until 1961. Although Mr. Robilio died in 1929 before the height of Ronco’s success, the operations were continued with the oversight of his son Albert Robilio and family. -- The company thrived after World War II as it expanded its consumer base across the Southeast. Soon, Ronco pasta and noodles were featured on the display aisles at many of the main grocery stores including Kroger, A &amp; P, Winn Dixie, Piggly Wiggly, and Super Stores. The insightful sales managers sought to develop a strong brand identity via advertisement. Utilizing many nuanced marketing and advertising strategies of the twentieth century, the Ronco Pasta label appeared daily on city buses and decorated the highway with colorful billboards. In 1938, the first large transit ad of the area featured the company. Ronco was proud to call itself a local, independent enterprise. It relocated from its original address on 124 N. Front Street (now the current site of City Hall) to a larger, more comprehensive site on 800 S.  Barksdale Avenue in 1972. This location enabled the company to expand its manufacturing site and increase production quality. The process for producing pasta requires efficient machinery and expert skill. First, the grains must be stored in large barrels. Next, the product is pressed into its desired shape and lastly dried to achieve the best results. -- The Ronco Company worked extensively with advertising agencies and promotional companies, distributing coupons in the newspapers and offering weekly specials on select products. These strategies were evidently successful; in 1978, the Memphis Press-Scimitar reported that 13,000 tons of pasta were produced, generating sales of approximately $10 million. In 1981, Ronco was managed by an outside party for the first time. L.M. Anderson served as the general manager and L.P.A. Giannini (Tony) worked as the assistant manager. These managers remained loyal to the founding families’ vision, vowing to maintain independence despite pressure from greedy conglomerates in the food industry. Despite this vision, the Ronco Company was sold to food giant Borden Inc. who proceeded to close the pasta plant in the late 1980s. Although the Ronco Pasta brand is now externally owned and sold nation-wide, its economic contribution to the Memphis community cannot be denied.</dc:description>

Scope and Content
The Ronco Spagehetti Company Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library and Information Center by J. S. ‘Jay’ Robilio Jr. in 1993. His donation contained five boxes of photographs and promotional material pertaining to Ronco. This collection comprises one half of a linear foot in addition to four complete photo albums equivalent to one foot.
The Ronco Spaghetti Company Collection is primarily a visual, photographic collection of Ronco’s business endeavors. These photos catalog over forty years of Ronco success ranging from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Some photographs are in black and white while others are in color. Most photographs contain a detailed description indicating the date, location, and content of the photo, but several photos are obscure and unidentifiable. The photos carefully document Ronco inventory displays in grocery stores, as well as machinery and equipment used in the factory. Several photos capture the employees, managers, and bosses conducting daily business.
This collection mainly features promotional strategies relating to Ronco. There are several examples of business correspondence with advertising agencies and newspapers, as well as a business contract with Hunt’s Tomato Paste. Promotion pamphlets, brochures, certificates, and newspaper clippings all attest to the company’s profitability and prestige. As a member of the Greater Memphis State, Ronco Company was nominated by the Memphis mayor and Shelby County commissioner to submit an excerpt to a historical book called A Metropolis on the Nile: An Illustrated History of Memphis and Shelby Co. published in 1982. Included in this collection is correspondence between the Ronco managers and the editor, in addition to various drafts of Ronco’s biographical insert.
Researchers interested in the history of privately owned Memphis businesses should also consult the Firestone Collection, the Goldsmith Collection, and the Piggly Wiggly Collection. Researchers should also consider the papers of the Oliver-Finnie Company and the South Memphis Land Company.

Awsumb Architectural Collection
Biographical Note
George Awsumb
George Awsumb became a nationally-recognized architect for his prize winning designs of the Market House Auditorium (Ellis Auditorium) and Idlewild Presbyterian Church, both located in Memphis. His contributions were in the traditional Classic design with regal ornamentation, making George a noted architect of the Gothic church construction in the South. George defined architecture as “frozen music” made for the “man on the street” (The Egyptians, 1941 April 17). Indeed, his designs created a visual symphony and continues to mesmerize viewers.
George was born in Skein, Norway in 1880. At the age of four, his family moved to America and settled in Whitewater, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Wisconsin and studied engineering for one year. His family then relocated to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and George entered the building trade and began constructing massive barns. Later in life, George reflected that his experience building barns led to his successful career in church and public building design. There was a great similarity between the basic principles of the two structures (Commercial Appeal, 1959 November 25). He studied for three years at the University of Illinois and worked for two years in Chicago at various architectural firms. While in Chicago, he won the Chicago Architecture Club’s traveling scholarship.
Once George complete school, the scholarship transported him to Europe. Touring England and France on a bicycle, George was first exposed to the Gothic European cathedrals. He returned to Chicago and taught for one more year at the Art Institute. Again, he went abroad to examine more thoroughly the great cathedrals. On this second trip, George decided to specialize in the design of public buildings. In 1915, he married Ella Wells, a native of Beatrice, Nebraska and daughter of D.O.O. and Marie McConnell Wells. Together the couple had three children: Wells (1915), Georgiana (1918), and Richard (1919).
In 1919, George came to Memphis at the request of Charles O. Pfeil, a prominent Memphis architect. Pfeil invited him to co-enter a competition for the design of the Market House Auditorium. They won the competition and created a partnership called Pfeil &amp; Awsumb that lasted until 1929.
George continued to design buildings for another forty years. After Ellis Auditorium, Pfeil &amp; Awsumb designed the Dermon Building (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and Ildewild Presbyterian Church (second place at the Christian Herald National Competition). 3
After parting with Pfeil in 1929, George opened his own firm called George Awsumb. He later renamed the firm to George Awsumb &amp; Sons in 1946. After a long, distinguished career, George died on November 24, 1959.
Wells Awsumb
Wells Awsumb was born on October 28, 1915, the eldest son of George and Ella. He was an architect in Memphis for thirty-five years. He attended Southwestern (now Rhodes College) where he met his future wife, Gwendolyn Van Court Robinson. Gwen and Wells married in 1938 and had three children: George (1939), Carl David (1942) and Cathy (1947). Wells graduated from the University of Illinois in 1940 with a degree in architecture. He was the only person in his senior class to pass the Architectural State Board exam (Gwen R. Awsumb Collection).Upon graduation, he served eighteen months in World War II. Shortly after the war, he returned to Memphis to become partners with his father and brother in the firm George Awsumb &amp; Sons. In 1963, he was president of the Memphis chapter of American Institute of Architects. He also served as chairman of the C.M. Gooch Foundation Board and was a member of the Kiwanis Club.
Some of Wells’ signature designs include Theatre Memphis, Clough Hall at Rhodes College, and Lindenwood Christian Church. Despite these achievements, Wells preferred painting in watercolor. Once retired, Wells became an active watercolorist.
Richard Awsumb
Richard was born on August 4, 1919. He was George and Ella’s second son and youngest child. Like his brother, Richard also graduated from University of Illinois with a degree in architecture. He served four years in World War II and returned to Memphis to join the family firm. He married Kathryn Gibson and had three children: Richard Jr., John Kenneth, and Rebecca.
Carl David
The youngest son of Wells and Gwen Awsumb, Carl continued the Awsumb name in Memphis architecture. He attended Auburn University and married Priscilla Ann “Pan”. Together the couple had two children, Sarah and Matthew. In 1975, he joined the family firm renamed to Awsumb/Associates/Architects. After Richard and Wells retired in 1981, Carl changed the firm’s name to Awsumb, Wage, &amp; Watson. This firm existed until 1989, when Carl established his own private practice.

Awsumb Architectural Collection
Historical Sketch
The Awsumb Architectural Collection contains sixty years of architectural projects and designs from the 20th century that characterize the city of Memphis today. This multi-generational collection captures the artistic vision of the Awsumb architects and verifies their valuable contributions to the city’s progress and development. George Awsumb, the first Awsumb architect, defined architecture as “frozen music” designed for the “man on the street” (The Egyptians, 1941 April 17). Indeed, this Memphis architect, his two sons Wells and Richard, and grandson Carl re-shaped the traditional Classic design for Memphians, providing residences, churches, schools, theaters, and an auditorium for the public to enjoy. By examining the many original drawings, such as Ellis Auditorium, Idlewild Presbyterian Church, and Clough Hall on the Rhodes College Campus, scholars can now seek to understand the relationship between the architectural style of the Awsumbs and the “man on the street.”
George Awsumb arrived in Memphis in 1919 at the request of Mr. Charles O. Pfeil, a prominent Memphis architect interested in entering a design competition for the Market House Auditorium. After winning the competition, George stayed in Memphis and continued to design buildings for forty more years. He parted ways with Pfeil in 1929 and began to design public buildings, specifically church buildings. Some of his exemplary designs include the Dermon Building, several campus buildings for LeMoyne Owen College, First Presbyterian Church in Osceola, Arkansas, local Young Women’s Christian Association buildings, and the Baron Hirsch Synagogue Worship Center.
In 1946, after completing their respective service in World War II, Wells and Richard Awsumb joined their father in forming the George Awsumb &amp; Sons firm, making an impressive team. Notary designs completed by this firm include the Bruce Hall for LeMoyne Owens College, First Methodist Church, the Idlewild Presbyterian Church Youth Center, and South Side High School. George Awsumb died in 1959. He was nationally recognized for his prize-winning designs of Ellis Auditorium and Idlewild Presbyterian Church and acclaimed in the South for his Gothic church designs.
Wells and Richard continued the firm and designed the Episcopal Church Home for Girls, Otey Memorial Chapel, First Church of Christ Scientist, Clough Hall at Rhodes College, and Lindenwood Christian Church. In 1975, Well’s son, Carl David Awsumb, joined the firm and the name changed to Awsumb/Associates/Architects. Significant designs during this period were the Memphis Police Station renovations, Babcock Gallery, St. Philip Episcopal Church, and noted residences.
Upon the retirement of Wells and Richard in 1981, the name changed once again to Awsumb, Wage &amp; Watson. Carl continued the Awsumb name in Memphis architecture, designing celebrated buildings such as the Children’s Theatre, the Church of Jesus Christ of 6
Latter-day Saints on Walnut Grove Road, and several office buildings and residences. Awsumb, Wage &amp; Watson continued to exist until 1989, when Carl Awsumb established an independent practice.

Awsumb Architectural Collection
Scope and Content
Comprised of approximately 8 linear feet, the Awsumb Architectural Collection was donated to the Memphis Public Library &amp; Information Center in 1997 by Carl Awsumb. This collection spans the years 1921 to 1986, three generations (George Awsumb, Wells Awsumb, Richard Awsumb, and Carl Awsumb), and five firms (Pfeil &amp; Awsumb “PA”, George Awsumb “GA”, George Awsumb &amp; Sons “GAS”, Awsumb/Associates/Architects “AAA”, and Awsumb, Wage, &amp; Watson “AWW”). There are 80 total boxes in the collection; 79 contain architectural drawings, blueprints, brownprints (reproductions), structural and mechanical sketches, topographic surveys, and floor plans. These documents include ink on linen and paper, pencil on tissue paper and tracing paper, brownprints on plastic, and blueprints; project types range from new structures to additions and renovations. The last box in the collection contains 51 oversized drawings of the Auditorium Market House building.
The Awsumb Collection is divided into four series by date of project: Series I from 1921-1950, Series II from 1951-1970, Series III from 1971-1990, and Series IV Oversized.
The drawings are organized chronologically by building; all related buildings and structures, even those with different project numbers, are stored in the same or sequential box.
For example, all projects concerning LeMoyne College are grouped together as well as South Side High School, Idlewild Presbyterian Church, and First Methodist Church. Those interested in examples of Memphis architectural firms should consult the George Mahan, Jr. Collection. Those interested in more information about the Awsumb family should consult the Gwen R. Awsumb Collection.

Memphis Architectural Collection
Historical Sketch
The Memphis Architectural Collection is a diverse compilation of architectural designs that were constructed in Memphis and Shelby County throughout the 20th century. Various classifications of buildings including businesses, residences, hospitals, hotels, theaters, social clubs, and buildings that provide public services are featured. This collection represents the rich heritage of Memphis as it evolves from a trading port on a bluff of the Mississippi into a vibrant metropolitan city of the 21st century.
Starting in 1900, Memphis began to flourish as a city. Attractions such as Overton Park and the Memphis Zoo emerged. In 1904, the Parkways were constructed in a quad-like pattern to surround Overton Park. Talented designers and architects found themselves working in Memphis; some of the earliest firms featured in this collection include Hanker &amp; Cairns, Walter W. Ahlscharlger, Jones &amp; Furbringer, and James B. Cook. Ornate, luxurious hotels such as the Peabody Hotel, the Gayoso Hotel, the Chisca Hotel, and the Chickasaw Hotel are all results of this grandiose era. Various businesses, such as Memphis Steam Laundry, Lowenstein’s Department Store, the E.H. Crump building, the Memphis Royal Crown Bottling Co., and the Pantaze Drugstore all reflect the industry, investment, and enterprise of downtown Memphis.
This collection contains nearly 60 designs from the Hanker &amp; Cairns architectural firm. After studying in Paris, Bayard Snowden Cairns arrived in Memphis in 1904 at the request of his cousin R. Brinkley Snowden to be the superintendent of the Memphis Trust Company (later known as the Bank of Commerce and Trust Company). He established the firm Hanker &amp; Cairns in 1907. He and his associate William Julius Hanker are credited with the classical designs of the Chisca Hotel, the Nineteenth Century Club, the Chickasaw Hotel, the Marx and Bensdorf building, and various renowned residences. They were also the associate architects for the Peabody Hotel. Their firm continued until 1934.
Arguably the most famous Memphis attraction, the Peabody Hotel was reconstructed in 1925. Walter W. Ahlschlarger is praised for its notable designs. The hotel resembles an oversized Spanish hunting lodge, complete with a Travertine fountain and a grand mezzanine. Born in Chicago in 1887, he studied at The Lewis Institute of Technology, in addition to attending The Armour Institute and The Art Institute. Today, the celebrated Peabody Hotel stands regally on Union Avenue, still luring guests with its traditional duck march, Art Deco Skyway, and rooftop pavilion.
Another key firm featured in the collection is Jones &amp; Furbringer. Max H. Furbringer served on the City Planning Commission, the City Board of Adjustment, and the Memphis Housing Authority. He was also a highly active member of the American Institute of Architects. 3
His associate Walk C. Jones, Sr. was born in Memphis in 1874. His tour of Europe and the Middle East influenced his architectural preference for the Moorish, classic style. Some of their notable works include the Jewish Hospital and the Oakville Sanatorium Children’s Building. Walk C. Jones, Jr. later joined the firm in 1930. A photographic compilation of their residential designs can be found in Box 62.
Overall, this collection strongly reflects the diverse interests of Memphis. The city values artistic expression as is evident with the blueprints of the Majestic Theatres, the Memphis Theater, Crump Stadium, and the Levitt Shell. This white concrete orchestra shell was first constructed in 1936 as a product of the Works Progress Administration. Beginning in 2008, it now offers free outdoor concerts for the general public to enjoy. The collection even includes blueprints from the Historic American Buildings Survey, a New Deal program designed to preserve historically significant buildings and provide employment to architects. The Tennessee State Capital Building, the Hermitage Home, and the Goyer-Lee Home are all documents from this endeavor.
In addition to cultural attractions, public service has also been a consistent priority for Memphis. The drawings of the Shelby County Court House, Linden Station, Memphis River Terminal, the Shelby County Insane Asylum, and the Shelby County Penal Farm all attest to the city’s growth and development. The construction of hospitals, such as B’nai B’rith Home and Hospital for the Aged, Methodist Hospital, and Oakville Sanatorium affirm Memphis’ dedication to medical services. Although this collection contains many blueprints, it is important to note not all of these structures remain in physical form. These structural designs, along with plans for prominent Memphis residences and notable publications about architecture, complete the Memphis Architectural Collection.

SCOPE AND CONTENT NOTES
GERALD AND BARBARA DOWDY COLLECTION
The Gerald and Barbara Dowdy Collection was donated to the Memphis and Shelby County Room in January, 2013 by G. Wayne Dowdy. Comprising one 2 ½ inch box, the collection contains letters written by Gerald McLain Dowdy to his wife, Barbara Ann Nance Dowdy, and his parents John and Lucile Dowdy while he was on active duty with the Tennessee Army National Guard from October 1960 to July 1963. Also included in the collection are a letter and postcard to Barbara Ann Nance Dowdy from Myra Gale Brown Lewis, wife of rock ‘n’ roll performer Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as photographs and other miscellaneous items. The Gerald and Barbara Dowdy Collection provide a fascinating glimpse into the life of a soldier during the Cold War years of the early 1960s. The letters chronicle many of Dowdy’s day-to-day activities during Basic Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and while he was on active duty at Fort Campbell, Kentucky and Fort Stewart, Georgia.
Gerald M. Dowdy was born on October 17, 1942 in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Moving to Memphis with his parents during World War II, Dowdy joined the Tennessee Army National Guard’s 3rd Battalion, 115th Field Artillery Regiment, 30th Armored Division in July 1960 after graduating from Whitehaven High School. Achieving the rank of first sergeant, he served on active duty at several posts including Camp Shelby in Mississippi and Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Later he served in the Army Reserve where he was awarded the Army Achievement Medal. In a letter to his wife written in July, 1963 he described a typical day in an artillery regiment: “I fired 61 rounds at the forward position, the others fired 88 rounds. We went tactical at 1700 (5:00 PM) today and will be tactical until tomorrow at 1700. Tactical means no lights (I’m using a flashlight to write by)...no noise, wearing helmet, gas mask, rifle, canteen, first aid pouch and raincoat. Well, the capt. just came in and said to turn out my light.” Barbara Ann Nance Dowdy was born in Ripley, Mississippi on July 3, 1943 to William Herbert and Lurline Griffin Nance. As a young girl Barbara Nance Dowdy relocated to Memphis where she graduated from South Side High School in 1962. In addition to raising her sons Gerald Wayne and William Johnathan, Barbara Dowdy worked as a legal secretary for 24 years before her death on November 8, 2010.
Researchers interested in the Cold War and Memphis during the 1960s will also want to consult the Jerry Lee Lewis, Everett R. Cook Oral History, John William McAfee, Hunter Lane, Jr., Marvin and Mary Bazemore and Memphians during War collections which are also housed in the Memphis and Shelby County Room.

Received your letter a few days ago. Also received a letter from Tommy on Thursday. Friends are staying at the Hotel Lawtonian this weekend.

Received a letter from Mama yesterday and Thursday. Hope both of you are getting to work.
Marched in a parade honoring the commanding general of the fourth army. Did real well, so our Captain let us have today off. Picked up passes after five. Eight of us came into town and rented a room in the nicest hotel. It cost $4.59 a night for a nice single room with bath and a free radio. Didn’t go to the field yesterday because of snow and iced over roads. Going to rent a car with five more boys in which to come home. It’ll be faster and more comfortable than a bus. Or you could come out here and pick me up and we could look around. I’ll pay the expenses. Talk it over and tell me what you think.

Sorry I haven’t written, but I’ve been busy. Received three letters yesterday and one today. Glad to get your letters and enjoyed talking to you Saturday night. A buddy and I agreed to stay out here, so we would not have to take down the big tent. Tomorrow is our last day in the field. Have 101 rounds to fire. It’s been raining two hours, not hard but steady. Still haven’t found my money. It seems like I just can’t get ahead, but as long as I have you, I’m satisfied.
It won’t be too long before I’ll be home. One of the officers got struck on the boot by a snake, but it didn’t hurt him. Some of the mosquitoes out here are big as half-dollars. I’ll close and go to bed to try and get some sleep. Please don’t forget me. (No envelope.)

<dc:title>Memphis Park Commission Minute Books</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>V3-V7</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Memphis Park Commission met for the first time in September 1900. Its final meeting took place nearly a century later in March 2000, and in April it was abolished by the Memphis City Council. The Commission customarily met once a month, although at times meetings could be held on two or more successive days. At the other extreme, several months might pass (especially in late summer) without a quorum being present. The frequency with which meetings took place over the years was, in a word, irregular.-- During its tenure the Commission was made up of at least 47 Commissioners (one serving twice), of whom at least 16 served as Chairmen. Some Chairmen may be perceived as being more forceful or involved than others. It seems likely that successive Park Commission Secretaries (also numbering at least sixteen) smoothed over the occasional behavioral quirk or contentious issue as they compiled the minutes. This is to say that, as reflected by the minutes, the Secretaries seem to have striven to be informative and impartial. -- In addition to the actual accounts of meetings, during certain periods the Secretary or staff or Chairman inserted material that was bound into, or pasted or glued to, or simply inserted between pages of, the minutes. Such material is sometimes not where it belongs chronologically; nevertheless for the most part this paperwork will be found as the Park Commission Secretary left it. Indeed, some of this material may be considered more significant than the minutes themselves, although always being related to the Commission’s concerns. It should also be observed that, especially in the 1970s and ‘80s, there are occasional errors in page numberings, as well as other problems affecting the continuity of the minutes.</dc:description>

Notes on the Scope and Contents of the Memphis Park Commission Minute Books, and on Using This Collection
The Memphis Park Commission met for the first time in September 1900. Its final meeting took place nearly a century later in March 2000, and in April it was abolished by the Memphis City Council. The Commission customarily met once a month, although at times meetings could be held on two or more successive days. At the other extreme, several months might pass (especially in late summer) without a quorum being present. The frequency with which meetings took place over the years was, in a word, irregular.
During its tenure the Commission was made up of at least 47 Commissioners (one serving twice), of whom at least 16 served as Chairmen. Some Chairmen may be perceived as being more forceful or involved than others. It seems likely that successive Park Commission Secretaries (also numbering at least sixteen) smoothed over the occasional behavioral quirk or contentious issue as they compiled the minutes. This is to say that, as reflected by the minutes, the Secretaries seem to have striven to be informative and impartial.
In addition to the actual accounts of meetings, during certain periods the Secretary or staff or Chairman inserted material that was bound into, or pasted or glued to, or simply inserted between pages of, the minutes. Such material is sometimes not where it belongs chronologically; nevertheless for the most part this paperwork will be found as the Park Commission Secretary left it. Indeed, some of this material may be considered more significant than the minutes themselves, although always being related to the Commission’s concerns. It should also be observed that, especially in the 1970s and ‘80s, there are occasional errors in page numberings, as well as other problems affecting the continuity of the minutes.
Before they were disbound, all minute books except Book 1 consisted of heavy-duty archive-type covers with three lockable binding posts containing up to 500 of 8 ½- by 14-inch pages (that is, 250 sheets of paper) punched with three holes. In Book 1, on the other hand, the sheets of paper were folded and sewn together in true book form, yielding 400 pages (of which only 357 have been used). The book has not been taken apart, but it has been photographed. Because it is still intact, the various portions of Book 1 are described here in its Inventory as “Sections” (each spanning a decade), rather than as “Folders” containing disbound pages.
A review of the various parts of this finding aid may be helpful. Table I summarizes the features of the Minute Books and lists the period of years each book covers, book sizes, the extent to which the minutes are enhanced (or burdened) by additional matter, and whether or not they are indexed. Table II is a list of photocopied indexes that are provided in Box 28 for the convenience of the researcher, making it largely unnecessary to consult the originals in their nearly two dozen separate archive boxes. Tables IIIa and IIIb summarize and date the appearances of the names of some of the Park Commission’s acknowledged facilities over the period 1906-1941, as they are listed in budgets, audits, reports, and the like. 6
The Container List of Minutes of the Memphis Park Commission is probably self-explanatory. Each of the Minute Books (including the still-fully-bound Minute Book 1, as described above) is found in its own archive box, from Minute Book 1 (Box 1) through Minute Book 22 (Box 22). However, the later minute books are of irregular length and their contents have been distributed into boxes for which the book numbers and archive box numbers no longer coincide. An Inventory as well as an Introduction and Excerpts have been prepared for each of the 29 books, as well as Inventories for a set of cassette tape recordings (see below) and for the set of photocopied indexes listed in Table II.
The paragraph introducing each of the 29 Inventories includes a short note about the various types of minute-related material present in each book, material that is almost always adjunct to the minutes and included because the Secretary or others felt it should be bound in or pasted in or simply inserted between two pages. The Inventories are intended to assist in locating information about audits, budgets, lists of employees, and the like (dealing with finances or fiscal matters in general, including fees, rentals, and other uses of Park properties), as well as references in later years to Capital Improvement Projects (CIPs). There may well be overlap between items mentioned in both a book’s Inventory and its counterpart Introduction and Excerpts.
Any organization is likely to evolve greatly over the course of a century. Some of the more obvious or significant changes noted during the processing of the minute books have been tracked, and are summarized in the Introductions to the 29 successive books. Among these are changes in the Commission’s membership and senior staff and the attendees at its meetings, its bidding and billing practices, references to its audits, budgets and financial situations, its accounting practices, its establishment or adoption of new parks or other venues, significant issues that it dealt with or were forced upon it, and the relations between the Commission and the City of Memphis. Note that the Commissioners comprise what is sometimes referred to in the minutes as “the Board.” The accompanying Excerpts are intended to showcase both the large concerns as well as the ephemera that the Park Commission attended to, and to provide some continuity in the stories of its more significant enterprises – the development of the Zoo or the Fairgrounds, for example, or the Clarence Saunders or Lichterman properties, or Mud Island.
A number of cassette Tape Recordings were made of Park Commission meetings during the period 1988 through 1994; there are also a few such recordings from 1997 as well as eight others whose recording date has not been identified. The recordings that have been auditioned are not of very good quality, and only a few have been authenticated as having been made during the meetings they claim to record, i.e. the date written on the cassette. It remains to be seen whether future research may prove any of these attributions false. As mentioned above, Photocopies of Indexes to the minute books (those that have been indexed, or for which indexes have been preserved) have been provided for the greater convenience of researchers.
The size of the Park Commission increased many-fold during its hundred-year existence. The minutes show that in Feb. 4, 1919, 13 named staff members were paid monthly salaries. No laborers are mentioned, although laborers there certainly were; one of the accounting categories in a Dec. 7, 1904 audit was “Statement of Cash belonging to laborers 7
not called for up to date,” naming 25 men to whom small sums of money were owed. By Jan. 1, 1931 park employees numbered 199, and the list now includes named laborers and truck drivers, as well as “watchmen, maids, grass mowers, &amp; keepers . . . of Small Parks.” By Nov. 1, 1951 the number had risen to 245 names; and by Feb. 17, 1992 the Park Commission was informed that there were 426 full-time employees and 44 vacancies. In addition to names, many of these lists fortunately include duties, and salaries or wages. References to such lists, as well as lists of Commissioners and Commission officials and their terms of office, are collected into Appendix 1, providing glimpses of the men and women who led and staffed the Park Commission during its historic hundred-year run. Appendix 2 is a compilation of sources for the history of the Commission that will be found close to hand in the Memphis and Shelby County Room, including the Commission’s own publications from its first decade.
A final special note is required to define the number of “Items” enumerated for each folder in this collection, although this may only be of peripheral or bookkeeping interest to users. Most such “Items” are defined as the dated Minutes of a Park Commission meeting, or indeed even a dated notice that e.g., for lack of a quorum no meeting was held, or that it was postponed or canceled. Minutes themselves, or such a “lack of quorum” notice, will almost always be signed by both Chairman and Secretary. These “Items” will usually include supporting documents such as audits, budgets, bids, blueprints, letters, internal reports and memos, as well as City Commission or City Council approval of Park Commission proceedings, acquisitions or appropriation requests, etc., even though such material may not always bear the same date as the minutes they support. Other “[Items.]”, preceded by this underlined and bracketed label in the Inventories, are notable documents or ancillary material relating to the Park Commission, its staff or its activities; they may be more or less independent of the specific minutes where they are found. The total number of “Items” in each folder is thus the sum of the number of meetings held during a calendar interval (along with their supporting documents), plus the other “[Items.]” as labeled separately. It should be noted that occasionally late in Book 6, in Book 7 throughout, and in the earliest part of Book 8, “bids received” for work or products often appear on their own individual pages and usually were entered into the minute book, dated and signed in, as it were, by both Chairman and Secretary. However, these are not considered to be individual “Items” as defined above, unless it is clear that a quorum of Park Commissioners was also present when these bids were received and considered. If extensive sets of bids appear, sometimes amounting to 20 pages or more as occurs in Books 15 and 16, some of them may have been labeled as “[Items.]”.
Single photocopies or scans of unpublished writings in these papers may be made for purposes of scholarly research.

Memphis Park Commission Minute Book 1
(September 13, 1900 – December 13, 1910):
Introduction and Excerpts
The newly appointed Memphis Park Commission of September 1900 consists of Judge Louis B. McFarland as Chairman, Robert Galloway and John R. Godwin; later in the decade John T. Willingham and Dr. Benjamin F. Turner will replace McFarland and Godwin respectively. Each is required to post a bond of $5,000, equivalent to about $135,000 in 2012, “conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties.” The original Commissioners waste no time getting down to business. At their second meeting they begin discussing the purchase of land to create two major parks, one to the south and one east of the city, and not long afterward the acquisition of land to connect the two with a parkway. For such large projects, funds will be raised by bond sales, limited by statute at the time to no greater than $250,000 each. By their second year the Commission acquires Overton Park, and shortly thereafter hires landscape architect George E. Kessler (designer of Kansas City’s much-emulated park and boulevard system) to design something similar for Memphis.
As the minutes begin, they are written in a fine legible hand (with occasional exceptions) and continue thus for more than seven years. Typed copies of first letters, then bills, then resolutions, cut-out newspaper notices of bids, etc. begin to be pasted (or glued?) into the minutes beginning as early as September 29, 1903. The first location where the complete minutes of a meeting are typed throughout appears to be March 27, 1907. However, these minutes are not typed onto the pages of the minute book, but are pasted onto its pages in the same manner as bills are. Handwritten minutes resume for several months, but as of April 15, 1908 typed pasted-in minutes become the norm. Near the end of the book, headings appear in red and the text in blue.
Lists of bills incurred by the Commission begin to appear regularly in the minutes by the end of 1901, sometimes as often as once a month, and continue through Books 1 and 2 and into the early years of Book 3. By about July 10, 1905, the lists of bills are typed and pasted onto the pages. The format for payment approval is along these lines: “On motion the following claims were allowed and the Secretary instructed to draw checks for same,” or the even simpler “The following bills were approved and ordered paid.” This form also continues throughout Minute Books 1 and 2 and part of Book 3. As indicated, bills are paid with checks, which are listed in the minutes with the payee’s name and the amount of the check; thus on November 8, 1901, the minutes record the check of $110,000 to Overton Lea for land that will become Overton Park.
Few references are seen to salaries and fewer, if any, to payrolls, a practice that continues for years. The first audit of Park Commission financial records appears in the minutes of December 7, 1904, but audits are not prominent features of Book 1. On November 7, 1906, Chairman Godwin reports on receipts and expenditures during his term of office and includes a rudimentary budget, and Chairman Galloway gives a similar report on October 2, 23
1907. An audit for 1908 appears on February 12, 1909 and one for 1909 on December 22, 1909; it may be noted that in the former, in a section on Park Commission Disbursements, there are references to salaries and maintenance costs for parks.
It is clear that the Commission has a bidding process, in which bids are invited for products, services, concessions, construction and the like, although the methodology may not be clear. A bid “for Overton Pavillion stand privileges was submitted by H.S. Hughey” and “Under advertisement the following bids [for paving] were submitted” on August 10, 1903. Some of the early bid notices are cut out of newspapers and pasted into the minutes, for example one inviting bids for “furnishing Music for the Memphis Parks for the season of 1905” (April 11, 1905) or for “furnishing drain pipe under Parkway between Riverside &amp; Overton Parks” (May 17, 1906). A special called meeting is held June 19, 1908 “for the purpose of opening and awarding bids for the erection of a pavilion at Riverside Park.” On January 18, 1910, “The matter of awarding bids for the construction of the comfort station in Court Square was taken up . . . Inasmuch as there was only one bid offered for this work
. . . this bid was declined.”
As mentioned above, Chairman Godwin submits a budget in November 1906. Commission properties named there are Auction Square, Bickford Park, Confederate Park, Gaston Park, Market Square, Overton Park, Riverside Park, and the Speedway (part of North Parkway). Two years later another audit adds to this list Brinkley Square (the re-named Market Square), Forrest Park and Overton Park Zoo.
In addition to acquiring land, the Commission finds itself providing construction, caretaking and police services, as well as entertainment. As its component parks and parkways are cleared and planted, buildings are constructed and custodians hired by the Commission. Soon after Kessler designs Overton Park, a superintendent is overseeing its landscaping. Bridges must be built, as well as houses for the “Keepers” of Overton and Riverside Parks. Minutes refer to “park policemen” in gray uniforms and helmets. During the summer, music is provided from Riverside and Overton Park pavilions, and at other locations, by a band numbering up to two dozen musicians.
There are problems to be addressed where park meets city. Telephone and telegraph poles and their wires along the edges of parks and parkways are “inexpedient,” the Commission believes, and it forces companies to remove these eyesores, or tries to. The topic of railroad crossings on the eastern parkway comes up repeatedly. The Commission also works to provide or improve public access to the parks by encouraging the construction of streetcar lines and stations, and indeed the building of streets themselves to poorly-accessible Riverside Park. The acquisition of land for the Parkways becomes a long-drawn-out process, giving one Commissioner what he calls “considerable worry.” Not all park land is used as parks; Astor Park is for years leased to a coal company (which later also causes Commissioners considerable worry).
Once the zoo is established it becomes one of the Commission’s dominant enterprises. Animals are donated by the public or purchased with Commission funds or with monies raised by benefit events, and improved housing is provided from time to time for both inhabitants and their Keeper. 24
Toward the end of the Commission’s first decade, representatives of the tax-paying African-American community begin to petition for equal provision of park services, such as children’s playgrounds and equipment, band concerts, and indeed a park of their own, which the Commissioners go on record as favoring. These requests, sometimes backed by members of the white establishment, are taken under advisement, sometimes with the explanation that sufficient funds are not available at the time but that when they are, the requests will be reconsidered.
In late 1910 comes a letter that clearly takes the Commissioners by surprise. Newly elected Mayor E.H. Crump writes to them that, just then, Memphis had enough parks, and that funds are needed for furthering construction of other facilities rather than expanding the park system.
Excerpts from Minute Book 1:
Page 2, Nov. 7, 1900: The city’s Legislative Council is requested to condemn land “on the east bank of the Mississippi River.” (Although some of the landmarks mentioned here are no longer familiar, this may have been land that would become Riverside Park.)
Page 7, Feb. 6, 1901: Discussion of bonds; it is resolved that “one of members of the Commission go to the Money Centres and try to negotiate the sale of $250,000 Park Bonds or less, and report back.”
Pages 10-11, Nov. 8, 1901: An accounting of Park Commission expenses includes Check No. 7 of $110,000 to Overton Lea for 337 acres of land (i.e., the future Overton Park).
Page 13, Dec. 28, 1901: The Commission names Riverside Park, Gaston Park, Forrest Park and East Park. Civil Engineer James B. Hildebrand is asked to “make a topographical survey of the several Parks with maps and drawings to be done as preliminary to final plans of landscape architect.”
Page 24, July 25, 1902: It being “one of the pleasing duties of grateful posterity to perpetuate the name and memory of its illustrious ancestors,” the Commission decides to rename East Park after Judge John Overton.
Page 28, Nov 5, 1902: Secretary A.G. Booth is instructed to take no rental less than $3,000 per annum for Astor Park.
Page 30, Dec. 3, 1902: The Commission has notified Mr. Arch McCarver, who claims a house in Riverside Park, to remove it within 30 days. However, &quot;as we understand the house has been infected with Small Pox we leave it . . . [to the County Physician] to take such action . . . as to him may appear just and proper for the protection of all concerned.&quot;
Page 41, July 24, 1903: It is “inexpedient” to have telephone or telegraph wires alongside Forrest Park; the Secretary is therefore “directed to request both Telephone Companies and the Memphis Consolidated Gas &amp; Electric Co. to remove any poles or wires they have 25
on the Park side of the street.”
Page 42, Aug. 8, 1903: The Commission receives &quot;A petition from J.M. Hickey asking remuneration in the sum of one hundred &amp; fifty dollars for [a] building in Riverside Park destroyed by the Commission, Petitioner claiming to have brought said building from Arch McCarver.&quot; Rejected.
Page 52, March 9, 1904: Superintendent Frank G. Knight is instructed “to put Golf links in Overton Park.”
Page 53, April 7, 1904: Prof. Wm. Saxby, Jr. is hired to give concerts in the summer, his band “to consist of Eighteen first class musicians . . . clothed in neat uniforms. . . . The object being to give the Citizens in every section of the City the benefit of the Music as far as practicable.”
Pages 62-72, Dec. 7, 1904: An audit by Edward S. Elliott, “Auditor and Accountant,” includes a “Statement of Cash belonging to laborers not called for up to date.” It names 25 men to whom small sums of money are owed; the smallest amount is $0.15, the largest $3.75. The audit mentions payrolls for Overton, Gaston, Forrest, Bickford and Riverside Parks.
Pages 82 and 83, June 7, 1905: &quot;A Communication from Mr. F.D. Fuller protesting against forbidding negroes (and especially his servant) from passing through Forrest Park was read. Considerable discussion was had with reference to the instructions of the Chairman in this matter, and it was determined best to instruct the policemen at Forrest Park to preserve order, and to use discretion in ejecting objectionable characters and do such other work as the Commissioners directed, but not to prohibit the passing of negroes through the Park. This action to apply to all parks.&quot; &quot;Resolved, That the Park Commission favor the establishment of a Zoo, but on account of the limited finances of the Board it does not feel able at this time to promote it, but tender a piece of ground in Overton Park, fronting on Poplar Street about Midway between Cooper and Trezevant Avenues on which is located an old house, for a Zoo Garden.&quot; The resolution passes.
Page 99, Nov. 8, 1905: Commission declines to establish a zoo and will “dispose” of the animals already donated.
Page 108, Feb. 7, 1906: “The question of hunting in the Parks was then discussed and finally referred to Mr. Percy Finley [sic for Finlay] the Parks Attorney to draw up an ordinance for passage inflicting severe punishment for violation of same.”
Pages 111-113, March 7, 1906: A letter from Chairman Godwin to the Commission deals with “acquiring the right of way on the connecting Boulevard from Overton to Riverside Parks.” He and Mr. Percy Finlay estimate the cost of acquiring frontages and removing houses will be $12,500. “This estimate does not include Zion Cemetery, which is said to contain, in the ground we would need, about 2,000 graves. Therefore, I think for the present we had best make a jog in the boulevard at this point and go around it.”
Page 118, April 4, 1906: At the prompting of Commissioner Galloway and citizens’ petitions 26
containing “over 2000 names,” a zoo department is established and an appropriation of $1,200 made per year for maintenance of the animals.
Page 135, July 5, 1906: The name of Market Square is changed to Hugh Brinkley Square. Commissioner McFarland resigns.
Pages 138 and 139, Oct. 5, 1906: John T. Willingham attends his first Park Commission meeting as the newest Commissioner. (Willingham’s record-setting service on the Commission would last until 1933.) The following resolution is spread upon the Minutes: &quot;Whereas Judge L.B. McFarland declined reelection as a Park Commissioner, be it Resolved that the thanks of this Board are tendered to Judge McFarland for his six years of faithful service and especially for the valuable legal counsel and direction which he so freely and graciously gave. Same was duly and unanimously concurred in.&quot;
Pages 153-155, March 27, 1907: Commissioners Galloway and Willingham report going into personal debt to a bank to pay bills for maintaining the parks. The Commissioners disagree on how to handle forthcoming bills.
Page 179, Oct. 2, 1907: A benefit ball game played Aug. 18, 1906 between the Business Men’s Club and the Merchants and Cotton Exchange teams raised $3,638.85, sufficient to buy an elephant, a tiger, a leopard, and one pair each of elk and buffalo for the zoo, and to pay their freight to Memphis.
Pages 190-191, Dec. 9, 1907: “It was ordered that all the Park Policemen be furnished with new gray uniform and with helmet” and proposed that the new pavilion at Riverside Park “be constructed with the latest and best workmanship . . . at a cost of $5600.”
Page 198 and 199-200, March 4, 1908: Commissioner Willingham reports that he had the stomach of the bear “Natch” analyzed after its death “and was advised that it had died of poison.” (“Natch” was the first, and for a time the only, animal in the zoo.) A reward of $100 is offered for the arrest and conviction of the poisoner. A long report describes improvements recently made to the parks and parkway – South Parkway and North Parkway, Court, Brinkley and Auction Squares, Confederate Park, Overton Park and Overton Park Zoo, Forrest Park, Gaston Park, and Riverside Park. “A new and much longer row of hitching posts” has been installed at the zoo.
Page 211, May 6, 1908: Commissioner Godwin is still working to secure a right-of-way for the Parkway on Trezevant Avenue east of Overton Park. He says that he “had made no progress since his last report, that the matter had given him considerable worry.”
Page 215, June 3, 1908: The Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has been requested “to remove its poles off the parkway at various places, but . . . had refused to comply with such request.” The Board’s attorney has informed Commissioner Galloway that “we have a right to remove anything on our parkway”; Galloway is in favor of cutting the poles down if they are not removed, and other commissioners are in agreement.
Page 223, Sept. 9, 1908: M.V. Link (sic for Miles Vandahurst Lynk, M.D., graduate of 27
Meharry Medical College, 1891; founder of the University of West Tennessee and Dean of West Tennessee Medical College) and Julia A. Hooks et al. petition for an appropriation of three month’s rent “for the use of the University of West Tennessee Campus and the purchase of play-grounds apparatus for the colored children to be installed at said colored school campus.” The petition is referred to Mrs. T.M. Scruggs, President of the Play-Grounds Committee. [The Susanne Conlan Scruggs Collection in the Memphis and Shelby County Room contains photos, correspondence and other records of Mrs. Scruggs’ work on behalf of disadvantaged people of Memphis.]
Page 224, Sept. 14, 1908: Mrs. Scruggs states that the Play-Grounds Association offer the petitioners “every encouragement in their undertaking, but that the petition would more properly come before the Board of Education or the City Council.” The Commission entrusts Chairman Willingham with the “delicate task” of replying and saying that the Park Commission “has no money applyable for that purpose and no authority to use any portion” of its funds outside of the parks and parkways.
Page 231, Nov. 11, 1908: The Memphis Automobile Co. has proposed to sell the Commission an automobile for the use of the Superintendent, and he is “authorized to purchase said machine, viz: . . . one model 10 second hand 1908 Buick Runabout, complete with full equipment of lamps, horn, etc.”
Page 236, Dec. 17, 1908: Commissioner Galloway has received a request from the J. Harvey Mathes Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy to erect a flagpole in one of the parks that would have “at its top a small United States Flag and under this a large Confederate flag.” He has advised their representative that “in his opinion the government would not permit this.”
Page 252, April 7, 1909: The ordinances just passed by the city’s Legislative Council “providing rules and regulations governing the parks, parkways, etc.” are spread upon the minutes. They govern speeding on the Speedway, use of vehicles and horses in the parks, theft or injury of park plants, etc.
Page 265, May 22, 1909: “Upon the request of the Mayor of Pensacola, Fla., the Superintendent was authorized to ship him a pair of squirrels, if he found that they could be spared.”
Page 270, June 9, 1909: The park on the riverfront between Monroe and Union Avenues is named &quot;Chickasaw Park.” The Band will play at Overton Park on Saturdays and Sundays, Court Square on Monday and Friday nights, Riverside Park on Tuesday, Bickford Park on Wednesday, and Gaston Park on Thursday.
Page 272, June 24, 1909: The Legislative Council of the City of Memphis resolved on June 19, 1909, that Astor Park property “be turned over to the custody, care and control of the Park Commissioners as park property.” The Pittsburg Coal Co. “now occupy the premises.”
Page 281, July 13, 1909: A $1,000 appropriation is approved for the purchase of a pair of ostriches, and Zoo Superintendent Reitmeyer will go to Little Rock or Hot Springs to select 28
them. Electric lights are to be installed in the two Riverside Park pavilions and at the dancing pavilion in Overton Park. $25,000 is appropriated for building “a carnivorous building and an elephant house at the Zoo.”
Page 285, Aug. 5, 1909: J.A. Omberg, Jr. will build the Carniverous and Elephant Buildings at the Zoo for $24,403, &quot;less the iron work, cages, etc. which was awarded to him for the sum of $3097.00.&quot;
Page 290, Sept. 16, 1909: “A petition signed by a great number of colored citizens and tax payers of the City asking the Commission to establish a park for the colored citizens; also a petition signed by a number of white citizens endorsing the colored citizens petition for a park, etc. were read . . . Also Mayor Malone, upon invitation, addressed the Board favoring the establishment of such a park.” Chairman Galloway “felt the Board would consider the matter favorably whenever sufficient funds were available.”
Page 295, Nov. 4, 1909: Automobile speeding on the Parkway is a common problem. Commissioner Willingham is therefore “authorized to purchase one motorcycle and six stopwatches and to arrange for the detection of parties violating the speed limits.”
Page 299, Nov. 24, 1909: The Commission sends a letter to Chas. B. Quinn, Potentate of the Shriner’s Al Chymia Temple, thanking the Shriners for their recent gift of a camel to the zoo; “She is a beauty (from a camel standpoint) . . . May all her troubles be little ones.”
Page 319, March 8, 1910: &quot;COLORED PARK. Mr. J.N. Ford appeared before the meeting and offered certain tracts of land as shown by blue prints which . . . were designated as tracts #1 containing about 328 acres, tract #2 containing about 180 acres, and tract #3 containing about 70 acres&quot; for which he asked $425, $500 and $800 per acre respectively. &quot;The chairman stated that the Commission would take these propositions under consideration and as soon as possible would inspect each tract after which they would give him an answer.&quot;
Page 323, April 7, 1910: The Commission notes “encroachment of the River” along the bluff.
Page 332, June 15, 1910: “The matter of purchase of a site for a colored park was taken up.&quot; Several sites would be inspected on June 18 by the Commission, attended by &quot;the entire City Commissioners, as well as a representative of each of the daily newspapers, Mr. Tutwiler, President of the Memphis Street Railway Co., and Dr. A.B. Curry, Pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church, who has been very active in furthering the project.”
Page 336, July 16, 1910: A person saying he represented his neighbors in White Haven appears before the board to protest against “a negro park being located in their section. The broad question of establishing a negro park was then taken up and Mr. Willingham stated that after a careful estimate of what would be required to complete the work for which the bonds were issued, it was found that there would not be sufficient funds available to purchase ground for such a park, though each of the Commissioners were on record as favoring it.” The matter will be held in abeyance until such funds became available. 29
Pages 339-341, Aug. 17, 1910: &quot;Mr. Pfeil of the firm of Shaw and Pfeil appeared before the board and exhibited plans of aquaria that he had prepared at the instance of Mr. Willingham, which he explained. After Discussion, Mr. Turner moved that these aquaria be constructed and that Shaw and Pfeil be authorized to prepare plans and details for same. Seconded and Carried.&quot; Messrs. Morris and Bro., upon &quot;offering to reletter the Jackson statue for $30.00, and to place plinth under the bust for $25.00,&quot; are directed to do so. The Business Men's Club calls attention to the fact &quot;that the old historic Bell Tavern had been condemned by the Building Inspector, and asking that the Park Commissioners acquire and re-erect same in Riverside Park.&quot; The Secretary is directed to write the Club that this was a matter &quot;out of the province of the Park Commissioners.&quot; Mr. Willingham and the Superintendent &quot;spent an afternoon with several gentlemen who were golf experts and enthusiasts, locating links in Overton Park . . . all were of the opinion that when completed, that no prettier links could be found.&quot; The Superintendent was instructed &quot;to construct the links as laid out at the earliest moment.&quot;
Pages 343-345, Oct. 10, 1910: Mr. Davis, Superintendent of Small Parks, asks for instructions about dealing with dogs in Court Square; Mr. C.H. Land representing the SPCA formally complains that &quot;dogs had been recently killed by the keeper in Court Square while chasing squirrels in the park. He admitted that dogs and squirrels could not both be permitted in Court Square, and also that the people of Memphis preferred the squirrels.&quot; He is informed of the ordinance prohibiting dogs not on chain in any of the parks, and that the Commission would uphold Mr. Davis in the discharge of his duties. Mr. Galloway states there are too many squirrels in Court Square &quot;and recommended that about fifty be transferred to Overton Park.&quot; This will be done. Also, Court Square is &quot;being used by a number of itinerant preachers for daily service.&quot; The keeper at Court Square is instructed &quot;not to permit such services in the future unless special permission&quot; is granted by the Commissioners.
Pages 350-351, Nov. 28, 1910: In a letter to the Commission, Mayor E.H. Crump praises its work: “The system has been splendidly developed, is a great source of pride to the citizens, and places Memphis at the top in this regard.” However, future plans of the Commission depend on funds that the majority of the City Board of Commissioners believe are required for “the construction of streets and [viaducts]. . . . At this time it is the general belief that Memphis has enough parks for its present and near future needs.” He wants to “pause a while until the rest of municipal utilities are pushed as far forward.” The Commissioners reply by letter that “We were not aware that it is the general belief” that Memphis has enough parks. “Park work never ‘pauses,’ it grows as the city grows.” They recall how the Commission had succeeded despite being hard-pressed financially. “No taxes were levied for park purposes by our city for the years 1900, 1901, and 1902, and only ten cents for 1903, 1904, and 1905. . . . We asked the Legislature to increase the tax to twenty cents for the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, but this has since been reduced to fifteen cents.” Nevertheless, “As to future work we shall not make a move, unless we feel assured that the citizens want it.”

Memphis Park Commission Minute Book 2
(February 14, 1911 – January 12, 1916):
Introduction and Excerpts
At the beginning of its second decade the members of the Park Commission are Chairman Robert Galloway, Dr. Benjamin F. Turner and John T. Willingham; Abe Goodman will later replace Turner. In Book 2, year-end audits of the Commission become more frequent and will be found here for 1910-1914. Lists of bills owed by the Commission continue to appear throughout, every month or so. A budget (so-called “estimated requirements”) for 1913 is found on sheets bound between pp. 132-133, and budgets for 1914 (pp. 231-233) and 1915 (p. 303) appear at the end of the 1913 and 1914 audits respectively.
The lists of itemized monthly bills are handled as described for Book 1, i.e. (February 14, 1911) “The monthly bills as shown by this appended hereto, were duly considered and ordered vouchered.” The Commission’s purchasing and contracting methods remain varied. Chairman Galloway simply “reports” on April 9, 1912 that he had sold a cottage and “awarded a contract to Lew Tisdale &amp; Co. for installing plumbing fixtures” in an Overton Park lavatory; his actions are approved. The Zoo Superintendent is simply authorized to buy an incubator for hatching eggs produced by birds at the zoo (April 21, 1914). The Commission’s Secretary is directed to advertise for sealed bids for the printing of the Park Report (December 9, 1914).
The minutes themselves are all typed onto the pages of this minute book, a method used until the advent of laser printers in the 1990s. Audits and lists of bills, expenditures, letters from City Hall, notices to bidders, and the like continue to be pasted into the book.
In addition to Park Commission property listed in the discussion of Minute Book 1, an audit in January 1912 (p. 81) adds Annesdale (Park), Astor Park, Belvedere Square, Chickasaw Park, and Jackson Mound (Park). Three years later (p. 286) another audit adds Belvedere Triangle (the re-named Belvedere Square), DeSoto Park (the re-named Jackson Mound), and Douglass Park. Noteworthy is a 1915 report by the Commission’s attorney and former mayor James H. Malone, who gives “a brief statement of dates when the various parks were acquired, and the various sources of title thereto.” His list is worth summarizing here: The Promenade, and Auction, Court, Exchange and Market Squares (1819); Astor Park (1838); Forrest Park (conveyed by unrecorded deed before the Civil War); Bickford Park (1869); Gaston Park (1900); Overton and Riverside Parks (1901); Annesdale Park (conveyance unclear, perhaps ca. 1905); Chickasaw and Confederate Parks (reclaimed from The Promenade, 1906-1910); Belvedere Triangle (1909); DeSoto and Douglass Parks (1913); Tri-State Fair Grounds (later sometimes called Recreation Park, also 1913); and Parkway (no dates given but may have ranged from 1906 to 1916).
The Commission continues to have problems with poles and wires on the parkways, and with speeders on North Parkway who “made as much as eighty miles an hour,” greatly outrunning the park motorcycle policeman. Most of the city remains inside the parkways, 33
but houses are being built along their outer edge and homeowners need access to municipal services. The Commission is now routinely considering requests for sewer and water lines and gas mains to be laid across the parkways to these homes – and contending with a City Water Department that is crossing North Parkway “at will with service pipes over the refusal of the Park Commissioners.” Meetings feature petitions to the Commission to beautify this or that median strip, or grade and plant school grounds, the Shelby County Court House, the new Police Station, the City Hospital, etc. The Commission is asked to “oil streets,” i.e. spray unpaved streets with oil to keep down the dust and to facilitate water run-off. And there is no abatement of the caving in of the bluff along Riverside Park.
Progress is slow in acquiring land for the southern leg of the parkway system. In 1911 the New South Memphis Land Company offers to donate land for this purpose, but the deal is not finalized until early 1916. Jackson Mound Park is acquired after consultation with Mayor Crump who feels the amount to be paid is excessive. And notwithstanding the Mayor’s efforts to curtail what he sees as excessive drain on city finances, the Commission offers a quarter of a million dollars to the New Memphis Jockey Club and thus obtains 210 acres for a “Recreation Park and Play Grounds” alongside East Parkway. George E. Kessler’s “plan #1” for its development calls for a half-mile-long racetrack and a large public swimming pool. The Mayor and City Commission are requested to pay for building the pool.
Mrs. Bessie Brooks informs the Commission of her wish to “erect a Memorial Art Gallery to the memory of her husband” in Overton Park. She will pay to erect, finish, care for and maintain it, and the Commission gratefully accepts her offer.
At the request of “prominent negro educators in the city,” the first arrangements are made for African-American school children to visit the zoo every Tuesday morning in June 1911. The question of a “negro park” continues to be raised; the following year Mayor Crump and City Commissioners write to the Park Commissioners that “it is but fair that some provision be made . . . and there is nothing in the [annual] report of the Park Commission to indicate that such a step is even contemplated.” In 1913 a committee appointed by the Mayor selects “a tract of land known as Douglass Park” for this purpose and the Park Commission takes it over.
Audits indicate that the Commission benefits from the sale of hay and wood and from concessions, at least at Overton Park. The nursery set up in 1911 near Riverside Park annoys “a number of the Nurserymen and landscape gardeners of the City” to the extent that they lodge a protest against the sale of its shrubbery to the public. For six years the Commission works to clarify its title to Astor Park vis-à-vis its occupant Pittsburg Coal Co., and the matter is finally decided by the Supreme Court in the Commission’s favor. Perhaps encouraged by this victory in the Astor Park litigation, the Park Commission also takes action in 1915 “to recover land on the levee occupied by the Dan Shea Boiler works.”
Excerpts from Minute Book 2:
Page 8, Feb. 14, 1911: In the annual audit, a list of “Receipts Dec. 1, 1909 – Jan. 1, 1911” includes the items “Refreshment Privilege Overton Pk., $1758.33,” “Sale of Hay, Shrubs and logs, $626.05” and “Board of Education, 3 Cars Gravel, $57.85.” 34
Page 27, April 19, 1911: W.W. Robinson applied “for the privilege of selling soda water, and other similar drinks in the Parks”; the Secretary is instructed to “decline his proposition.”
Page 33, May 6, 1911: The river has “encroached about five hundred feet into the [Riverside] park property in the last six years.” Captain Claude S. Smith of the U.S. Army Corps of engineers suggests construction of revetments and mattresses. The Park Commission requests the Mayor and Commissioners of the City of Memphis to “take up the matter with our representatives in Congress, with a view to securing an appropriation from the Federal Government.”
Page 37, May 31, 1911: A “number of the prominent negro educators in the city” have applied for the privilege “of allowing the negro school children, under proper supervision” to visit the zoo. The Commission decides “that the negro school children be allowed in Overton Park and the Zoo from 8.00 A.M. to 1.00 P.M. each Tuesday during the month of June next, when accompanied by their teachers; the schools to divide their scholars as they deem proper; provided that they go to and return from the park in special cars provided for this purpose.”
Page 47, July 18, 1911: Letter from Mayor E.H. Crump dated June 16: “Gentlemen:--At a recent meeting of the Commissioners of the city of Memphis a resolution was adopted looking toward the acquisition of a park for colored citizens, a copy of which, has been placed in your hands. I will thank you to take this question up again, and see if it is not possible to obtain a site which will meet with the approval of all people.” The accompanying copy of the resolution requests the Park Commission “to see if there is not some spot which can be chosen where its occupancy by the colored people will not lead to friction between the races.”
Pages 99-100, May 15, 1912: Attention is called to “the condition of the drainage in front of the Zoo”; whenever there has been a heavy rain “the water overflowed the street car tracks and caused much damage in the Zoo grounds.”
Page 111, July 29, 1912: A resolution passed by the City of Memphis on July 23 refers to “high water such as recently caused great damage” in the city and requests the Park Commission “to join with the city in an effort to have the next session of the legislature” authorize a $500,000 issue of park bonds “to be applied in part payment of the expense of building and completing the needed improvements to prevent another overflow in the northern part of the city.”
Page 127, Jan. 15, 1913: “Chairman [Galloway] stated that during the year of 1912, he had instructed Superintendent Davis to superintend the planting of the yards of several residents of Memphis without any charge for his services.”
Page 149, March 11, 1913: A “resolution by the Commissioners of the City of Memphis was received and ordered spread upon the minutes” to the effect that the Commissioners had authorized and ratified “the purchase by the Park Commissioners of a tract of ground for Park purposes” (i.e. Jackson Mound Park); the tract was 9.79 acres and the cost was 35
$85,000. The copy bound into the minutes is certified as a full, true and correct copy by Ennis M. Douglass, City Clerk.
Page 157, April 21, 1913: Potentate A.E. Camero of Al Chymia Temple requests that they be allowed to carry the shrine camel “Al Chymia” with them to Dallas to the Shrine Convention. Permission is given “with the understanding that Al Chymia Temple will bear all expense, and return the camel in good shape.”
Pages 158-161, May 13, 1913: A committee appointed by the Mayor has selected “a tract of land known as Douglass Park to be used as a park for the colored people,” and its purchase has been authorized by the Board of Commissioners. The committee states that “Although all parks in the city are in theory open to the entire body of citizens, custom prevents the colored people from frequenting the park used by the white citizens.” Commissioners Turner and Willingham offer a resolution to purchase the property, and although some individuals including Commissioner Galloway speak against the resolution, it passes.
Pages 167-169, June 10, 1913: “Chairman Galloway stated that he had been arrested but allowed to give a forfeit for $5.00 on account of not having the side walk on Second Street on Court Square repaired. After discussion the Board declined to repair same, taking a position that the City claimed possession of the side walks and that the city should make the necessary repairs.” Messrs. Patrick &amp; Bingley will look after the Golf Links and caddies at Overton Park and will be allowed to charge for lessons. They will have caddies register and wear badges, and caddies will be allowed to charge for their services. “They have agreed to see that order is kept on Links.” A fine selection of “Play ground apparatus” has been purchased for Overton Park for $350.55.
Page 172, June 19, 1913: About 65 acres of land valued at about $4,000 per acre “had already gone into the River” and the caving bank is now only about 40 feet from the large pavilion in Riverside Park. The Mayor was asked for funds to move the pavilion, since the Park Commission has no funds until the receipt of this year’s taxes. The Mayor said he would advance enough money to move the pavilion, but that was all he could do.
Pages 187-188, Sept. 9, 1913: The Jackson Mound Park transaction is now complete. The Commission decides “the name should be changed from Jackson Mound, which signified nothing, to DESOTO, the discoverer of the Mississippi River.”
Page 190, Sept. 27, 1913: Mr. Duke C. Bowers offers “to construct a wading pool for the children of Memphis, at his expense, in Overton Park.”
Page 201, Dec. 9, 1913: Mrs. Henry Oppenheimer complains that “an automobile belonging to the Park Commission had splashed mud and grease on her silk dress, which was damaged to the extent of $35.” She is offered $15.
Page 211, Feb. 19, 1914: George E. Kessler submits a blueprint for DeSoto Park.
Pages 250-251, June 16, 1914: A person “representing the Evergreen Club made a vigorous protest against the practice of allowing negroes the use of Overton Park on Tuesdays. He 36
spoke at length pointing out the dangerous consequences which might ensue and asked the Park Commission to put an end to it.” Others speak to the same effect, pointing out that “the negroes were gradually demanding more and more privileges in the public parks.” The Commission receives their petition for future consideration. The Commission has applied to the U.S. Government to acquire “what is known as the Marine Hospital for park purposes.”
Page 255, June 22, 1914: A resolution is approved stating that because “all necessary work” had been completed at Douglass Park (cleaning up grounds, repairing buildings, digging a deep well), it is decided “that no more permits be issued to colored people for picnics at Overton Park.” Colored children may visit the zoo as formerly, “on Tuesdays, until 1 o’clock P.M.” The Commission will provide within 12 months, “sooner if its finances will permit,” playground apparatus and a wading pool at Douglass Park “for the exclusive use of colored children.”
Pages 258, Aug. 11, 1914: A page is set aside in the minutes dedicated to “Appreciating and Thanking the James Alexander Construction Co., for their generous gift of playground apparatus for Douglas [sic for Douglass] Park.”
Pages 259-260, Sept. 8, 1914: Ladies have suffered “improper treatment . . . on the Overton Park course by caddies.” The Superintendent is authorized to put a policeman in charge of the course, and is also to post the rules governing play. “Mr. Lawrence Hagenback [sic for Hagenbeck] of Hamburg, Germany, from whom the pair of hippottami [sic] were purchased in May 1913 for $4,000.00 on one years time” stated in a letter that on account of the European war he was very hard-pressed for money and would appreciate it greatly if the Park Commission would make a payment. He will be sent $2,700, the amount that has been subscribed so far for that purpose. (The hippopotami were Venus and Adonis, a most prolific, long-lived and remunerative pair of animals.)
Page 275, Dec. 9, 1914: Commissioner Willingham as a committee of one is to confer with City Commissioner Dies “relative to the City installing an arc lamp” at the intersection of East Parkway and Poplar Boulevard in the interest of safety. The Park Commission is receiving “many requests for donations of shrubbery to institutions of a public nature. After some discussion it was agreed that the resolution previously adopted to the effect that the Park Commission would furnish shrubbery without cost to Eleemosynary Institutions should stand.”
Page 280, February 15, 1915: Zoo Superintendent Castang has had an offer from a dealer in New York “to deliver Monkeys suitable for the monkey mountain,” and is authorized “to purchase 20 male and 5 female monkeys at a cost of not exceeding $1,000.00.”
Pages 304-314, March 15, 1915: Minutes begin with a long “statement of the Memphis Abstract Co. giving [deed] book and page of all property under the control of the Park Commission.” This is followed by a report from Attorney (and former Mayor) James H. Malone noting that “recently the Board won the hard fought case of Memphis vs. Pittsburg Coal Co., not only in the Chancery Court and Court of Civil Appeals, but finally in the Supreme Court. This case involved the title to Astor Park.” Filed with the Board of 37
Commissioners (but unfortunately absent from the minutes) is a history of Astor Park and “another paper, giving a sketch of the dedication of Court Square, Market Square, Auction Square, Exchange Square, and also the splendid river frontage called the Public Promenade.” Malone states that he “found a voluminous record in an ancient case in the belfry of the Court House at Jackson, where a large quantity of papers were spread out on the floor, all seemingly waste paper; but in reality they were old records of the Supreme Court.” They included “a lengthy deposition given by Major Marcus B. Winchester . . . in 1851, in the evening of his life.” Malone concludes with “a brief statement of dates when the various parks were acquired, and the various sources of title thereto.” Chairman Galloway has purchased three “valuable crocodiles” in Florida and will also pay to have them shipped to Memphis “and all other expenses pertaining to same.” Mr. Duke C. Bowers proposes to construct a wading pool in Forrest Park, a gift accepted by the Commission.
Page 320, April 8, 1915: The Park Commission is asked by Superintendent Ford of the Recreation Commission for assistance “in prohibiting cigarette smoking among children using playgrounds.” The Commission responds that it has no authority to do this.
Page 331, Oct. 5, 1915: Court Square Fountain “was badly in need of repairs and prompt action was necessary, to protect it from rust and erosion.”
Pages 340 and 342, Jan. 12, 1916: A resolution by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Memphis is spread upon the minutes, stating that as “the Park Commissioners are desirous of constructing a Parkway from the east line of Riverside Park through the lands of the South Memphis Land Company and others to the Hernando Road,” and since the necessary rights-of-way have been donated, the Commission may proceed with the building of the said (South) parkway. “After discussion the hour of meeting was changed from 1:30 P.M. to 3:30 P.M. on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of each month.”

Memphis Park Commission Minute Book 3
(February 8, 1916 – March 4, 1924):
Introduction and Excerpts
In February 1916 the Park Commission members are Chairman Robert Galloway, John T. Willingham and Abe Goodman. During the course of years covered by Book 3, Galloway is replaced by Albert L. Parker, and Goodman by Frank N. Fisher.
Audits, bills, important correspondence, the Superintendent’s annual reports, a few bids, etc. are still pasted into the minutes. The semi-monthly detailed lists of bills end with one for December 1919, none to follow for a number of years. The form of payment changes to something along these lines: “Bills for the month were approved and ordered vouchered [or paid],” or “Secretary directed to voucher such current bills as were approved by the Superintendent.” Usually there is no indication of how much money is involved; that would not change until 1925 (see Minute Book 4). There remains little or no routine mention of payroll amounts, but some details about how the payroll is handled are seen in a resolution passed April 26, 1921: “Upon motion of Mr. Fisher, the following resolution was unanimously passed, the same having received the second of Mr. Parker. “Resolved that a fund be created in the depository of the Park Commission by the deposit of regular pay roll checks, signed as usual by the Park Commissioners, said fund to be checked out in favor of individual names on the pay roll. Said pay roll checks to be signed by the Secretary or in his absence by the Assistant Secretary, and in the absence of both the Secretary and the assistant Secretary, by one of the Park Commissioners.””
It appears that some items acquired by the Commission are still not necessarily submitted to the competitive bidding process. The Superintendent is sometimes “authorized to purchase” what he needs, i.e. “four good mare mules at not exceeding $250 each” as well as “three power lawn mowers” (April 6, 1916). But also that year (November 25, 1916), “In response to advertisement . . . bids to furnish fish [to the Zoo] for 12 months were opened.” Two bids are identical and the contract is split between the bidders. In June 1919, Commissioner Goodman moves that Commissioner Parker’s “purchase of Mack truck from the Southern Coal Co. for $2,650.00 be ratified” and it is approved. But at the same meeting the “Superintendent was directed to advertise for 350 tons of lump coal f.o.b. Memphis.”
Yearly audits continue for only the early portion of this book, in 1915-1918. The audit of 1915 is preceded by the 1916 budget (p. 5) and the audit of 1916 by the 1917 budget (p. 46). No budgets are seen for 1918-1919, but they resume for 1920-1923. A new feature is annual reports by the General Superintendent of the park system; they appear early in the year for the period 1918-1924.
New parks or other facilities added by the Commission since ones mentioned earlier are listed in the budget of May 1923 (p. 339): Beauregard, Bellevue and Hodges Fields; Brooks Memorial Art Gallery; Robert Church and Robert Galloway Parks; Litty, Malone, (Dean) Morris, Peabody (name changed from Wills Park), and Recreation (later usually called Fair 41
Grounds) Parks; and Red Bud Triangle. References to the acquisition or opening of some of these will be seen in the Excerpts below. At Mayor Rowlett Paine’s suggestion, the Commission assumes the work of the city’s Amusement and Recreation Commission in 1921, and by the spring of 1922 it has organized a course of study for those interested in staff positions.
Maintaining and improving Overton Park and the zoo continue to be significant Commission preoccupations, but managing the conversion of the Tri-State Fairgrounds into park and playground requires an increasing amount of attention and funds. A 20-year lease is signed with the Tri-State Fair Association in 1918 for the latter to occupy the Fairgrounds, “now owned by the City of Memphis as a public amusement and recreation park.” Plans call for the mile-long racetrack to be replaced with a half-mile track, and for moving the grandstand alongside it. This takes nearly three years to get underway, but afterward the work proceeds quickly. It is noted that when trees are planted to outline the new roads, “On account of the poor condition of the soil it was necessary to use dynamite in planting these trees and a large amount of new soil had to be hauled for each tree.” A bond issue of $250,000 helps raise funds for “a commodious swimming pool,” an entrance to the grounds, and, to showcase their handiwork, a Women’s and Children’s Building. In 1922 scarcely a meeting passes without reference to some feature of the Fairgrounds as being planned or under construction.
Zoo Superintendent Phil Castang submits his resignation to the Commission in March 1917, and it is accepted by a vote of two to one, Chairman Galloway protesting. Two weeks later Galloway resigns as Chairman, saying that it must be evident “that I am out of line with the present Park Commission” and that other members “have very little confidence in my judgment.” Reading between the lines, it appears that Castang had asked for a salary increase that the other Commissioners disapproved of. Two weeks after Galloway resigns as Chairman, Castang requests his job back and is given it over the protest of Commissioner Goodman.
The consequences of World War I are noticed only occasionally in the minutes. Superintendent of Parks Charles W. Davis reports early in 1919 that the scarcity of labor is so acute, “we endeavored to use women for work on the Parkway and in the parks . . . but this was very unsatisfactory and expensive and we were compelled to abandon this innovation.” Due to war conditions “it was extremely hard to secure material, even at the very high prices, when we needed them”; and war activities in Court Square had “militated against the looks of this park.”
The Commission finds itself balked in an attempt to banish unsightly fruit stands from the sidewalks around Court Square. On the one hand, these stands have become a public nuisance, but on the other, “owing to the peculiar function of Court Square as being the home of the squirrels which have a nation wide reputation” it is necessary to provide some source where the public could buy peanuts and other food for them. The Commission decides to construct a building in the square that can be leased for this purpose. However, despite pleas to the Mayor, the City Commissioners and the Police Department, three years later the sidewalk stands are still there.

Excerpts from Minute Book 3:
Page 27, May 22, 1916: There is an “imperative need” of a Comfort Station in Forrest Park. Mrs. Brooks is ready to make a formal transfer of the Brooks Memorial Building to the Park Commission; it will be dedicated on May 25, and Miss Florence McIntyre has been chosen as its Custodian.
Pages 30-31, June 19, 1916: Commissioners find the new Hippo House in the Zoo unsatisfactory. Permits have been issued to the Cumberland Telephone and Telegraph Co. to lay conduits under the Parkway “with the understanding that the resurfacing of the Park Way would be done by the Park Commission at their expense.”
Page 48, March 22, 1917: The Commission denies the Water Department’s application to cross North Parkway at No. 1829 with a 5/8-inch service pipe, but will allow it to cross “with not less than a two inch lead pipe for the purpose of supplying this and other houses.”
Page 49, March 30, 1917: The Memphis Artesian Water Dept. objects “to supplying said residence with water in the manner suggested by said Memphis Park Commission” and “Present connections shall remain at option of Water Company.”
Page 58, May 2, 1917: The limits of the Zoological Garden are defined as: “On the South, the Street Car tracks. On the west, McLean Ave. On the North, that part of the North Parkway formerly known as the Speedway. On the east, the road just east of the bear dens, running northwest to the Speedway.”
Page 61, July 23, 1917: Superintendent Phil Castang reports a “list of donations and deaths at the Zoo for month of June 1917.” The new animals include an Elk “Born in Zoo,” a Coati Mundi from “Mrs. Cangland, Galveston, Texas,” a Horned Owl from “Mr. W.A. Smith, City,” etc. Deaths include two “Pekin Nightingales, Natural Cause,” one “Coyoti, Killed, Bad Back,” and a “Sea Lion, Lungs Gone.”
Page 64, Nov. 9, 1917: Miss McIntyre, Director of the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, reports that in October there were 2,974 visitors. The Modern Dutch Art exhibition will end Nov. 15.
Page 68, Feb. 5, 1918: City Commissioners elect Mr. A.L. Parker “to fill the unexpired term of Col. Robert Galloway deceased.”
Page 98, June 11, 1918: A number of residents adjacent to Overton Park have requested that “the use of loud brass instruments and drums during dances at the Rest House be prohibited and the music restricted to string bands etc.” The request is granted.
Page 100, July 16, 1918: “Mr. Goodman moved that the commission appropriate $140.00 for four concerts at $35.00 each to be given at the colored Plymouth Community House. 43
Seconded by Mr. Parker and passed, the Secretary being instructed to prepare the usual contract for the music with [W.C.] Handy’s Band.”
Pages 109-114, Dec. 30, 1918: Ringling Bros. donates an elephant to the zoo. James Avdalis wins the 3-year lease to the Overton Park Refectory with a bid of $9,500; an inventory included in the lease indicates he sells ice cream, sodas, cigars, popcorn and coffee.
Pages 115-117, Feb. 4, 1919: A list of rules governing play on the Overton Park golf links is adopted, including one stating that “Women wearing high heeled shoes shall not be allowed on the courses.” Minutes record the names and monthly salaries of the following “heads of departments and the employees under them”: L.M. DeSaussure, Secretary, $200; C.W. Davis, Superintendent, $200; J.C. Shivler, Asst., $125; J.W. Cullen, Zoo Superintendent, $175; M.L. Click, Riverside Superintendent, $100; B.A. Adams, Engineer, $125; L.H. Smith, Time-keeper, $120; J.B. Beckett, Parkway Policeman, $100; C.W. Ferguson, Overton Policeman, $75; J.T. Alexander, Riverside Policeman, $75; Miss F. McIntyre, Brooks Memorial, $100; Miss A. Kamp, Clerk, $66.66; and C.W. Gwynn, Bickford (Park), $10.
Pages 127-128, March 22, 1919: Rules and regulations for Brooks Memorial Art Gallery are adopted; for example, there will be no loud talking, smoking or spitting in the building.
Page 153, Sept. 8, 1919: Commission Secretary L.M. DeSaussure is directed to write a letter to the Mayor and each of the City Commissioners stating that the Commission has built a fruit stand in Court Square “to get rid of the unsightly fruit stands on the corners.” It had been agreed that the Police Department would have the sidewalk fruit stands removed by Sept. 1, but they are still there. The Commission requests that they be ordered off “under the police power of the city at once as public nuisances.”
Pages 169-177, Jan. 22, 1920: The annual report on the park system by Supt. Charles W. Davis states that the Zoological Garden, especially, “required a great deal of attention in the way of new work and repairs.” The monkey house “has long been found to be unsanitary and unsuitable” so it was reconstructed. “The unprecedented rain fall of over seven inches in one day caused great damage to two of the concrete bridges” in Riverside Park. Those repairs were expensive. The largest part of Court Square had been resodded and the comfort station required a large amount of attention, the plumbing having “about served its usefulness . . . During the baseball season the baseball bulletin in front of one of the newspaper offices attracts tremendous crowds who trample out our grass and shrub beds, obliterate the hedge and even break off limbs of the trees.” Confederate Park was used “for a circus and Hippodrome. Almost the entire park was placed under canvas for seven days and nights,” practically obliterating the flowerbeds, the sod and the shrubbery.
Page 199, Aug. 2, 1920: Mayor Rowlett Paine writes the Commission that he has decided “the activities heretofore conducted by the Amusement and Recreation Commission can best be handled under the direct supervision of the Park Commission, and I am asking that the Park Commission take over this work as of August 1st.” He will have the proper ordinances drawn up to authorize this. The Park Commission agrees and elects Mr. Walter G. Smith as Supt. of Recreation with Miss Minnie G. Wagner as Asst. Supt. (See Minute Book 2 between pp. 66 and 67, located in Folder 2 of Box 2, for 32 pages of Minutes of Meetings of 44
the Commissioners for Public Recreation Parks and Playgrounds [P&amp;Pg], the so-called “Recreation Commission,” during the years of its existence. Perhaps this is the Commission referred to by Mayor Paine.)
Page 203, Oct. 26, 1920: The bust of General Andrew Jackson in Court Square is “being disintegrated by the action of the weather and inasmuch as this statue had been pronounced by experts as being one of the finest in America” the Secretary is directed to see if it may be placed inside the County Court House.
Page 207, Dec. 7, 1920: Miss Bertha Simmons submits a claim for the loss of her coat in the elephant building, saying it “was taken from her arm by the elephant and destroyed.”
Page 216, Feb. 1, 1921: General Superintendent C.W. Davis’s annual report for 1920 states: “During the year we set aside an area in the [Overton Park] picnic grounds, at the suggestion of Mr. Willingham for the use of automobile parties touring through Memphis. This venture proved to be a wise one and we accommodated a large number of tourists from all sections of the country who were very appreciative and loud in their praise of Memphis on this account.”
Page 229, April 18, 1921: The Legislature authorized “that the City of Memphis shall issue bonds in an amount not to exceed” $250,000, and sell the same, the proceeds to be used by the Commission “in equipping and improving the Memphis Recreation Park and playgrounds for fair and recreation park purposes.” Specific projects are “a commodious swimming pool” for $75,000, an entrance and approaches to the grounds for $50,000, a Women’s and Children’s Building to showcase their handiwork at $100,000, and replanting the grounds for $25,000.
Page 235, May 3, 1921: “A committee consisting of the Secretary, Superintendent and Superintendent of Recreation was directed to investigate and make report as to the availability of athletic fields for negroes as soon as possible.”
Pages 241-242, July 12, 1921: The Commission requests the Mayor and Board of Commissioners of the City of Memphis to purchase the R.R. Church property on Beale Avenue. “In our judgment this property is needed to be improved and used as a recreation park and for general park purposes, and for general public uses.” They have been offered this property for $85,000.
Page 249, Sept. 8, 1921: The name of Wills Park is changed to Peabody Park “at the formal request of the Peabody Civic League.”
Page 251, Oct. 6, 1921: Former Mayor H.H. Litty believes there should be a suitable memorial “to Colonel Robert Galloway in view of his distinguished services in the . . . Park System,” and suggests “that it would be most fitting for the use of Overton Park to be changed to Galloway Park. “ Commissioners heartily agree that there should be some memorial “commensurate with his services.”
Page 255, Nov. 15, 1921: “Mr. Parker moved that Superintendent Davis be authorized to 45
proceed with the development of Church’s Park in accordance with the recommendation and estimates furnished jointly by himself and the Superintendent of Recreation.”
Page 270, Jan. 20, 1922: The Secretary is “authorized to issue permit to the Memphis Gas &amp; Electric Co. to cross the South Parkway with a six inch gas main in two places to take care of property at the intersection of the South Parkway and Cooper Street.”
Pages 273-277, March 4, 1922: “General plans for the development of the Recreation Department” are adopted and spread upon the minutes. A public playground course is to be given “to prepare the future members of the Playground Staff for the intensive summer vacation, playground season.” Applicants for a position of Assistant Instructor “must be female citizens of the United States, at least 18 years of age, and must be graduates of a senior high school, or its equivalent.” These applicants, if they pass the course with a grade of at least 88%, are eligible to be appointed Instructor.
Pages 289-290 and 292, May 2, 1922: “Specifications for bathing suits in the municipal pool were adopted and the Superintendent of Recreation directed to strictly enforce the same.” Material is to be of somber colors for both men and women, “No bright colors allowed.” Several probably new playgrounds or other recreation areas are mentioned: Bellevue Athletic Field, Dean Morris Playground, Hill School, and Beauregard Field. The Secretary is directed “to issue permits for the use of the auditorium [in Church Park] for banquets to responsible organizations, provided same was not used for money making purposes.”
Page 296, June 6, 1922: After hearing protests from various sources, and getting advice from “ladies from the Nineteenth Century Club . . . as to what would be proper and advisable,” it is decided that the “Rule in regard to colors [of bathing suits] be abrogated.”
Pages 300-302, July 21, 1922: Litty Playground is turned over to the City of Memphis through the Commission “to be used for Park purposes. . . . Said use to be for members of the Caucasian race only.”
Page 303, July 27, 1922: The Engineers’ Club has asked the Commission to maintain certain neutral strips, but “the Park Attorney advised that we had no legal right” to do so. The Secretary is directed “to write to the Secretary of the Tri-State Fair Association, requesting him to ascertain if Colored Fairs were held in various southern cities and to get his recommendation upon the subject as applying to Memphis conditions.” Refreshment contracts for both Overton Park and the Tri-State Fairgrounds are ratified and spread upon the minutes.
Page 310, July 29, 1922: “The Commissioners feel that the Recreation and Playground Department growing as rapidly as it is, requires the entire time of a General Superintendent.” Mr. L.M. DeSaussure (the Commission’s former Secretary) “with his wide acquaintance and his intimate knowledge of the Memphis Park Commission work is splendidly qualified to fill this exacting position.”
Page 331, April 11, 1923: H.W. Brennan donates about 120 acres for “a new park near the corner of Highland and Poplar Avenue”; the Commissioners vote unanimously to name it 46
Robert Galloway Park, “and the drive around said park, the Galloway Drive.”
Page 352, May 15, 1923: The 1922 Annual Report dated Jan. 31, 1923, states: “Church’s Park (Colored): It will appear that this past year considerable improvement has been made at Church’s Park. The concrete culvert has been finished. The keeper’s house remodelled, painted and wired. The auditorium building done over, the stage has been cut down and a new roof placed over the same. The building has been painted inside and outside with two coats of paint, and a partition placed on the East side for the recreation department. A room back of the stage has been arranged for the recreation department. A meeting room has also been provided for the colored American Legion.”
Page 366, Aug. 16, 1923: Locations are approved for permanent concession on the Fairgrounds: “Roller Coaster, shooting Gallery, Old Mill, Circle Swing, Carrousel,” also the Kentucky Derby, the Swinging Beauty, and the Balloon racer. There will also be a dance pavilion.
Page 368, Sept. 12, 1923: Regarding the “application by Captain W.F. Widgery, Captain of the Salvation Army, for permission to use DeSoto Park, and the application of the Reverend J. Ralph Roberts of the Third Christian Church, to use Bickford park for meetings,” it has always been the policy of the Commission since its beginning not to grant permits “to any organization for exclusive use of any of the parks, or parts thereof, for meetings.”
(Bound in following p. 402 at the end of the book are the 1923 annual reports on onionskin: 5 pages, undated, of the “Report of Recreation Department for 1923” signed by Robert O’Brien, “Secretary &amp; Superintendent of Recreation”; 13 pages of a report covering the entire park system dated Jan. 1, 1924 and signed by C.W. Davis, “General Superintendent”; and 6 pages reporting on the operations of the zoo dated Jan. 7, 1924 and signed by C.W. Cullen, “Superintendent of Zoo.)
On p. 1 of Davis’s 1923 report, under the heading “New Tourists Camp,” he states: “The old tourists camp was inadequate and no accommodations – absolutely an eye sore from the main drive East of the [Overton] Park. At the suggestion of Mr. Willingham we laid out a camp in lots of 25 x 25 with road surrounding same. Also enlarged comfort station, installing shower baths for both men and women, electric lights – In fact we now have one of the most modern camps in the South – small but adequate. During the year 1923 we had 845 Tourists cars to visit our camp and never less than two people and as many as five per car.”

Memphis Park Commission Minute Book 4
(May 6, 1924 – September 16, 1930):
Introduction and Excerpts
Park Commissioners in May 1924 are Chairman John T. Willingham, Albert L. Parker and Frank N. Fisher; during the period covered here, none is replaced while each takes a turn as Chairman. No annual audits appear in this book, and no annual reports by the Superintendents of the park system or the Zoo. An item worth noting, though, is a report giving an extensive description of the Memphis Zoo and suggestions for improving it, by Herman W. Merkel, Chief Forester of the New York Zoological Garden (dated January 1925 and bound between pp. 28 and 29). Budgets continue for the years 1924-1930.
Early in this book some variation of the usual comment concerning bill payment is given (“all bills properly approved were ordered vouchered for payment”). Also as usual (since early in Book 3) there is no record of the actual amount, but this changes on November 8, 1925, when dollar amounts appear again, a practice that will continue for the lifetime of the Park Commission. There is no mention yet of overall payroll figures. Details of the bidding and purchasing process continue to be unclear. “Mr. McGee, Architect of Pink Palace” submits bids on marble work and on the heating plant (January 4, 1927). Later that year (August 3) five bids are received for roofing the Auto Building on the Fairgrounds; Chairman Fisher is “out of the city” and asks Commissioners Willingham and Parker to “handle to conclusion.” On April 4, 1929 another Pink Palace architect, George Mahan, is given permission to buy what he requires in the way of hardware, painting and decorating.
The Commission budget of February 1930 (bound between pp. 320 and 321) lists parks or other acquisitions since 1923 as follows: Colonial, Orange Mound, Washington Amusement, and Williamson Parks; Guthrie and South Side Playgrounds; and the Museum (i.e. Pink Palace).
The Commission’s attention continues to be divided between the mundane and the unusual. One of the latter items would have been the contention between the Commission and the Collier family (and its Collier &amp; Collier law firm), who complain about (among other things) the enormous new Fairgrounds swimming pool. When the pool was drained once a week, the “dirty bathwater” as the Colliers referred to it in the newspapers, washed to the north across Central Avenue and flooded the adjacent family farm.
Finances could be a problem; more than once the Commission is forced to borrow operating funds, usually $300,000, until its share of yearly taxes become available the following September. A bond issue of $350,000 that the Commission requested from the City of Memphis in 1927 is intended not only for extending the park system but also for paying current expenses.
The Commission turns its attention to providing greater comfort to park users during this period. The public asks for and the Commission provides more “comfort stations” in 51
pavilions, bandstands and elsewhere, and as it becomes financially possible, it installs heating plants for winter use in some of the larger buildings. It contracts for group life and disability insurance for all park employees and increases fire insurance coverage for its buildings. With increasing park capacity and playground activity come more complaints of injuries sustained on Commission property and equipment. The residents of Kenilworth Avenue and the Parkview bordering Overton Park are perennial complainants to the Commission about problems with traffic congestion due to park visitors.
During the period covered by this book the Soldiers’ Memorial Monument appears in Overton Park, and numerous tennis courts are constructed in both old and new parks. But the heaviest emphasis is given, during the years 1927-1930, to the conversion of the Pink Palace into the Museum of Natural History and Industrial Arts, and to its operation.
In a creative move on June 7, 1927 the Commissioners consign different parts of the park system to the attention of different commissioners. This has become necessary because &quot;the Memphis Park System has grown to such magnitude, with respect to the details incident to the operation thereof, as to necessitate a division of work between the three commissioners . . . in order that the operation thereof may be efficiently and promptly attended to.&quot; Commissioner Willingham will supervise Overton Park except for the Zoo and Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, as well as Riverside Park and all other Park properties south of Beale Street. Commissioner Parker will supervise the Zoo, Galloway Park, the Recreation Office at the Fair Grounds, the Recreation Department and its operations in all of the parks, and all other Park properties north of Beale Street including Douglass Park. Commissioner Fisher will supervise Brooks Memorial Art Gallery, the Tri State Fair Grounds except for the Recreation Office, the buildings and grounds donated by and purchased from Chickasaw Gardens, Inc. (i.e. the Pink Palace), the office at the Court House, and the Parkway roads outside of the several parks.

He then stated he wished to build a culvert on his property along the meanderings of the swimming pool drain, and asked permission of the Board to haul material for culvert across the sidewalk, stating he had no other access to grounds.

<dc:title>Robert Lanier Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K16</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Robert Lanier was born in Memphis in 1938, and has spent most of his life in the city. His contributions to the Memphis law community began after he completed his Bachelor of Science from Memphis State University (now U of M) and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Mississippi, in 1960 and 1962 respectively. Lanier received the American Spirit of Honor Medal in 1963. He was a member of the Memphis law firm of Armstrong, McAdden, Allen, Braden and Goodman from 1964-1968, as well as Farris, Hancock, Gilman, Branan, Lanier &amp; Hellen in 1968. After his stints at these two practices, he became the director of the Memphis &amp; Shelby County Junior Bar Association in 1969-1970, as well as secretary of that same organization in 1971. During this time, he was appointed as special judge at both Circuit and General Sessions Courts, and the Memphis City Court. He served as a judge from 1969 until his retirement in 2004. Lanier also served as an Adjunct Professor at the Memphis State University School of Law (U of M) from 1981, and was a member of the Shelby County Republican Executive Committee, from 1970-1972. He was involved in both the Memphis and Tennessee Humane Associations. Starting out as director of the former in 1972, he eventually became president of both, in Memphis in 1974 and as the state’s from 1975-1977. 
Lanier has a robust history of involvement in Memphis’ civil society – he founded the Lawyers’ Journal Club of Memphis in 1979, for example, and was a member of the Tennessee Historical Commission from 1977, having been appointed by former Governor Ray Blanton to a five-year term. Importantly, he was also a founder of Memphis Heritage Inc., a historical preservation group still active today. He is the author of several books about Memphis history, including Memphis in the Twenties (1979), In the Courts (1969) and The History of the Memphis &amp; Shelby County Bar (1981). It is from his association with Memphis history that Lanier’s collection of photographs can be best understood.
The photographs Lanier has donated are almost certainly a part of Lanier’s personal interest with Memphis history and historical preservation. The photographs which form the Robert Lanier Collection are primarily concerned with documenting Memphis’ streets and urban and public spaces. As well as photographing Memphis attractions, such as Court Square or Overton Park, Lanier has also taken many photos of Memphis buildings and storefronts. There is an obvious interest in how buildings such as the Exchange Building, the Lincoln American Tower and the Tennessee Club Building all fit into Memphis’ urban fabric, and his commitment to these subjects and others over time proves an intention of documenting these spaces for posterity, to show how Memphis has both changed and remained the same. His attention to the less well-known buildings of Memphis, small Midtown houses or neglected or vacant properties, is also important in creating a representative portrait of the urban environment.  Interestingly, as part of this, Lanier has also been preoccupied with photographing many demolition and construction sites around the city – recognition that the documentation of the absence of a building can be just as historically significant as that of one still standing.

Biographical Note
Robert Lanier was born in Memphis in 1938, and has spent most of his life in the city. His
contributions to the Memphis law community began after he completed his Bachelor of Science
from Memphis State University (now U of M) and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of
Mississippi, in 1960 and 1962 respectively. Lanier received the American Spirit of Honor Medal
in 1963. He was a member of the Memphis law firm of Armstrong, McAdden, Allen, Braden and
Goodman from 1964­1968,
as well as Farris, Hancock, Gilman, Branan, Lanier &amp; Hellen in
1968. After his stints at these two practices, he became the director of the Memphis &amp; Shelby
County Junior Bar Association in 1969­1970,
as well as secretary of that same organization in
1971. During this time, he was appointed as special judge at both Circuit and General Sessions
Courts, and the Memphis City Court. He served as a judge from 1969 until his retirement in
2004. Lanier also served as an Adjunct Professor at the Memphis State University School of Law
(U of M) from 1981, and was a member of the Shelby County Republican Executive Committee,
from 1970­1972.
He was involved in both the Memphis and Tennessee Humane Associations.
Starting out as director of the former in 1972, he eventually became president of both, in
Memphis in 1974 and as the state’s from 1975­1977.
Lanier has a robust history of involvement in Memphis’ civil society – he founded the Lawyers’
Journal Club of Memphis in 1979, for example, and was a member of the Tennessee Historical
Commission from 1977, having been appointed by former Governor Ray Blanton to a five­year
term. Importantly, he was also a founder of Memphis Heritage Inc., a historical preservation
group still active today. He is the author of several books about Memphis history, including
Memphis in the Twenties (1979), In the Courts (1969) and The History of the Memphis &amp; Shelby
County Bar (1981). It is from his association with Memphis history that Lanier’s collection of
photographs can be best understood.
The photographs Lanier has donated are almost certainly a part of Lanier’s personal interest with
Memphis history and historical preservation. The photographs which form the Robert Lanier
Collection are primarily concerned with documenting Memphis’ streets and urban and public
spaces. As well as photographing Memphis attractions, such as Court Square or Overton Park,
Lanier has also taken many photos of Memphis buildings and storefronts. There is an obvious
interest in how buildings such as the Exchange Building, the Lincoln American Tower and the
Tennessee Club Building all fit into Memphis’ urban fabric, and his commitment to these
subjects and others over time proves an intention of documenting these spaces for posterity, to
show how Memphis has both changed and remained the same. His attention to the less
well­known
buildings of Memphis, small Midtown houses or neglected or vacant properties, is
also important in creating a representative portrait of the urban environment. Interestingly, as
part of this, Lanier has also been preoccupied with photographing many demolition and
2
construction sites around the city – recognition that the documentation of the absence of a
building can be just as historically significant as that of one still standing.
Scope and Content
The Robert Lanier Collection is made up of urban and street photography of Memphis. It
consists of one box and eight folders. The collection was donated to the library by Mr. Lanier.
Prior to processing, the photographs were organized three ways ­in
one photograph album, as
loose­leaf
and in labeled and dated envelopes; all are photographs of the city of Memphis. The
original order of photographs has been maintained throughout. They are arranged in four­pocket
protective sleeves rather than individually to preserve the coherency of the original arrangement.
A particular focus of the collection is on houses and public spaces. Ranging in date from the
1950s until the first decade of the twenty­first
century, the bulk of the collection consists of
photographs from the 1970s and 1980s, with much of the photography focusing on downtown
and Midtown Memphis. All of the photographs in the Robert Lanier Collection have been
digitized, and are available on the library’s Dig Memphis digital archive website.
Single photocopies or scans of unpublished writings in these papers may be made for purposes of
scholarly research.

Folders one through five consist of photographs previously displayed within the photograph
album; folders five and six hold photographs that were previously loose­leaf,
all are panoramic;
folders seven and eight are almost all individually dated and were previously housed in labeled
envelopes. Not all photographs are dated or ordered chronologically, and at times chronological
order varies widely. For this reason, the approach to listing the majority of the contents of the
collection was by subject rather than by dates. As a reference point, and as noted before, the bulk
of photographs (both dated and undated) originate (or seem to originate), from the 1970s and
1980s.

<dc:description>Marion Scudder Griffin was the first female attorney in the state of Tennessee, as well as the first woman to serve in the Tennessee General Assembly. Born in 1879, in Greensboro, Georgia, little is known about Marion Scudder Griffin’s early life. In fact, an 1880 Greensboro census lists Marion S. Griffin as six years’ old, which places her birth year in 1874, five years earlier. Griffin worked for some time as a stenographer in Greensboro, where she became interested in law. Upon moving to Memphis, she worked in Judge Thomas M. Scruggs’ office as a stenographer. She also began studying for the acquisition of her own legal license. On February 15, 1900, she was certified by Chancellor Dehaven and Circuit Court Judge Estes for admission to the bar. Despite this, the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Griffin a legal license on the basis of her sex twice, in 1900 and 1901. -- Determined, Griffin began to study at the University of Michigan’s Law School, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree by 1906. She was one of two women in her graduating class. Returning to Tennessee, she spurred the state legislature to pass a law that would give women the right to practice law. Though she was initially “greeted with wisecracks and gaffaws,” she convinced the assembly and a bill was passed on February 13, 1907, and ratified by Governor Patterson two days later. On July 1st of that same year, Griffin was licensed by the Tennessee Supreme Court and sworn in as a member of the local bar. She went on to practice law in Memphis for over 40 years. Her legal practice resided in the Goodwyn Institute Building from 1907 to 1949. -- In 1923, Griffin became the first woman ever elected to the Tennessee General Assembly. As was noted in a Commercial Appeal article of August 3, 1950, Griffin had the support of public figures like C.P.J. Mooney, editor of the Commercial Appeal, during her campaign. She served a single term. During that time she headed the House Social Welfare Committee and promoted various legislation affecting women and children. -- Griffin retired in 1949. She had been an active member of the Memphis Business and Professional Women’s Club and the Memphis League of Women Voters, and she was one of the charter members of the Memphis Chapter of the American Association of University Women. She died January 30, 1957, reportedly age 78, and was buried at Elmwood Cemetery. -- The collection consists of personal documents, collected documents pertaining to Marion Griffin’s life and death, and newspaper clippings from a disassembled scrapbook that cover many of the details of her life.

Marion Scudder Griffin Collection
Scope and Content
The Marion Scudder Griffin Collection is contained within a single box measuring .42 linear
feet. The donor is unknown. The collection consists of personal documents, collected documents
pertaining to Marion Griffin’s life and death, and newspaper clippings from a disassembled
scrapbook that cover many of the details of her life. The newspaper clippings give a sense of
Memphians’ and Tennesseans’ reaction to Marion Griffin’s success as a female attorney and
legislator as well as the political and social climate of her time.
The collection is organized into four folders. The first folder contains some of Marion
Griffin’s personal documents, including several papers related to the will and inheritance of her
aunt, Margaret L. Scudder. The second folder contains miscellaneous documents pertaining to
Griffin’s life and death. The third and fourth folders contain newspaper clippings, taken from a
scrapbook of Griffin’s life. A close relative or Griffin herself likely collected the documents in
the scrapbook. A scant few documents cover her early life, while most pertain to her career as a
lawyer and her tenure as a representative in the Tennessee General Assembly, up until her death
in 1957.
Researchers interested in Memphian woman from this period or the suffrage movement in
Memphis should examine the Mary Graham Love Papers, the J.B. Mann Suffrage Collection,
and the Susanne Conlan Scruggs Collection, who was the wife of Judge Thomas M. Scruggs, for
whom Griffin worked after moving to Memphis.
Single photocopies or scans of unpublished writings in these papers may be made for
purposes of scholarly research.

<dc:description>Wesley McDaniel is a man of many hats. He has held many positions in his life including; soldier, volunteer, community activist, labor activist, Lane and Bowler employee, and Union Planters Bank employee. As a community activist he advocated for the placement of a statue of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis. He spent a good portion of his adult life promoting the idea of a statue. His dream may come true as Memphis is considering a statue of King’s likeness as part of their heritage trail redevelopment plan for South Memphis. As a labor activist he advocated for better working conditions for black workers at Union Planters Bank. Mr. McDaniel is a complicated man to say the least; but, one thing that cannot be questioned is his dedication to making Memphis a better place. -- Wesley McDaniel was born on July 19, 1938 in Memphis, Tennessee. At the age of eighteen he enlisted in the U.S. army and they show his home address as being 2986 Forest Memphis, Tennessee. He was stationed at Fort Ord in Northern California where he served as a field artillery person and also spent a year overseas in service during the Korean War. Later he would be transferred to Fort Rucker in Alabama where he worked as a carpenter’s helper. He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1963 and returned to his hometown of Memphis to begin his civilian career. -- One of the first jobs Mr. McDaniel had once back in Memphis was at the Union Planters Bank main branch. Here is where his fervor for activism would be first kindled. While there, Mr. McDaniel sought better work conditions for black employees. Some of the issues he addressed were long work hours, less pay than white employees, and no retirement plan. The local NAACP got involved with this issue and brought the grievances to the attention of the bank. Unfortunately a few years later his brother would be murdered in Memphis in 1973. During the seventies Mr. McDaniel worked for Lane and Bowler company. While there he was injured on the job and sought workers compensation for his injuries. During his tenure at Lane and Bowler he was also an activist. He fought against racist employment practices such as separate bathrooms and water fountains for black and white employees along with racist language directed toward black employees. Because of his activism he was later fired toward the end of 1989. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission looked into the complaints and offered him $1,500 for a settlement but he refused the offer. -- Mr. McDaniel’s other passion outside of labor activism is community activism. He has spent most of his adult life advocating for a better Memphis. Examples of this can be seen in his constant push for there to be a life-sized statue of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. erected somewhere in the city. Furthermore he has pushed for better public transit in the city of Memphis, advocating for extended bus routes and light rail. Mr. McDaniel was ahead of his time on this issue as Memphis is still dealing with the effects of an inadequate public transit system. -- From military service to a life of activism Mr. McDaniel has been a true asset to the city of Memphis. He is the true embodiment of what Memphis was, is, and can become. The Wesley McDaniel Collection serves as an important insight into the everyday life of a regular Memphian striving to make their community better. </dc:description>

advocating for extended bus routes and light rail. Mr. McDaniel was ahead of his time on this
issue as Memphis is still dealing with the effects of an inadequate public transit system.
From military service to a life of activism Mr. McDaniel has been a true asset to the city
of Memphis. He is the true embodiment of what Memphis was, is, and can become. The Wesley
McDaniel Collection serves as an important insight into the everyday life of a regular Memphian
striving to make their community better.

<dc:title>The Renaissance Music Circle Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K19</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>The Renaissance Music Circle was founded in 1908 by Miss Wilodine Saunders in the Central Gardens neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee.  Saunders gathered nineteen of her friends to informally play and listen to each other's music in her home.  As the group continued to meet, they gave structure to their organization by electing presidents, treasurers, secretaries, and drafting a constitution supported with by-laws.  The Renaissance Music Circle Collection mostly consists of Renaissance Music Circle Programs, a guide that the Circle published every year of the music they performed.  The programs span from 1915 until 2002, and conclude with a 100th Anniversary Memory Book from 2008.</dc:description>

<dc:description>After attending the University of Miami, the University of Memphis in the early 1950s, and a brief sojourn in 1968 at the Internacional Universidad of Saltillo, in Mexico, Marilyn Califf enrolled at the Memphis College of Art, where she studied painting. This was the beginning of a string of artistic achievements ranging over fifty years. She achieved her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1970, but had been exhibiting in and around Memphis since the early 1960s, with a showing in the 6th and 7th Annual Mid-South Exhibitions at the Memphis Brooks Museum in 1961 and 1962. She also exhibited in the Atlanta Drawing Society Exhibition in Atlanta, Georgia in 1965 and was commissioned to complete several public art installations and murals from 1962-67. These were at Margolin Hebrew Academy Day School, the Baron Hirsch Synagogue in Memphis and the Memphis Jewish Community Center. She would later return to the University of Memphis to receive her Master of Fine Arts in 1988. -- A long-time Memphian, Marilyn J. Califf has contributed substantial amounts of time and energy to the city’s art community, as well as enjoying success in many different creative mediums. Califf has established herself firmly within the Mid-South environment, with Memphis as a strong base. She has an impressive exhibition record in photography, drawing, painting, murals and quilting. She has garnered many honors throughout her career, and standouts include First Prize in Oils at the 13th Annual Mid-South exhibition at the Memphis Brooks Museum in 1968, First Prize in Photography at the 1982, 1995 and 1997 National League of American Penwomen, Tennessee State competition, and has permanent gallery representation in Memphis and Jackson, Tennessee, Atlanta, Georgia and Florida. She has also participated in a number of international and American invitational exhibitions, juried competitions and art biennales. -- As relevant to this library’s collection, Califf spent a significant decade of her artistic career interested in quilting. She began by developing a mail-order quilt catalog business in 1972, and continued by teaching quilting and patchwork at the University of Memphis and Southwest Tennessee Community College in 1973. Califf explained her interest as beginning when her mother-in-law passed down a family quilt to her, and that she became intrigued with traditional quilts and how to make contemporary patterns or variations. With that impetus, in 1976 she established a small business, with the title ‘Contemporary Quilts, Home of the Quilt Lady’, which had its office near the corner of Summer Avenue and Highland Street. Califf was instrumental in the design of the quilts, and made the venture a cottage industry of sorts, with a small number of staff who made the quilts to sell. As well as this, Califf collected and curated almost 100 antique quilts herself, which were on display in the store. They helped to contribute to the profile of the medium and helped further a perhaps renewed interest in quilting as an art form. The business closed in 1986 for Califf to pursue further academic achievements. -- It is clear that Califf was passionate about reviving quilting to the mainstream artistic community and maintained a commitment to teaching quilting in an accessible way, with an emphasis on contemporary designs. -- The Marilyn J. Califf Collection is a representation of Califf’s quilting years. It consists of one 5-inch box with thirteen folders. Included in the collection are copies of the artist’s curriculum vitae as well as short artistic statements, with Califf’s ‘Quilt Story’ describing her foray into the medium and business. There are also photographs, contained on a CD, of both traditional quilts and those of Califf’s own patterns; the negatives to this are also included. Larger copies of these photographs will be available in the library’s digital archive. There are painting and collage inventories included, with small-scale photographs of each. As well as this, there are four self-published books, three of them pertaining to quilting and pillow making, written by Califf, as well as a book about gardening, written by Aileene Chasteene. The rest (and the bulk) of the collection consists of original quilt patterns designed by Califf for her business, and which range from 1976 to 1981. These patterns are organized chronologically, and then alphabetically within respective year groups. An effort was made to keep duplicate copies of patterns together, with no more than two of each pattern displayed. All undated patterns are contained at the end of the last folder. </dc:description>

During the late 19th and early 20th century, Memphis was a hot spot in the area for music
publishers and producers. Publishers such as Frayser Hinton and Memphis Music Publishers set
up shop to produce and publish sheet music in Memphis, while other publishers such as A. E.
Blackmar and Blelock &amp; Co put offices in the city. These publishers produced what was popular
at the time, ranging from marches and fox-trots to two-steps and schottisches, all for the piano.
The average music consumer in Memphis also had a variety of music to choose from. All
types of sheet music from New York to Chicago were available to Memphians, though the music
represented in this collection consists mainly of piano scores. The culture of buying dance music
for the piano suggests a great love of music and an interest in musicianship. Perhaps a family
member would play the piano while others would dance or sing to the music.
While purchases of sheet music would dwindle during the Great Depression, new sheet
music would still be produced and published; however, most of the publishing houses in
Memphis shut down. There would be a rise of production in the 1970s, but Memphis had
already hit its heyday in the 19th century.

“All you girls ever talk about are the three C’s—cooks, cotton, and children!” This
remark, made by Merle “Mink” Lawrence’s aunt, Mrs. M. M. Ruffin, as she listened to five
friends chatting one afternoon, started the Dilettante Club in Memphis, Tennessee. Founded in
1919 by Mrs. Giles Bond (Bertha), Mrs. Willis Campbell (Bessie), Mrs. Lewis Haskell (Robin),
Mrs. W. S. Lawrence (Merle), and Mrs. Simpson Tate (Adele), this group of society matrons,
organized for the enjoyment of fine arts, still meet monthly to present and discuss their papers.
Literally meaning “admirer or lover of the arts”, a Dilettante must write an original
research paper focusing on the yearly topic once every two years. She may be asked to host a
meeting on “off” years, held on the first Thursday of the month, October through May, but she is
only allowed to serve water—for the speakers. The final May meeting usually concludes with a
luncheon. Sometimes called “Dils” for short, these ladies collect annual dues that help support
donations to local area food banks and educational institutions like Rhodes College. Since 2007,
the Dils have donated to Shelby County Books from Birth, the local affiliate of Dolly Parton’s
Imagination Library which promotes kindergarten readiness and strengthens family bonds by
providing age­appropriate
books for all children from birth to age five.
There are thirty­five
active members, annually elected officers, and sustaining members.
Their collection at the Memphis Public Library &amp; Information Center contains numerous
photographs from past meetings, minutes and yearbooks dating back to the 1920s, and a score of
miscellaneous documents chronicling their almost one hundred year history, including a few
papers.

Dilettante Club Collection
Scope and Content
Comprised of 1.5 linear feet, the Dilettante Club Collection was donated to the Memphis
Public Library &amp; Information Center in 2010 by Sallie Johnson. The material in this collection
dates from the 1920s through the 2000s and includes meeting minutes, yearbooks, by­laws,
correspondence, history of offices, newspaper clippings, original research papers, photographs,
and treasury files.
The collection was organized into folders while maintaining most of the original order.
Along with numerous copies of yearbooks, the first box houses the paper history of the Dilettante
Club including correspondence between club and community members, recently presented
papers, copies of revised by­laws,
and financial history from 1981­2004.
Boxes 2 and 3 contain
minutes of the monthly meetings documented by secretaries since the first records were kept in
1920. Those interested in Memphis clubs and organizations should also consult the Kennedy
Book Club Collection, the Beethoven Club Programs Collection, the Peabody­Bellevue
Civic
Club Collection, the Memphis Civic Clubs­Jackson
Boulevard and Rozelle Clubs, and the
Military Officers’ Wives Club Collection. The Index to the Memphis Historical Society Papers
and the Index to ‘The Egyptian’ also feature civilian research essays similar to the Dilettante
Club’s.

purposes of scholarly research.

<dc:title>Henry Kahn Collection</dc:title>
<dc:identifier>K30</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Henry Kahn was a businessman who lived in Hardeman County, Tennessee. He and his wife Louise, originally from Germany, immigrated to the United States, and set up a dry goods store in Bolivar, Tennessee in 1844. Located on the Hatchie River, Bolivar established itself as a trading hub and Kahn’s store prospered accordingly. By all accounts he was a successful businessman, and in 1853 relocated to Louisville, Kentucky. Kahn established a similar business in that city, leaving his wife and five children in Bolivar. He retired in 1868, and died in 1880, and left a business legacy for his sons, notably Isaac and Samuel, who continued in the same line of work until the late 1890s.</dc:description>

Biographical Note:
Henry Kahn was a businessman who lived in Hardeman County, Tennessee. He and his wife
Louise, originally from Germany, immigrated to the United States, and set up a dry goods store
in Bolivar, Tennessee in 1844. Located on the Hatchie River, Bolivar established itself as a
trading hub and Kahn’s store prospered accordingly. By all accounts he was a successful
businessman, and in 1853 relocated to Louisville, Kentucky. Kahn established a similar
business in that city, leaving his wife and five children in Bolivar. He retired in 1868, and died
in 1880, and left a business legacy for his sons, notably Isaac and Samuel, who continued in the
same line of work until the late 1890s.

Scope and Content:
The Henry Kahn Collection consists of one box, with three folders, and is almost wholly made
up of personal and business correspondence and receipts of arrears and transactions. It initially
appeared to have been organized as loosely chronological, but eventually deviated from that
format. Aside from that, the collection remains in its original order. The bulk of the collection
ranges in date from the 1820s up until the 1850s, with several items dating from the latter
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Interestingly, the collection contains little of Henry Kahn’s own personal effects. Instead, with
the exception of a short, personal letter to his family, the collection holds items authored by
many other prominent Bolivar residents. Although many of the residents feature more than
once, much of it exists in isolation: there appears to be no overarching relationship between
different pieces in the collection, aside from geographical location. The value of the collection
in fact lies within its fragmented nature. It allows for a unique look at many different facets of
nineteenth­century
Bolivar life, and a window to several of its most prominent founding
citizens and their business, family and social interactions and activities.
Single photocopies or scans of unpublished writings in these papers may be made for purposes
of scholarly research.

<dc:identifier>S34</dc:identifier>
<dc:description>Max Samfield was born in Marksteft, Bavaria on January 23, 1844. His father Samuel was an ordained rabbi under whom Max studied in pursuit of the rabbinate. At the age of twelve, his studies were so advanced that he attended post-Talmudical school. Around 1859, he enrolled in a Talmudic school. While studying at Julius University in Duerzburg, Samfield became interested in Reformed Judaism. He graduated with a doctorate in philosophy and, after an advanced course in linguistic studies, ventured to the United States in 1867. He was installed as the rabbi of Congregation B’nai Zion in Shreveport, Louisiana. Rabbi Samfield advocated for constructive programs in his Shreveport congregation and the larger community. -- In July of 1872, Samfield was elected as rabbi of Congregation Children of Israel in Memphis, Tennessee. He married Pauline Frank in January 26, 1873. Later that year he helped the sick and needy of Memphis when the yellow fever epidemic struck. Five years later, when the epidemic reappeared, the rabbi remained in Memphis and continued to care for the sick. Samfield’s humanitarian efforts during these crises are matched by his continued advocacy for sanitation reform, better public education, organized charities, and prison reform. Samfield was a founder of the Tennessee Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Children, the United Charities of Memphis, and the Young Men’s Hebrew Association. He served as president of the Hebrew Relief Association and first vice-president of the Federation of Jewish Charities of Memphis.

He served as President of the Second Annual Conference of the Southern Rabbinical Association, and he founded The Jewish Spectator in 1885, editing it for nearly thirty years. He remained rabbi for the Congregation Children of Israel for over forty years. Samfield was lauded as a man who could be “identified with every Jewish charitable movement in the South and with every non-sectarian benevolent institution in Memphis and Tennessee.” -- On September 28, 1915, the first day of his retirement as Rabbi Emeritus of Congregation Children of Israel, Max Samfield died. On the day of the funeral, streetcars and vehicles planned a coordinated pause in a moment of remembrance. No flowers were requested at the funeral, as the rabbi and his family saw them as a waste of resources better spent on charity.
